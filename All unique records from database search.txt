AB  - Objective: To determine if the leptin, adiponectin, and leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) can predict weight gain at the end of GnRH analogs (GnRHa) treatment in girls with central precocious puberty (CPP)., Material and methods: Study design: prospective cohort. Serum levels of leptin and adiponectin were determined at diagnosis of CPP. Anthropometry was performed at diagnosis of CPP and every six-months, until treatment with GnRHa was discontinued and they presented menarche. Patients were divided according to BMI<94 and BMI>95 percentile at diagnosis of CPP. The outcome was the increased in weight gain (e.g., from normal weight to overweight) at the end of follow-up. Statistical analysis: repeated measures ANOVA test and Student's t-test were used to compare groups. Logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate the association of leptin and adiponectin levels, as well as LAR values with increased weight gain., Results: Fifty-six CPP patients were studied, 18 had BMI >95 percentile and 38 BMI <94 percentile. Of the 18 patients who initially had BMI >95th, two patients went from obesity to overweight, while among the 38 patients who started with BMI <94th, 21 (55.2%) increased their weight gain at the end of follow-up. This last group had higher leptin levels (8.99 +/- 0.6 vs 6.14 +/- 0.8, p=0.005) and higher LAR values compared to those who remained in the same weight (1.3 +/- 0.5 vs 0.96 +/- 0.56, p=0.01). In the logistic regression analysis, it was found that higher leptin levels and higher LAR values were associated with increased weight gain (RR 1.31, 95%CI 1.03-1.66, RR 4.86, 95%CI 1.10-21.51, respectively), regardless of birth weight, pubertal stage, age, and bone/chronological age ratio., Conclusions: In patients with CPP, leptin levels and higher LAR values appear to be associated with significantly greater weight gain during GhRHa treatment, particularly in girls starting with BMI < 94 percentile.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cardiometabolic factors and adipokines between patients with recently diagnosed CPP and controls without CPP, paired by BMI Z scores (BMIz) and classified into girls with adequate nutritional status and girls who are overweight or obese., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was performed from January 2012 to May 2015 at two tertiary care pediatric centers in Mexico City. We included female patients with idiopathic CPP without other chronic pathology and healthy controls. Patients were divided into groups, BMI < 85th and BMI >= 85th percentile, according to 2000 CDC Growth Charts. Anthropometric data and fasting plasma concentrations of lipids, glucose, insulin, and leptin were assessed., RESULTS: There were 73 patients with CPP and 82 without CPP. Sixty-six patients were matched between the groups; no significant difference was noted between the groups according to zBMI. However, differences in the bone/chronological age relationship, birth weight and proportions in different Tanner stages were observed. Among girls with normal BMI, the percentage of body fat (24.6% vs 18.9%, p < 0.001), serum triglycerides (102.9 vs 54.3 mg/dl, p < 0.001), leptin (7.46 vs 5.4 ng/ml, p = 0.010) and free leptin (0.44 vs 0.29 ng/ml, p = 0.044) were higher in those with CPP; additionally, girls with CPP presented a higher proportion of hypertriglyceridemia. In the overweight/obese group, adiponectin levels were lower in girls with CPP (6.23 vs 7.28 pg/ml, p = 0.011)., CONCLUSIONS: Girls with CPP and normal BMI at diagnosis had a worse cardiometabolic profile, as reflected by higher levels of free leptin, and higher proportion of hypertriglyceridemia than girls without CPP.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Polycystic ovary syndrome is considered to originate during puberty. The aim of this study was to investigate hormonal status in relationship to anthropometric data in girls with premature adrenarche and adolescent girls with hyperandrogenism, as these conditions are related to polycystic ovary syndrome in adulthood., MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 girls with premature adrenarche (aged 4.9-10.2 years), 21 postmenarcheal girls with hirsutism (aged 13.3-17.8 years), 2 groups (n=13 in each) of healthy volunteers of similar age and body mass index participated in the study., RESULTS: Serum testosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels were significantly higher in all patients than in controls. Free androgen index and leptin levels were significantly higher, and sex-hormone-binding globulin lower in hirsute adolescents vs. controls. Birth weight standard deviation scores were comparable in all 4 groups. Serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate negatively correlated with birth weight standard deviation scores in the group of girls with premature adrenarche (r=-0.57, p<0.001). By linear regression, 76% in variation of serum leptin levels could be explained by subscapular skinfold thickness standard deviation scores, and by serum sex-hormone-binding globulin, insulin, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels in all participants. Mean age of onset of menarche was younger in hirsute girls vs. controls (12.1+/-1.3 vs. 13.5+/-1.3 years, p=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: Inverse correlation of dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate levels and weight at birth indicates relationship between premature adrenarche in girls and fetal growth. Higher leptin levels in adolescents with hyperandrogenism than in healthy girls show possible involvement of leptin in pathogenesis of hyperandrogenism.

AB  - Background: A relation between adiponectin and bone homeostasis has been illustrated through studying adiponectin secretion and its receptor presentation in bone forming cells. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between fetal bone turnover and adipokines. Methods: In a cross-sectional study performed in Tehran University of medical sciences related hospitals, 77 samples (39 males, 38 females) of umbilical cord blood immediately after delivery were gathered. Clinical characteristics such as gender, weight, length, weight to length ratio were recorded. Measurements of leptin, adiponectin, osteocalcin and crosslaps were done by ELISA methods in biochemistry and hormone laboratory of endocrinology and metabolism research center. The amounts of crosslaps and osteocalcin were expressed as t-scores, and then t-scores of crosslaps was subtracted from osteocalcin t-scores to establish estimation for bone formation, which we named Bone Formation Index. Results: In Univariate Analysis, after entrance sex, birth weight and birth length as fixed factors, leptin and adiponectin displayed an independent effect on Bone Formation Index. Conclusion: Our data suggest that both leptin and adiponectin have a remarkable impact on bone turnover in fetus.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between serum 11beta-HSD2 mRNA level and insulin sensitivity in term small-for-gestational age (SGA) neonates after birth. The 38 infants were divided into two groups, the SGA group and the appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) group. The placental 11beta-HSD2 mRNA abundance and concentration of cortisol, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, adiponectin, visfatin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-1) in the umbilical vein plasma were measured. The results showed that in the SGA group, neonates had lower levels of placental 11beta-HSD2 mRNA and serum cortisol, and higher fasting insulin and HOMA-IR compared to AGA group. For some insulin sensitivity relative factor, levels of serum adiponectin and IGF-1 were lower while visfatin was higher in the SGA group than AGA group. Correlation analyses revealed that 11beta-HSD2 mRNA level had a negative correlation with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and visfatin.

AB  - Background: Maternal exposure to dibutyl phthalate (DBP) may result in obesity in female offspring. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive.Materials and methods: Sprague-Dawley rats were intraperitoneally injected with different doses of DBP and corn oil from gestational day 7 until the end of lactation. The weights, visceral fat percentage, serum lipid, insulin and glucose, protein levels of PI3K signal pathway in muscle were detected in F1 female offspring.Results: Although the birth weight of F1 female offspring was not different among groups, the weights were heavier in DBP groups from postnatal day 7 to adult (P < 0.001). The visceral adipose percentage in adult female offspring was increased by perinatal exposure to DBP (P < 0.001). Decreased serum level of triglyceride (P = 0.001) in F1 female offspring was found in DBP group as compared to control, especially in medium and high DBP. However, none difference was found for fasting glucose, prolactin, HOMA-IR, fasting insulin, total cholesterol, adiponectin. Different protein levels of GPR30 were observed in muscle of female offspring among four groups (P = 0.016). The protein level of AKT seemed higher in DBP group but without statistical significance (P = 0.05). None difference was observed for the protein levels of PI3K, p-AKT, pAKT/AKT, PTEN, GLUT4, InsR, IRS.Conclusion: Maternal perinatal exposure to DBP might induce obesity and accumulation of visceral adipose tissue for the adult female offspring. Serum glucolipid and local signal transduction of PTEN/PI3K/AKT pathway in muscle were not adversely affected by perinatal exposure to DBP for adult female offspring.

AB  - To investigate the expression of aquaporin 3 (AQP3) in placenta and fetal membranes and the level of adiponectin (ADP) in the umbilical cord blood of severe preeclampsia and to analyze the relationship between the 2 proteins and severe preeclampsia, 60 pregnant women with severe preeclampsia were recruited as the case group and another group of 60 normal pregnant women in the same gestation period were selected as the control. After parturition, the transcriptional levels of AQP3 mRNA in placenta and fetal membranes were evaluated with RT-PCR. The expressions of AQP3 protein in the placenta and fetal membranes were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Meanwhile, the expression of ADP in umbilical artery blood was detected by ELISA. The content of triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and LDL-C/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol in the case group was significantly higher than that in the control group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that the level of TG was related to the onset of severe preeclampsia (OR 2.589). The relative expression of AQP3 mRNA and expression of AQP3 protein in placenta tissue of the case group were significantly lower than those of the control group, whereas in fetal membranes, they were significantly higher. The results of ELISA showed that the level of ADP in umbilical cord blood of neonates in the case group increased remarkably compared with that of the control group. Copyright © 2020 S.

AB  - Background: As an active component from traditional Chinese medicine, trigonelline has a protective effect on diabetes. This study evaluated the protective effects of trigonelline on diabetic mice during pregnancy. Methods: Diabetes was induced in female mice by intraperitoneal injection for continuous 5-day of 40 mg/kg/day streptozotocin. Female mice were divided into 4 groups after they were allowed to mate with normal male mice: nondiabetic, nondiabetic treated with trigonelline (70 mg/kg) for 18 days, diabetic, and diabetic treated with trigonelline (70 mg/kg). Results: Diabetic pregnant mice had significantly higher levels of blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, insulin, and leptin but lower serum omentin-1 level and insulin sensitivity index than the nondiabetic ones. Trigonelline improved the hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and adipocytokine of diabetic pregnant mice. Diabetic pregnant mice had significantly reduced fetus numbers, fetal weight, and fetal/placental ratio, which were reversed by trigonelline. Trigonelline prevented the increase in proinflammatory cytokines and reduced interleukin-10 level in placenta of diabetic pregnant mice. Trigonelline increased beta-cell replication and the decreased beta-cell mass, and decreased the beta-cell apoptosis of diabetic pregnant mice. Conclusion: These findings suggest that trigonelline protects diabetic pregnancy partly by suppressing inflammation, regulating the secretion of adipocytokines, increasing beta-cell mass, replication, and decreasing beta-cell apoptosis.

AB  - Objective . High-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMW-adiponectin) and leptin are two important adipokines. The aim of this study was to examine the association between the two adipokines and anthropometric measurements of neonates at birth. Furthermore, we would like to explore whether HMW-adiponectin and leptin correlate with insulin sensitivity in neonates. Methods. Venous cord blood samples were obtained from 266 full-term healthy neonates consecutively born at Peking Union Medical College Hospital. HMW-adiponectin, leptin, blood glucose, and insulin concentrations were measured. Results . HMW-adiponectin and leptin were significantly higher in females compared with males (P = 0.031 and P = 0.000, resp.). Univariate correlation analysis showed that leptin concentrations in cord blood were positively associated with gestational age, birth weight, body length, ponderal index, placenta weight, insulin, and insulin sensitivity (all P < 0.001). However, there was no correlation between cord blood HMW-adiponectin levels and foetal anthropometric measurements or foetal insulin sensitivity indicators (all P > 0.05). Multivariate linear regression analysis indicated that leptin (B = -0.126, P = 0.045) in cord blood was independently associated with insulin sensitivity. Conclusions . Leptin concentrations, but not HMW-adiponectin, were positively associated with foetal anthropometric measurements. Leptin concentrations are significantly associated with foetal insulin sensitivity, and there were no significant correlations between HMW-adiponectin levels and foetal insulin sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate different factors related to fetal growth restriction (FGR) and to find out the possible causes of FGR with unclear etiologies., METHODS: Sixty-three women who were suspected of FGR during pregnancy between March 2002 and March 2003 were included in this study. Their age, body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, and gestational weeks were recorded at the time when they were first diagnosed. Haemoglobin levels, haematocrit (HCT), TORCH, anticardiolipin antibody (ACA), 50 gram glucose challenge test (50g GCT), 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test (75g OGTT), leptin levels, systolic/diastolic (S/D) ratio by color doppler monitor and chlamydia trachomatis (CT) were detected and urine culture was done in these groups during the same period. The gestational week, birth weight, body length and the gender were recorded at the delivery period. The FGR group was then divided into two subgroups according to the birth weights: study A group whose birth weights were lower than 10th% of the birth weights at the given gestational weeks (29 cases) and study B group whose birth weights were beyond 10th% (34 cases). The chromosome, leptin, C-peptide, insulin and TORCH of umbilical blood were measured at delivery. The other 25 normal pregnant women were included as control and the same tests were performed accordingly., RESULTS: The fasting glucose and the third hour's glucose of 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test of study A were (3.8 +/- 0.6) mmol/L and (4.5 +/- 1.1) mmol/L. The fetal leptin, C-peptide, and insulin were (7.3 +/- 5.2) ng/ml, (0.5 +/- 0.3) nmol/L and (2.3 +/- 1.3) mU/L. The S/D ratio of umbilical artery, maternal and fetal infection rate of CMV, positive rate of ACA-IgM and the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria were 3.06, 20.7%, 24.1%, 44.8% and 62.1% respectively. The fasting glucose and the third hour's glucose of 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test of study B were (4.4 +/- 0.7) mmol/L and (4.6 +/- 1.1) mmol/L. The fetal leptin, C-peptide, and insulin were (13.2 +/- 11.3) ng/ml, (0.7 +/- 0.4) nmol/L and (4.3 +/- 3.3) mU/L. The S/D ratio of umbilical artery, maternal and fetal infection rate of CMV, positive rate of ACA-IgM and the rate of asymptomatic bacteriuria were 2.63, 2.9%, 0%, 5.9% and 44.1% respectively. The fasting glucose and the third hour's glucose of 75 gram oral glucose tolerance test in control were (4.3 +/- 0.7) mmol/L and (5.3 +/- 1.2) mmol/L. The fetal leptin, C-peptide, and insulin were (20.5 +/- 12.0) ng/ml, (1.0 +/- 0.4) nmol/L and (6.3 +/- 4.0) mU/L. The S/D ratio of umbilical artery, maternal and fetal infection rate of CMV, positive rate of ACA-IgM and the rate of the asymptomatic bacteriuria were 2.80, 0, 0, 0 and 24.0% respectively. All these items were significantly higher in study A than those in the control (P < 0.05). There was no significant difference between the study B and the control in all the items., CONCLUSIONS: Many factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of FGR, including the maternal blood glucose level, the ability for fetus to use the glucose, the infection of some microorganisms, insufficiency of the blood supply and the autoimmunity of the mother. Finding out the possible causes of FGR and managing them accordingly may improve the outcomes of the fetus.

AB  - Objective: The aim of this study was to assess whether size for gestational age and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) are associated with cardiometabolic risk in central precocious puberty (CPP) girls. Method(s): The retrospective study included 443 patients with newly diagnosed CPP. Subjects were categorized by birth weight for gestational age (appropriate [AGA], small [SGA], and large [LGA] for gestational age) and serum DHEAS concentration (high [>=75th percentile] and normal [<75th percentile] DHEAS). Cardiometabolic parameters were examined. Composite cardiometabolic risk (CMR) score was calculated based on BMI, blood pressure, glucose, insulin, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol. Non-obesity CMR score was computed, omitting the value from BMI. Logistic regression models, general linear models, and partial correlation analyses were used to evaluate associations. Propensity score matching was performed for sensitivity analyses. Result(s): Overall, 309 patients (69.8%) were born AGA, 80 (18.1%) were born SGA, and 54 (12.2%) were born LGA. Compared with AGA counterparts, CPP girls born SGA were more prone to have elevated HbA1c (adjusted OR = 4.54; 95% CI, 1.43-14.42) and low HDL cholesterol (adjusted OR = 2.33; 95% CI, 1.18-4.61). In contrast, being born LGA was not associated with increased risk for any glucose or lipid derangements. Despite the fact that elevated CMR score was more common among individuals born LGA than AGA (adjusted OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.07-4.35), no significant difference was found on non-obesity CMR score (adjusted OR = 0.75; 95% CI, 0.30-1.88). When controlling for age, birth weight SDS, and current BMI-SDS, individuals with high DHEAS exhibited higher HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 concentrations and lower triglyceride level and non-obesity CMR score. Furthermore, DHEAS correlated positively with HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-1 and negatively with triglyceride, prominently in girls born SGA, after adjustments for the three abovementioned confounders. Sensitivity analyses corroborated the findings. Conclusion(s): Among CPP girls, those born SGA were more likely to possess cardiometabolic risk factors compared to their AGA peers. The difference we observed in cardiometabolic risk between individuals born LGA and AGA was driven by BMI. High DHEAS was associated with favorable lipid profile in CPP girls, even in subjects born SGA.Copyright © 2023 Zhang, Yu, Yu, Luo, Liang, Hou and Wu.

AB  - Severe pre-eclampsia is a leading cause of maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. This retrospective study explored pregnancy outcome predictive values of umbilical artery Doppler with serum adiponectin in severe pre-eclampsia. Fasting elbow venous blood was collected from 118 severe pre-eclampsia patients [maternal systolic pressure >= 160 mmHg and/or diastolic pressure >= 110 mmHg + minimal proteinuria, 56; mild hypertension + heavy proteinuria (>=2 g/24 h or random urinary protein >= 2+), 42; no proteinuria but new-onset hypertension + diseases of heart/lung/liver/kidney/other organs or abnormalities in blood/digestive/nervous systems, placental foetus involved, 20] and 90 controls (18.5-24.9 kg/m2) in the first morning of admission. Serum adiponectin and resistance/pulsatility indexes were separately measured and correlatively analysed by Pearson's coefficient analysis. Adverse outcomes included maternal primary postpartum haemorrhage and placental abruption, neonatal asphyxia, low birth weight, foetal distress, foetal growth restriction. In severe pre-eclampsia, serum adiponectin (downregulated) was negatively-correlated with resistance/pulsatility indexes (upregulated). The area under the curve of umbilical artery Doppler with serum adiponectin for predicting adverse outcomes of severe pre-eclampsia was 0.6545 (specificity 60.27%, sensitivity 60.00%). In conclusion, umbilical artery Doppler with serum adiponectin predicts adverse pregnancy outcomes in severe pre-eclampsia.Impact statementWhat is already known on this subject? Sad levels were lowered in sPE patients. UA ultrasound hemodynamic parameters can predict adverse pregnancy outcomes. What do the results of this study add? Our study revealed that ultrasonic hemodynamic indexes of UA combined with Sad levels had better efficacy in predicting pregnancy outcomes in patients with sPE, and our study is expected to improve the accuracy of clinical prediction of adverse outcomes in sPE patients. What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? Through the combined detection of multiple indicators of the foetus in the mother, our study expects to be able to monitor and predict the growth of the foetus in the mother more accurately in clinical practice, avoid excessive intervention or untimely intervention, and reduce the incidence of perinatal adverse pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Chemerin is an adipokine that regulates metabolism in pregnancy. An elevation of serum chemerin level is associated with pregnancy complications. Consistently, we demonstrated that the chemerin expression was increased in placenta of preeclamptic patients at deliveries. The G protein-coupled receptor chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) mediates the actions of chemerin. The functions of the chemerin-CMKLR1 axis in maintaining pregnancy are still unknown. In this study, we demonstrated that CMKLR1 was expressed in the decidual natural killer (dNK) cells and chorionic villi of human. Chemerin suppressed the proliferation of the dNK cells in vitro. Specific antagonist of CMKLR1, alpha-Neta abolished the suppressive effect of spent medium from chemerin-treated dNK cells culture on extravillous trophoblast invasion. Activation of the chemerin-CMKLR1 axis promoted fusion and differentiation of human cytotrophoblast to syncytiotrophoblast in vitro. We generated Cmklr1 knockout mice and showed that the Cmklr1 deficiency negatively affected pregnancy outcome in terms of number of implantation sites, litter size and fetal weight at birth. Histologically, the Cmklr1 deficiency impaired formation of the syncytiotrophoblast layer II, induced enlargement of the maternal lacunae in the labyrinth, increased the diameter of the spiral arteries and increased trophoblast invasion in the decidua. The Cmklr1 deficient placenta also displayed an increased number of dNK cells and serum IL-15 level. In summary, the chemerin-CMKLR1 axis regulated placental development and spiral artery remodeling in early pregnancy. Copyright © 2022 Zhang, Xiao, Lee, Duan, Fan, Yeung, Chiu and Zhang.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Paraben exposure is linked to the release of adipokine such as leptin and adiponectin, and both paraben and adipokine may affect fetal growth. The present study aimed to explore the associations among maternal paraben exposure, adipokine level and offspring size., METHODS: 942 mother-newborn pairs from the Sheyang Mini Birth Cohort Study (SMBCS) were enrolled. Data of birth weight, length, head circumference and ponderal index (PI) were obtained from medical records. Maternal urinary parabens were determined by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Cord serum leptin and adiponectin were measured using ELISA assay. Generalized linear regression was applied to explore the associations among parabens, adipokines and offspring size., RESULTS: The median levels of leptin and adiponectin were 13.13 mug/L and 161.82 mug/mL. Benzylparaben level was positively associated with leptin (regression coefficient (beta) = 0.06, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.09; p < 0.01). Leptin level was positively associated with neonatal weight (beta = 84.11, 95% CI: 63.22-105.01; p < 0.01), length (beta = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.14-0.37; p < 0.01), head circumference (beta = 0.15, 95% CI: 0.07-0.22; p < 0.01) and PI (beta = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.08-0.39; p < 0.01). Adiponectin was positively associated with neonatal weight (beta = 75.94, 95% CI: 29.65-122.23; p < 0.01) and PI (beta = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.09-0.77; p = 0.01). Urinary propylparaben concentration (beta = -0.10, 95% CI: -0.17 to -0.02; p = 0.01) was negatively associated with head circumference. Sex-stratified analyses indicated the negative association of propylparaben and head circumference was only remained in male neonates., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal paraben exposure might affect cord serum leptin levels. Both paraben and adipokine levels may affect fetal growth, and sex-specific differences may exist. Copyright © 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triclosan is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial, and was thought to affect intrauterine development, but the mechanism remains unclear., OBJECTIVE: To explore the association between prenatal triclosan exposure and birth outcomes., METHODS: Based on 726 mother-child pairs from the Sheyang Mini Birth Cohort Study (SMBCS), we used the available (published) data of triclosan in maternal urines, the hormones including thyroid-related hormones, gonadal hormones in cord blood, and adipokines, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) and its precursors in cord blood to explore possible health effects of triclosan on birth outcomes through assessing different hormones and parameters, using Bayesian mediation analysis., RESULTS: Maternal triclosan exposure was associated with ponderal index (beta = 0.317) and head circumference (beta = -0.172) in generalized linear models. In Bayesian mediation analysis of PI model, estradiol (beta = 0.806) and trimethylamine (TMA, beta = 0.164) showed positive mediation effects, while total thyroxine (TT4, beta = -0.302), leptin (beta = -2.023) and TMAO (beta = -0.110) showed negative mediation effects. As for model of head circumference, positive mediation effects were observed in free thyroxine (FT4, beta = 0.493), TMA (beta = 0.178), and TMAO (beta = 0.683), negative mediation effects were observed in TT4 (beta = -0.231), testosterone (beta = -0.331), estradiol (beta = -1.153), leptin (beta = -2.361), choline (beta = -0.169), betaine (beta = -0.104), acetyl-L-carnitine (beta = -0.773)., CONCLUSION: The results indicated triclosan can affect intrauterine growth by interfering thyroid-related hormones, gonadal hormones, adipokines, TMAO and its precursors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is defined as a fetus that fails to achieve its genetically determined growth potential. The exact molecular mechanisms of placental insufficiency IUGR pathogenesis are a little known. Our goal was to identify key genes and gene co-expression modules related to placental insufficiency IUGR., METHODS: We used weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to examine the IUGR dataset GSE114691 from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. Core modules and hub nodes of the protein-protein interaction network were identified. A gene network was constructed and genes were classified by WGCNA into different modules. The validation of potential key genes was carried out using additional datasets (GSE12216 and GSE24129)., RESULTS: We identified in GSE114691 539 down regulated genes and 751 up regulated genes in placental tissues characteristic of placental insufficiency IUGR compared with non-IUGR, and defined 76 genes as hub nodes in the protein-protein interaction network. Genes in the key modules of the WGCNA network were most closely associated with placental insufficiency IUGR and significantly enriched in biological process such as cellular metabolic process and macromolecule metabolic process. We identified as key genes TGFB1, LEP, ENG, ITGA5, STAT5A, LYN, GATA3, FPR1, TGFB2, CEBPB, KLF4, FLT1, and PNPLA2. The RNA expression levels of ENG and LEP, as biomarkers, were validated., CONCLUSION: A holistic gene expression profile of placental insufficiency IUGR has been generated and the key genes ENG and LEP has potential to serve as circulating diagnosis biomarkers and therapeutic targets for placental insufficiency IUGR.

However, no studies have examined the underlying mechanism through cross-omics of lipidome and adipokines profiling, as well as the possible effect modification by maternal hyperlipidemia. In total, 203 mother-newborn pairs were recruited in the birth cohort study ongoing since February 2017 in Beijing, China. Individual-level of PM2.5 exposure was estimated using a satellite data based random forest model. Cord blood lipidome and adipokines were assessed through the lipidomic approaches and antibody-based array. Multivariable logistic/linear regression models and moderation analysis were employed in this study. We observed a significantly increased risk of PTB associated with PM2.5 exposure during the second trimester, especially in pregnant women with pre-existing hyperlipidemia. 9 lipid classes and 21 adipokines were associated with PM2.5 exposure independently or significantly influenced by the interaction of maternal PM2.5 exposure and hyperlipidemia. In addition, 4 adipokines (ANGPTL4, IGFBP-2, IL-12p40, and TNF-RII) and 3 lipid classes [phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylinositols (PIs), and triglycerides (TGs)] were related to the increased risk of PTB, indicating that inflammation, IGF/IGFBP axis, and lipolysis induced lipid homeostasis disorder of PCs, TGs, and PIs might be the possible mediators for the PM2.5-induced adverse birth outcomes. Our results substantiated the need for reducing exposure in susceptible populations. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The evidence that fetal life and early infancy are "critical" or "sensitive" ages for later development of cardiometabolic disease is based on flawed methods for comparing different age periods. Moreover, most previous studies have limited their focus to weight gain, rather than growth in length/height or body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)(2)). We undertook a secondary analysis of data from the Promotion of Breastfeeding Intervention Trial (1996-2010), a birth cohort study nested within a large cluster-randomized trial in the Republic of Belarus, that had repeated measurements of weight and length/height taken from birth to 11.5 years of age. We used mixed-effects linear models to analyze associations of changes in standardized weight, length/height, and body mass index during 5 age periods (conception to birth, birth to age 3 months, ages 3-12 months, ages 12 months-6.5 years, and ages 6.5-11.5 years) with fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance, beta-cell function, and adiponectin at age 11.5 years. We observed strong associations between the metabolic markers and all 3 growth measures, with the largest magnitudes being observed during the latest age period (ages 6.5-11.5 years) and negligible associations during gestation and the first year of life. Later age periods appear more "sensitive" than earlier periods to the adverse metabolic association with rapid growth in childhood.

AB  - Pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) may have adverse pregnancy outcomes, even if their blood glucose level is well-controlled. Aquaporin 3 (AQP3) and adiponectin (APN) serve important roles in fetal growth and development. However, the associations of AQP3 and APN with GDM and pregnancy outcome are not known. Therefore, the present study was performed to evaluate the expression of AQP3 in the placenta and APN in the umbilical artery blood, and the association of the two factors with GDM and pregnancy outcome. The patient cohort was divided into two groups: Pregnant women with GDM; and pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT). The expression levels of AQP3 in the placenta and APN in the umbilical artery blood were detected. Logistic regression was used to analyze the associations of AQP3 and APN with GDM and pregnancy outcome. The expression levels of AQP3 and AQP3 mRNA in the placenta of the GDM group were decreased compared with that of the NGT group, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). The expression of APN in the umbilical artery blood of the GDM group was also decreased compared with that of the NGT group, and the difference was also statistically significant (P<0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that the AQP3 and APN levels were negatively correlated not only with the risk of developing GDM [AQP3 odds ratio (OR)=5.00 (P<0.01); APN OR=2.98 (P=0.01)], but also with abnormal pregnancy outcome [(AQP3 OR=4.64 (P<0.01); APN OR=5.41 (P<0.01)]. The levels of AQP3 in the placenta and APN in the umbilical cord blood were associated with GDM, and the risk of GDM was increased in pregnant women with decreased AQP3 and APN levels. The AQP3 and APN levels also had an effect on pregnancy outcome. The risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes, including cesarean section, macrosomia, fetal distress and neonatal asphyxia, was increased in pregnant women with decreased AQP3 and APN levels.

AB  - The relationship between growth and immune phenotypes has been presented in the context of physiology and energy allocation theory, but has rarely been explained genetically in humans. As more summary statistics of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) become available, it is increasingly possible to explore the genetic relationship between traits at the level of genome-wide summary statistics. In this study, publicly available summary statistics of growth and immune related traits were used to evaluate the genetic correlation coefficients between immune and growth traits, as well as the cause and effect relationship between them. In addition, pleiotropic variants and KEGG pathways were identified. As a result, we found negative correlations between birthweight and immune cell count phenotypes, a positive correlation between childhood head circumference and eosinophil counts (EO), and positive or negative correlations between childhood body mass index and immune phenotypes. Statistically significant negative effects of immune cell count phenotypes on human height, and a slight but significant negative influence of human height on allergic disease were also observed. A total of 98 genomic regions were identified as containing variants potentially related to both immunity and growth. Some variants, such as rs3184504 located in SH2B3, rs13107325 in SLC39A8, and rs1260326 located in GCKR, which have been identified to be pleiotropic SNPs among other traits, were found to also be related to growth and immune traits in this study. Meanwhile, the most frequent overlapping KEGG pathways between growth and immune phenotypes were autoimmune related pathways. Pleiotropic pathways such as the adipocytokine signaling pathway and JAK-STAT signaling pathway were also identified to be significant. The results of this study indicate the complex genetic relationship between growth and immune phenotypes, and reveal the genetic background of their correlation in the context of pleiotropy.

AB  - AIM: Vulnerability to insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes may originate in early life, but little is known about whether any perinatal biomarkers are predictive of later metabolic health. We sought to assess whether cord blood insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin are associated with metabolic health indicators in infancy., METHODS: In a prospective singleton birth cohort, we assessed cord blood insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin concentrations in relation to the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), beta-cell function (HOMA-beta), fasting proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, BMIz-score, and the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness (an indicator of adiposity) in infants at age 1 year (n = 185)., RESULTS: Adjusting for maternal and infant characteristics, one standard deviation (sd) increase in cord blood adiponectin was associated with an 11.1% (95% confidence interval 1.8-19.5%) decrease in HOMA-beta (P = 0.02) and a 13.6% (1.8-26.8%) increase in proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (P = 0.02), indicating worse beta-cell function in infants at age 1 year. One sd increase in cord blood insulin was associated with a 0.5 (0.1-1.0) mm increase in skinfold thickness (P = 0.01). One sd increase in cord blood ghrelin was associated with a 0.2 (0.02-0.3) decrease in BMIz-score (P = 0.02) and a 0.5 (0.1-0.9) mm decrease (P = 0.02) in skinfold thickness. Cord blood IGF-I and IGF-II were not associated with the observed metabolic health indicators at age 1 year., CONCLUSION: The study is the first to show that cord blood adiponectin may be negatively predictive of beta-cell function, whereas cord blood ghrelin may be negatively predictive of adiposity in infancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the concentrations of nesfatin-1 in maternal and cord serum, to evaluate the expression of nesfatin-1 in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and those with normal glucose tolerance (NGT)., METHODS: We studied a total of 50 GDM and 50 NGT subjects. The clinical features, serum nesfatin-1, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), lipid profiles were measured at the third trimester of pregnancy. The expression of nesfatin-1 in the SAT was determined by western blot., RESULTS: Compared with the NGT group, the GDM group showed greater levels of serum nesfatin-1, adipocyte fatty acid binding protein (AFABP), and leptin; a greater level of cord blood nesfatin-1; and a higher level of expression in SAT (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01). Fasting insulin (FI) (b = 0.317, p= 0.022) and body mass index (BMI) before delivery (b = 0.367, p=0.008) were independently associated with serum nesfatin-1. Nesfatin-1 was the independent risk factor for GDM., CONCLUSIONS: The GDM group had higher levels of maternal serum and cord blood nesfatin-1, and greater nesfatin-1 expression in SAT. Nesfatin-1 is closely related to obesity and IR in pregnancy.

AB  - To investigate the mechanisms of maternal-fetal interactions in the setting of gestational diabetes mellitus. We investigated the long-term effects of intrauterine mild hyperglycemia and a postnatal high-fat diet on the glucose metabolism of adult offspring, and explored the role of adiponectin on hepatic gluconeogenesis. Twenty-one pregnant Wistar rats were randomly divided into an intrauterine hyperglycemia group (group D, n = 14) and a control group (group C, n = 7). Offspring were divided into four groups according to intrauterine blood glucose level and post-weaning dietary patterns (high-fat diet groups: DF and CF or normal diet groups: DN and CN, n = 8 per group). The average birth weights of group D offspring were higher than for group C. In the DF rats, low adiponectin mRNA expression in perirenal and epididymal fat was significantly positively correlated with low hepatic AdipoR1 mRNA expression and significantly correlated with high hepatic PEPCK, G-6-Pase, and PGC-1 alpha mRNA levels. In DF rats, hepatic P-AMPK was cytoplasmically located and its level was decreased; in these rats, hepatic CRTC2 was expressed in the nucleus and its level was significantly increased. Our study shows that the dietary structure of offspring has a large influence on the incidence of abnormal glucose tolerance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin is an adipocyte hormone involved in energy homeostasis and metabolism. However, its role in early infancy is poorly understood., METHODS: We recruited a total of 443 pregnant women and their children in this prospective study. Cord blood samples were successfully obtained from 331 neonates. Maternal and umbilical blood serum adiponectin were measured. The weight-, height- and BMI-for-age Z scores of infants at birth and at 3, 6 and 12 months of age were assessed., RESULTS: Multiple linear regression analysis indicated that cord blood but not maternal serum adiponectin was positively associated with all of the anthropometric measures at birth (P < 0.01). Using Generalized Estimating Equation model after adjustment for sex, time, maternal age, gestational age, prepregnancy BMI, weight gain during pregnancy, maternal education, parity, history of miscarriage and mode of delivery, for every 1-mug/ml increment of maternal serum adiponectin, the height-for-age Z score during the first year of life increased by 0.026 (P =0.013) on average, and the height-for-age Z score of infants in the highest quartile of maternal serum adiponectin was 0.270 (95 % CI: 0.013-0.527) higher than those in the lowest quartile. The changes in weight-for-age Z score from birth decreased by 0.67 x 10(-2) on average with every 1-mug/ml additional increase of cord blood adiponectin (P = 0.047). The infants in the highest quartile of cord blood adiponectin showed a -0.368 (95 % CI, -0.701--0.035) decrease in weight-for-age Z score change from birth compared with those in the lowest quartile., CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood adiponectin concentration is a determinant of infant birth size and weight gain in the first year of life. Circulating maternal adiponectin during pregnancy may predict postnatal height growth.

AB  - Accumulating evidences indicate that bisphenol A (BPA) exposure during early development increases the risk of obesity and insulin resistance in later life. Despite growing public concern, it is not totally clear about the mechanism of BPA. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of perinatal exposure to BPA on body weight, glucose metabolism and adipokine expression in adolescent female offspring rats. Pregnant rats were exposed to BPA in water at levels of either 1 mu g/mL (LBPA) or 10 mu g/mL (HBPA) from gestation day 6 to the end of lactation. Body weight, the levels of fasting serum glucose, insulin and adiponectin (ADP), and Zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG) and ADP mRNA and protein expression from adipose tissue in 7 weeks old female offspring were measured. There were high birth weight and high body weight at age of 7 weeks in BPA treated group. There were significantly higher levels of serum glucose and insulin, and lower levels of serum ADP and plasma ZAG protein, and lower ADP and ZAG mRNA and protein expression in BPA-exposed female offspring compared with controls. The results suggested that BPA-exposed during early development had long-term deleterious effects on body weight and glucose metabolism, which was probably associated with the down-regulated expression of ZAG and ADP gene in early developmental female rats.

AB  - ACRP30 gene was located nearby the QTL affecting the marbling, ribeye muscle area and fat thickness on the BAT1 in Angus. In this study, a 5bp deletion mutation within the bovine ACRP30 gene was firstly detected and confirmed in 991 cattle by PCR-SSCP, DNA sequencing and direct PCR amplification. The deletion mutation was appeared in Qinchuan, Nanyang, Jiaxian and Hasake, but was not found in Jinnan, Chinese Holsteins and Angus. The association of the deletion polymorphism with growth traits (including birth weight, body weight, average daily gain and body sizes in different growth periods (6/12/18/24 month-old)) was analyzed in 224 Nanyang cattle. No signification association of the deletion polymorphism with growth traits were observed (P > 0.05). The deletion was located in the promoter region and it resulted in a new putative CCAAT/enhancer binding protein-beta response element (C/EBP-RE).

AB  - Objective: To observe the effect of prenatal alcohol on blood glucose in newborn rats and study its mechanism. Method(s): Six female Wistar rats were divided randomly into two groups, the rats in one group were given ethanol 4 g . kg-1 . d-1 by gavage untill delivery (ETOH group), the rats in another group were given the same volume water (control group). 12 newborn rats from both groups were chosen randomly. The mRNA level of adipose leptin and resistin of newborn rats were determined by RT-PCR. Histomorphology and parameter of islet and cells were observed by morphometry. Result(s): Compared with controls, the birth weight of rats in ETOH group was decreased significantly (P<0.001); the insulin contents of plasma and pancreas were also decreased (P<0.05), however blood glucose was increased in newborn ethanol rats (P<0.05). Adipose resistin mRNA level was higher (P<0.05), but leptin level was lower (P<0.05) in newborn ethanol rats. Morphology and the amount of islets as well as cell density were normal in newborn ethanol rats (P>0.05). Conclusion(s): Heavy ethanol consumption during pregnancy increase blood glucose level of newborn rats and decrease insulin secretion and adipokines gene linked insulin resistance which may contribute to insulin resistance in adult offspring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Twin pregnancies are characterized by unique pattern of attenuated fetal weight gain during late gestation compared with singleton gestation. The mechanism(s) responsible for regulating twin growth has not yet elucidated. Leptin and adiponectin are two adipocytokines implicated in metabolism and energy balance of fetuses, newborns and adults. Moreover, these hormones have been suggested to play a role in fetal growth. The objective of the study was to determine cord blood adiponectin and leptin in twins and singletons, with and without growth impairment., STUDY DESIGN: This was a case-control study. It included two groups of newborns, matched for gestational age and birth weight percentile: singleton (n=60 newborns) and twins (n=44 newborns). Adiponectin and leptin were determined in cord blood, and compared between the groups according to clinical and demographic characteristics. Non-parametric and parametric statistical methods were employed., RESULTS: Median adiponectin and leptin concentrations were lower in twins vs singletons (P<0.001 for both comparisons). Among small for gestational age newborns (SGA), median concentration of adiponectin (P=0.04), but not leptin (P=0.1), was lower in twins compared to singletons. In pooled analysis (singleton plus twins), cord blood adiponectin and leptin were strongly correlated with gestational age (P<0.001 and P=0.005, respectively) and birth weight (P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). Regression analysis revealed that plurality (P=0.02) was significantly and independently associated with cord blood adiponectin concentrations, after adjustment for confounding variables. Similar regression in which leptin was the independent variable revealed that only birth weight (P=0.01) was significantly and independently associated with cord blood leptin concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: Twin pregnancies are associated with lower cord blood concentrations of adiponectin and leptin compared with singleton gestations. However, only cord blood adiponectin, but not leptin, was lower in SGA neonates. Collectively, these data suggest that adiponectin may be implicated in the mechanism accounting for the growth disparity between twins and singletons.

AB  - Background: Obesity is a major clinical problem. The number of obese pregnant women is rising rapidly. The consequences of obesity are significant and affect every aspect of perinatal care for both the mother and the developing fetus. Adipose tissue may be responsible for chronic subclinical inflammation in obesity, being a source of inflammatory mediators. The study was designed to evaluate the analysis of the serum concentration of inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and adiponectin, in obese pregnant women at full-term pregnancies. Material/Methods: The study included 40 women with body mass index (BMI) less than 30 and 24 pregnant women with BMI equal to or greater than 30, admitted to the Perinatology and Obstetrics Department of the University Hospital in Cracow in the first stage of labor. Blood samples were taken from patients to detect the serum concentration of cytokines. Ultrasound was used to evaluate the development of the fetus, including estimated fetal weight, Doppler flows, and the amount of amniotic fluid. We also included the history of chronic diseases and other complications of the pregnancy. A p-value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: The level of adiponectin in obese patients as compared to controls was significantly lower. There was no statistically significant difference in either group when TNF-alpha and IL-6 were measured. The results of the survey are consistent with previous reports. Conclusions: The exact role of inflammation in pregnancy is not well understood. Determining the exact functions of the different cytokines in physiological pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by obesity requires further study.

AB  - Placental growth hormone (PGH) is secreted from the human placental syncytiotrophoblast into the maternal circulation. PGH levels in pregnant women correlate with the birth weight of their offspring. We hypothesized that metabolic regulators may alter PGH secretion. BeWo cells as human trophoblast models were treated for 24, 48, and 72 h with insulin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, cortisol, ghrelin, leptin and visfatin. Cyclic-adenosinmonophosphate treatment served as positive control. PGH concentrations in culture media were measured. Insulin reduced (p < 0.008; analysis of variance) PGH secretion from BeWo cells after 72 h. No effect was found when treating cells with IGF-1. Cortisol reduced PGH secretion after 48 h (p < 0.00118; analysis of variance) and 72 h (p < 0.015). Leptin and ghrelin both suppressed (p < 0.027 and p < 0.017, paired t test) whereas visfatin increased (p < 0.014, paired t test) PGH secretion at 72 h. Cyclic adenosinmonophosphate increased (p < 0.003) PGH secretion at 72 h. Our results indicate that in vitro PGH secretion by BeWo cells is regulated by hormonal factors and adipokines. We speculate on the existence of a maternal-placental regulatory loop, in which elevated insulin and leptin levels might down-regulate PGH secretion.

AB  - Objective: We investigated the diagnostic value of first-trimester adipokines and placental markers in predicting macrosomia. Methods: Out of 328 women recruited during the prenatal diagnosis between 11th and 13th week of pregnancy and subjected to follow up until delivery, we selected 26 women who gave birth to macrosomic babies and 34 women who gave birth to normal weight neonates for the evaluation of first trimester serum levels of pregnancy associated plasma protein-A, free beta-human chorionic gonadotropin, placental growth factor (PIGF), and selected adipokines. Results: The mothers of macrosomic infants had higher PIGF (p = .049) and irisin concentrations (p = .00003), and lower fetuin-A levels (p = .0002) than had the mothers of normal weight babies. Newborn's weight correlated positively with maternal irisin (R = 0.454, p = .0003) and negatively with fetuin-A concentrations (R = -0.497, p = .00005). Multiple regression analysis showed that only serum irisin concentration was a significant predictor of birth weight (beta = 0.329, p = .03), explaining 14% of its variability. The sensitivity and the specificity of irisin concentration in predicting macrosomia were 0.769 and 0.794, respectively (AUC = 0.818 [95%CI: 0.708-0.928], p = .00001) with a proposed cut-off value of 1725.4 ng/ml. Conclusions: Our results suggest that mother's irisin may be an early biomarker of macrosomia.

AB  - Background: Pregnancy and accelerated fetal growth always are related with major metabolic changes and body fat redistribution and adiponectin is one of principle adipocyte hormones, so studying adiponectin changes during pregnancy may reveal some hidden parts of fetal metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess adiponectin and leptin levels in umbilical cord and maternal serum, their relation with each other and with neonatal weight, birth length and other fetal growth markers. Methods: The study was carried out with 72 appropriate for age newborns (36 female, 36 male) and their mothers. The anthropometric variables of the newborns studied were birth weight, birth length, and birth weigbt/birth length and ponderal index. Maternal and umbilical cord adiponectin and leptin levels were measured by ELISA and compared. Results: The median of cord blood adiponectin concentration were 3 fold higher than those of maternal group. Umbilical cord blood leptin levels were significantly correlated with neonatal birth weight and birth weight/birth length (r= 0.29, P=0.01 and r= 0.24, P= 0.04, respectively). No statistical difference has been demonstrated between both groups of male and female neonates regarding birth weight, birth length, maternal and neonatal leptin levels, ponderal index and maternal and neonatal adiponectin levels. Conclusion: Neonatal leptin is related to birth weight. Adiponectin has no relation with birth weight. Neither leptin nor adiponectin correlated with gender difference.

AB  - Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) dramatically increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in preterm babies, a disease characterized by arrested alveolarization and abnormal microvascular angiogenesis. We have previously described a rodent low protein diet (LPD) model of IUGR inducing impaired alveolarization, but failed to demonstrate any modification of the classical factors involved in lung development. We performed a genome-wide microarray analysis in 120 rat pups with LPD-induced IUGR and their controls, at three key time points of the alveolarization process: postnatal day 4 (P4): start of alveolarization; P10: peak of the alveolarization process and P21: end of the alveolarization process. Results were analysed using Arraymining, DAVID and KEGG software and validated by qRT-PCR and western blots. Considering a cut-off of 2:1 as significant, 67 transcripts at P4, 102 transcripts at P10 and 451 transcripts at P21 were up-regulated, and 89 transcripts at P4, 25 transcripts at P10 and 585 transcripts at P21 were down-regulated. Automatic functional classification identified three main modified pathways, 'cell adhesion molecules', 'cardiac muscle contraction' and 'peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor' (PPAR). Protein analysis confirmed involvement of the PPAR pathway, with an increase of FABP4, an activator of this pathway, at P4 and an increase of adiponectin at P21. Other data also suggest involvement of the PPAR pathway in impaired alveolarization. Our results show that deregulation of the PPAR pathway may be an important component of the mechanism inducing impaired alveolarization observed in IUGR. The complete dataset is available as GEO profiles on the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database ( , GEO Accession No. GSE56956). Copyright (c) 2014 Pathological Society of Great Britain and Ireland.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipose tissue is not only a storage place for fat, but also an endocrine organ, secreting bioactive molecules which influence body metabolism. Such molecules are known as adipocytokines. In the past years the coincidence between adipocytokines and fetal growth restriction disorders was found. The aim of the study was to estimate serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and resistin in children born small for gestational age, compared to children born at an appropriate size for gestational age., METHODS: The study consisted of 35 children aged seven to nine years, born SGA (small for gestational age) on term and 25 healthy children (14 girls, 11 boys), born with proper birthweight (AGA-appropriate for gestational age)-control group., RESULTS: Adiponectin and leptin levels were significantly higher in the SGA group compared to the AGA group (p = 0.023, p = 0.018 respectively). The resistin values were comparable in both groups of patients. There was a positive correlation between serum leptin concentration and current body weight in SGA group (r = 0.28; p = 0.108). In turn, adiponectin levels in this group of patients negatively correlated with actual body weight (r = -0.51; p = 0.002). The negative correlation between body mass index and plasma adiponectin levels was found only in children born SGA. SGA children had significantly higher values of diastolic blood pressure. There was negative correlation between serum adiponectin level and systolic blood pressure in SGA children. In the SGA group the phenomenon of catch-up growth was observed in 32 children., CONCLUSIONS: Children born SGA have abnormal adipose tissue biomarkers profiles.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the glucose-related hormone profile of very low birthweight (VLBW) infants and assess the association between neonatal hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance during the admission period., DESIGN: A prospective observational study-the Very Low Birth Weight Infants, Glucose and Hormonal Profiles over Time study., SETTING: A tertiary neonatal intensive care unit and four neonatal units in county hospitals in Sweden., PATIENTS: 48 infants born <1500 g (VLBW) during 2016-2019., OUTCOME MEASURES: Plasma concentrations of glucose-related hormones and proteins (C-peptide, insulin, ghrelin, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), glucagon, leptin, resistin and proinsulin), insulin:C-peptide and proinsulin:insulin ratios, Homoeostatic Model Assessment 2 (HOMA2) and Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check (QUICKI) indices, measured on day of life (DOL) 7 and at postmenstrual age 36 weeks., RESULTS: Lower gestational age was significantly associated with higher glucose, C-peptide, insulin, proinsulin, leptin, ghrelin, resistin and GLP-1 concentrations, increased HOMA2 index, and decreased QUICKI index and proinsulin:insulin ratio. Hyperglycaemic infants had significantly higher glucose, C-peptide, insulin, leptin and proinsulin concentrations, and lower QUICKI index, than normoglycaemic infants. Higher glucose and proinsulin concentrations and insulin:C-peptide ratio, and lower QUICKI index on DOL 7 were significantly associated with longer duration of hyperglycaemia during the admission period., CONCLUSIONS: VLBW infants seem to have a hormone profile consistent with insulin resistance. Lower gestational age and hyperglycaemia are associated with higher concentrations of insulin resistance markers. Copyright © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024. Re-use permitted under CC BY.

AB  - PURPOSE: Assessing the biochemical markers levels and the uterine artery Doppler (UtA) parameters in fetuses with growth restriction (FGR)., METHODS: Prospective case-control study included 66 patients with diagnosis of FGR and 64 healthy pregnancies at 24-41 weeks of gestation. For both groups, maternal circulating concentrations of biochemical factors of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1), soluble endoglin(sEng), adiponectin, A disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAM-12), pregnancy-associated plasma protein-A (PAPP-A), angiopoietin-2 (ANGI-2), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) were assayed by ELISA and UtA by Doppler were performed. ANOVA, Mann-Whitney tests and Pearson correlation coefficient were applied to compare the biochemical factors, UtA Doppler and EFW Z-score between the groups., RESULTS: Concentrations of sFlt-1, sEng, PAPP-A were significantly higher in FGR than controls (p < 0.0001, p = 0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively), but concentration of ANGI-2 (p < 0.0001) was significantly lower in FGR than controls and ADAM-12 levels had a tendency to be lower in the FGR, though not statistically significant (p = 0.059). Increased sEng concentrations were correlated with abnormal UtA Doppler in FGR., CONCLUSION: Fetal growth restriction fetuses showed increased serum levels of sFlt-1, sEng and PAPP-A with levels of ANGI-2 decreased and a positive association between elevated concentrations of sEng and changing impedance of UtA Doppler were observed.

AB  - Recent epidemiology demonstrates higher rate of obesity and metabolic syndrome in offspring with undernutrition in utero. IUGR babies with intrauterine undernutrition grow rapidly to catch up with normal growth course. Leptin is an adipocyte derived satiety factor that regulates food intake and energy expenditure. We demonstrated in mice model with maternal food restriction during pregnancy that premature leptin surge during neonatal catch up growth of the offspring lead them to impaired leptin sensitivity and obesity in adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adverse metabolic outcomes later in life have been reported among children or young adults who were born as preterm infants. This study was conducted to examine the impact of very preterm/very low birth weight (VP/VLBW) birth and subsequent growth after hospital discharge on cardiometabolic outcomes such as insulin resistance, fasting glucose, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) among children at 6-8 years of age., METHODS: This retrospective cohort study included children aged 6-8 years and compared those who were born at < 32 weeks of gestation or weighing < 1,500 g at birth (n = 60) with those born at term (n = 110). Body size, fat mass, BP, glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and lipid profiles were measured. Weight-for-age z-score changes between discharge and early school-age period were also calculated, and factors associated with BP, fasting glucose, and insulin resistance were analyzed., RESULTS: Children who were born VP/VLBW had significantly lower fat masses, higher systolic BP and diastolic BP, and significantly higher values of fasting glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), compared to children born at term. VP/VLBW was correlated with HOMA-IR and BPs after adjusting for various factors, including fat mass index and weight-for-age z-score changes. Weight-for-age z-score changes were associated with HOMA-IR, but not with BPs., CONCLUSIONS: Although children aged 6-8 years who were born VP/VLBW showed significantly lower weight and fat mass, they had significantly higher BPs, fasting glucose, HOMA-IR, and leptin levels. The associations of VP/VLBW with cardiometabolic factors were independent of fat mass and weight gain velocity. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - Objective: We aimed to investigate the effects of early high-protein supplementation on low birth weight (LBW)-associated adult metabolic disturbances. Materials and Methods: This study involved 32 LBW rat pups that were fed a normal protein (20% of energy intake) diet or high-protein (30% of energy intake) diet on their first 4 weeks of life. Sixteen rat pups with normal birth weight (NBW) fed the normal-protein diet were included as control. Biochemical measurements were performed at 4 and 12 weeks of age. Results: Low birth weight offspring showed significantly (P < 0.05) increased fat mass percentage and adipocyte size and decreased lean mass percentage and muscle fiber size relative to NBW offspring. These LBW-related changes in body composition were corrected by high-protein diet intervention. At 12 weeks of age, the fasting insulin level (7.14 +/- 0.83 vs 9.27 +/- 0.67 mU/L) and homeostasis model of insulin resistance (1.71 +/- 0.35 vs 2.30 +/- 0.44) were significantly lower in high protein-fed LBW offspring than in normal protein-fed LBW offspring. Low birth weight rat pups showed a significant (P G 0.05) reduction in serum adiponectin concentrations, glucose transporter 4 mRNA abundance, and phosphorylation levels of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) relative to NBW controls. These LBW-associated alterations in gene expression were reversed by early high-protein treatment. Conclusions: Early postnatal high-protein intake alters the body composition and improves insulin resistance in adults with LBW, which is associated with activation of the AMPK and mTOR pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differences in umbilical venous and arterial leptin levels by mode of delivery., METHODS: Subjects were 30 mothers who had elective cesarean deliveries and 34 mothers who had vaginal deliveries. Umbilical venous and arterial leptin levels were measured immediately after delivery. Maternal age, neonatal gender, neonatal birth weight, placental weight, and gestational duration were recorded. Inter- and intragroup comparisons were made in umbilical venous and arterial leptin levels and obstetric variables. Significant determinants of differences in umbilical venous and arterial leptin levels were investigated., RESULTS: Umbilical venous and arterial leptin levels were higher in the vaginal delivery group (n = 34) than in the cesarean group (n = 30) (P <.01). In the vaginal delivery group, umbilical venous leptin levels were significantly higher than arterial leptin levels (P <.001). These differences were still significant after adjustment for neonatal gender, neonatal birth weight, and placental weight. However, in the cesarean group, leptin levels did not differ between umbilical vein and artery., CONCLUSION: Placental leptin release is augumented during advanced labor.

AB  - AIMS/INTRODUCTION: Gene-environment interactions are considered to critically influence type 2 diabetes mellitus development; however, the underlying mechanisms and specific interactions remain unclear. Given the increasing prevalence of low birthweight (LBW) influenced by the intrauterine environment, we sought to investigate genetic factors related to type 2 diabetes development in individuals with LBW., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The interaction between 20 reported type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes and the development of type 2 diabetes in LBW (<2,500 g) individuals in a population-based Japanese cohort (n = 1,021) was examined by logistic regression and stratified analyses., RESULTS: Logistic regression analyses showed that only the G/G genotype at the rs1862513 locus of the resistin gene (RETN), an established initiator of insulin resistance, was closely related to the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in individuals with LBW. Age, sex and current body mass index-adjusted stratified analyses showed a significant interaction effect of LBW and the RETN G/G genotype on fasting insulin, homeostatic model assessment 2-insulin resistance, Matsuda index and the prevalence of type 2 diabetes (all P-values for interaction <0.05). The adjusted odds ratio for type 2 diabetes in the LBW + G/G genotype group was 7.33 (95% confidence interval 2.43-22.11; P = 0.002) compared with the non-LBW + non-G/G genotype group. Similar results were obtained after excluding the influence of malnutrition due to World War II., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous assessment of LBW and the RETN G/G genotype can more accurately predict the risk of future type 2 diabetes than assessing each of these factors alone, and provide management strategies, including early lifestyle intervention in LBW population.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extra-uterine growth retardation (EUGR) is associated with an increased risk for cardiometabolic diseases later in life. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between early weight change after birth in preterm infants and adiponectin (adn) multimeric complexes., METHODS: Subjects included 28 preterm infants born between weeks 24 and 33 of gestation. Serum adn multimeric complexes and the anthropometric parameters were measured in preterm infants at birth and at corrected term., RESULTS: Bodyweight (BW) decreased during the first week of life, with birthweight restored at approximately 19 days after birth. Nineteen of the subjects had EUGR at corrected term. Total (T)-adn, high-molecular-weight (H)-adn, and the ratio of H-adn to T-adn (H/T-adn) were significantly elevated at corrected term than at birth. Postmenstrual age, birthweight, birth length and lowest BW after birth were positively correlated with H-adn and H/T-adn. Weight reduction after birth was negatively correlated with H-adn. Age to restore birthweight was negatively correlated with T-adn, H-adn and H/T-adn. Stepwise multiple regression analysis indicated age to restore birthweight as the major predictor of T-adn and H-adn., DISCUSSION: Early weight changes after birth may alter serum adn level in preterm infants at corrected term. The appropriate nutritional support in the early postnatal period could reduce the prevalence of EUGR and the future risk for cardiometabolic diseases. Copyright © 2011 The Authors.

AB  - Adiponectin consists of three subspecies (high-, middle- and low-molecular weight adiponectin). Among these, high-molecular weight adiponectin (H-adn) is suggested to be an active form of this protein. To assess the relationship between H-adn and postnatal growth in preterm infants (PIs), serum H-adn and total adiponectin (T-adn) were measured in 46 Pis at birth and at corrected term, and 26 term infants (TI) at birth. T-adn and H-adn concentrations, and the ratio of H-adn to T-adn (H/T-adn) were significantly greater in TI and PI at corrected term than in PI at birth (p < 0.001). T-adn and H-adn concentrations in PI at corrected term were similar to those in TI, but H/T-adn in PI at corrected term was less than that in TI (p < 0.02). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that the factors contributing to H/T-adn and serum concentrations of T- and H-adn in PI at corrected term were different from those in TI. These data suggest that quality of early postnatal growth in Pis is different from that in normally developed TI. Postnatal growth accompanying adipose tissue similar to TI may be important for PI to prevent future development of cardiovascular disease. (Pediatr Res 65: 580-583, 2009)

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) levels in the serum and term placentas and its potential role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., METHODS: A total of 49 GDM subjects and 39 age-matched women with normal pregnancies were recruited. We examined serum concentrations of NGAL and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in maternal blood and cord blood and their expression levels in the term placentas and umbilical cord., RESULTS: Serum NGAL levels were significantly higher in GDM patients than in normal pregnant controls both in the maternal blood (4.80 +/- 1.99 vs. 3.66 +/- 1.13, P=0.001) and the cord blood (4.70 +/- 2.08 vs. 3.85 +/- 1.44, P=0.027). Moreover, serum NGAL levels exhibited a positive correlation with various parameters of insulin resistance. Maternal serum NGAL levels positively correlated with the NGAL levels found in the cord blood of the control (r = 0.399, P=0.012) and the GDM subjects (r = 0.349, P=0.014). Finally, the expression of NGAL protein levels in the placenta (1.22 +/- 0.39 vs. 0.65 +/- 0.23, P < 0.001) and umbilical cord (0.65 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.25 +/- 0.10, P < 0.001) were higher in GDM women than those noted in the control subjects. In the GDM group, maternal serum NGAL levels exhibited a positive correlation with placental NGAL mRNA and protein levels (r = 0.848, P=0.008; r = 0.636, P=0.011, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: NGAL may be an important adipokine involved in GDM and fetal development. The oversecretion of NGAL from the placenta may contribute to the elevated levels of serum NGAL in gestational diabetes mellitus. Copyright © 2020 Xiaoqian Yin et al.

AB  - Overnutrition during the perinatal period has been associated with susceptibility to obesity and related comorbidities. We examined the effects of postnatal early overnutrition on the development of juvenile obesity and the associated renal pathophysiological changes. Three or 10 pups per mother from rat pup litters were assigned to either the overnutrition or control groups during the first 21 days of life. The effects of overfeeding were measured at 28 days. The smaller male litter pups were heavier than the controls between 4 and 28 days after birth (P<.05). By 28 days of age, the kidney weight per body weight ratio decreased in the small litter group (P<.05). Circulating leptin levels increased in the small litter rats (P<.05). Overnutrition had no effect on renal cell proliferation, apoptosis, macrophages and glomerulosclerosis. In the immunoblots and immunohistochemistry, renin and angiotensin II type (AT) 2 receptor expression increased in the overfed rats (P<.05). By contrast, the plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression decreased in the overnutrition group (P<.05). The AT 1 receptor, tissue inhibitor of MMP-1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, tumor necrosis factor-a, osteopontin and adiponectin expression was not changed. Our data showed that postnatal early overfeeding led to hyperleptinemia, juvenile obesity and the acquired reset of renal maturation. Up-regulation of renin and AT2 and down-regulation of PAI-1 and MMP-9 might contribute to abnormal programming of renal growth in rats exposed to postnatal early overnutrition. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background/aims: Adipocytokines play a role in intrauterine growth but the effects of the nutrition education on adipocytokines and physical measurements at birth remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of nutrition education on adipocytokines levels in cord blood and physical measurements at birth. Method(s): The present study involved 52 pregnant women who were in pregnancy followed up in Gazi University Medical School Hospital at Ankara, Turkey. They were randomly divided into two groups and experimental group involved in nutrition education. Result(s): There was a positive association between the cord blood leptin values of the both groups. Nutrition education had no significant effect on cord blood adiponectin, visfatin and IL-6 values of the newborns. Also there was not a significant difference between the average values of weight and the head circumference of newborns in both groups. In experimental group, the average birth length was observed to be higher than that of control group. Conclusion(s): Nutrition education might improve leptin levels of the newborns in the experimental group. In the lights of these results, it may be suggested that higher cord blood leptin levels could play an important role in higher birth length values of the newborns.Copyright © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - Leptin, the ob gene product, plays an important role in the regulation of body fat mass and weight. In previous studies, it was demonstrated that leptin is detectable in human fetal cord blood as early as at 18 weeks of gestation and that serum leptin concentrations are significantly reduced in small gestational age newborns. In the present study, we investigated whether umbilical and maternal serum leptin concentrations correlate with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). In addition, we aimed to determine the relationships between leptin concentration in the maternal and cord blood. We studied 40 newborn infants (21 female and 19 male; gestational age, 38-42 weeks) and their mothers. Of the infants studied, 10 had IUGR. Serum leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. All newborns had detectable leptin concentrations. Leptin concentrations were significantly lower in newborns with IUGR and in their mothers (n = 10; 3.53 +/- 1.42 ng/ml, 6.75 +/- 1.47 ng/ml, respectively) than in infants experiencing normal growth and their mothers (n = 30; 5.58 +/- 2.98 ng/ml, 9.85 +/- 6.50 ng/ml, respectively) (p < 0.01 for newborns, p < 0.05 for mothers). There was no significant correlation between umbilical leptin concentration and maternal leptin concentration (r = 0.229; p = 0.155) in all study groups but, significantly, a correlation was observed in the group with IUGR (r = 0.736; p = 0.015). There were no significant correlations between both umbilical and maternal leptin concentrations and parity, delivery type and gestational age. There was a correlation between umbilical leptin concentration and birth weight of newborns (r = 0.383; p = 0.015) but no correlation with body mass index (BMI) of the newborns (r = 0.034; p = 0.834). Maternal leptin concentrations correlated with maternal weight and BMI (r=0.606; p=0.000, r=0.535; p=0.000, respectively). There was no correlation between maternal leptin concentrations and birth weight of the newborns (r=0.179; p=0.269) and with BMI of the newborns (r = 0.146; p = 0.367). There was no gender difference in leptin concentrations in the newborns (n=21; 5.50 +/- 3.37 ng/ml, for females; n = 19; 4.58 +/- 1.98 ng/ml for males) (p = 0.296). In summary, we have shown that IUGR is associated with a decreased leptin concentration in newborns and their mothers. The association between umbilical serum leptin and birth weight in this and other studies suggests a pivotal role of fetal leptin in regulating fetal growth and development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While adipokines can regulate satiety and energy metabolism, whether they are associated with childhood growth is unclear., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether adipokine levels at birth are associated with growth., METHODS: A total of 2264 singletons and 1144 twins from Upstate KIDS (born 2008-2010) had adiponectin, leptin, resistin and complement factor D measured in newborn blood spots. Parents reported anthropometry from paediatric visits via questionnaires every 4-6 months. Generalized linear mixed effects models were used to estimate growth trajectories through 3 years of age., RESULTS: Among singletons, resistin and leptin were associated with greater weight-for-age (0.12 z-score units (95%CI: 0.04, 0.20) [p = 0.003] and 0.15 (0.06, 0.24) [p = 0.001], respectively) and BMI z-score (0.11; 0.02, 0.20 [p = 0.02] and 0.18; 0.07, 0.28 [p = 0.002], respectively). After adjusting for birthweight, resistin and a ratio of resistin-to-adiponectin remained associated with weight through 3 years of age and odds of being overweight at 3 years of age in a subgroup of singletons. Among twins, adiponectin was associated with increased weight-for-age and length-for-age z-scores even after adjusting for birthweight (0.18; 0.08, 0.28 [p = 0.0006]; 0.20; 0.07, 0.33 [p = 0.003], respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of adipokines were associated with early childhood growth in small magnitudes. Resistin may be relevant for further examination in paediatric obesity. Copyright © 2018 World Obesity Federation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipokines can serve as a measure of adipose tissue activity. Although birthweight correlates with neonatal adiposity, findings for cord blood levels of adipokines and birth outcomes have been conflicted. Therefore, we determined the cross-sectional associations between adipokines measured in newborn dried blood spots (DBS) and birth outcomes., METHODS: The Upstate KIDS study enrolled mothers and infants from 2008 to 2010. Among infants whose parents consented to the use of residual DBS from newborn screening, 2397 singletons and 1240 twins had adipokine measurements from the Human Obesity Panel (R&D Systems) by Luminex. Odds ratios were estimated by multivariable logistic regression for risk of birth outcomes of preterm delivery (<37 weeks for singletons, <32 for twins) and small-for-gestational age (SGA <10th for singletons and <3rd for twins age- and sex-specific percentiles) by adipokine quintiles. Generalised estimating equations were applied to account for correlations between twins., RESULTS: Singletons in the lowest compared with the highest quintile of adiponectin were more likely preterm (adjusted odds ratio 3.26; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99, 5.34) and SGA (1.81; [95% CI 1.18, 2.77]). Similar associations were observed among twins. Resistin was associated with preterm birth (Q1 vs. Q5: 2.08; [95% CI 1.20, 3.62]) only among singletons. Adipsin had inconsistent associations after adjustment., CONCLUSIONS: This large population-based study demonstrates that newborn DBS-measured adipokines are associated with birth outcomes, particularly preterm birth and SGA among those with lower adiponectin levels regardless of plurality.

AB  - The leptin to fat ratio early in life could contribute to fixing the set point of leptin feedback at the hypothalamic level. Subjects from Asian and Caucasian ethnicities differ in body composition. We tested the hypothesis that anthropometric markers and their relationship to umbilical cord leptin, cortisol and cortisone, DHEAs and oestriol differed between Caucasians and Asians at birth. Birthweight, length, arm, calf and abdominal circumferences, scapular, triceps, quadriceps and abdominal skinfolds were measured in 180 healthy, full-term newborns of Asian and Caucasian ethnicities. Leptin and steroid hormone concentrations were determined in umbilical cord plasma. There was a significant difference in the slope of the regression between leptin and birthweight (p = 0.03) and calf circumference (p = 0.05) between male Caucasian and Asian neonates. In contrast, in female neonates, there was no significant difference (p = 0.099 and p = 0.07 for birthweight and calf circumference, respectively). In addition, while the slopes of the regression plots were not affected by gender in Asian newborns, there was a significant difference between male and female Caucasian newborns (p = 0.006 and p = 0.002 for birthweight and calf circumference, respectively). There was no significant correlation between cord leptin concentrations or anthropometric markers and steroid hormone concentrations. In conclusion, gender and ethnic differences in the relationship between leptin and anthropometric markers are detectable at birth between Asians and Caucasians, two ethnic groups that have been demonstrated to have different body compositions later in life. This may represent the first clinical evidence of a difference in leptin regulation between these two ethnic groups.

AB  - Subfatin and spexin are two novel adipokines implicated in glucose homeostasis. This study was designed to investigate changes in blood subfatin and spexin levels during gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and childbirth, and define the mechanisms of these hormones in the physiopathology of GDM. A total of 60 pregnant women, comprising 30 diagnosed with GDM and 30 with normal gestation, were included in the study. The diagnosis of GDM was made through a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) administered between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. The amounts of subfatin, spexin, and insulin were measured in blood samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays; lipid profiles, glucose, and other biochemical parameters were measured by using an autoanalyzer. Levels of subfatin and spexin were significantly higher in blood samples drawn at baseline (before OGTT) in mothers with GDM compared to those with normal gestation. Similar observations were made in maternal and cord blood sampled at the end of pregnancy. However, at delivery, the increase in subfatin and spexin concentrations observed at baseline was abrogated in both groups of pregnant women, although levels in mothers with GDM were comparatively higher. These results show that levels of subfatin and spexin increased because of GDM and suggest that these hormones could be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and management of GDM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are still controversies whether insulin resistance (IR) develops in preterm born children during early childhood., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), adiponectin, visfatin and insulin sensitivity in the pathogenesis of possible IR in preterm born children during early childhood., PATIENTS AND METODS: Twenty-nine preterm small for gestational age (SGA) born children (Group 1) and 25 preterm appropriate for gestational age (AGA) born children (Group 2), matched for gestational age and sex were included in the study. Mean chronological age at investigation was 3.3+/-0.7years and not different between the groups. Blood samples for fasting blood glucose, insulin, proinsulin, adiponectin, leptin, sOB-R and visfatin were obtained., RESULTS: Mean height and weight standard deviation scores (SDS) at investigation were significantly lower in Group 1 than in Group 2, but there was no significant difference in body mass index (BMI) SDS between the groups. Catch-up growth (CUG) was higher in Group 1 than in Group 2. There was no difference regarding homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR), leptin, sOB-R, adiponectin, proinsulin and visfatin values between the groups. In the whole group, log visfatin showed a negative correlation with DELTAweight SDS. There was a positive correlation between HOMA-IR and BMI SDS. Adiponectin levels showed a positive correlation with log visfatin levels in all groups., CONCLUSION: Preterm born children whether AGA or SGA do not show IR in early childhood if BMI is normal. Significant differences between the preterm SGA and preterm AGA groups regarding the adipocytokine levels were not detected. Crown Copyright © 2013. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Bifidobacterium, a common probiotic, is widely used in the food industry. Hyperglycemia in pregnancy has become a common disease that impairs the health of the mother and can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, macrosomia, fetal hyperinsulinemia, and perinatal death. Currently, Bifidobacterium has been shown to have the potential to mitigate glycolipid derangements. Therefore, the use of Bifidobacterium-based probiotics to interfere with hyperglycemia in pregnancy may be a promising therapeutic option. We aimed to determine the potential effects of Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis J-12 (J-12) in high-fat diet (HFD)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rats with hyperglycemia in pregnancy (HIP) and respective fetuses. We observed that J-12 or insulin alone failed to significantly improve the fasting blood glucose (FBG) level and oral glucose tolerance; however, combining J-12 and insulin significantly reduced the FBG level during late pregnancy. Moreover, J-12 significantly decreased triglycerides and total cholesterol, relieved insulin and leptin resistance, activated adiponectin, and restored the morphology of the maternal pancreas and hepatic tissue of HIP-induced rats. Notably, J-12 ingestion ameliorated fetal physiological parameters and skeletal abnormalities. HIP-induced cardiac, renal, and hepatic damage in fetuses was significantly alleviated in the J-12-alone intake group, and it downregulated hippocampal mRNA expression of insulin receptor (InsR) and insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R) and upregulated AKT mRNA on postnatal day 0, indicating that J-12 improved fetal neurological health. Furthermore, placental tissue damage in rats with HIP appeared to be in remission in the J-12 group. Upon exploring specific placental microbiota, we observed that J-12 affected the abundance of nine genera, positively correlating with FBG and leptin in rats and hippocampal mRNA levels of InsR and IGF-1R mRNA in the fetus, while negatively correlating with adiponectin in rats and hippocampal levels of AKT in the fetus. These results suggest that J-12 may affect the development of the fetal central nervous system by mediating placental microbiota via the regulation of maternal-related indicators. J-12 is a promising strategy for improving HIP and pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) has been implicated in glucose homeostasis. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) enhances fetal insulin secretion and fetal growth. Girls weigh less and are more insulin resistant than boys at birth. We sought to assess whether FGF19 is associated with GDM and fetal growth and explore potential sex dimorphic associations. This was a nested case-control study in the Shanghai Birth Cohort, including 153 pairs of newborns of GDM versus euglycemic mothers matched by infant's sex and gestational age at birth. Cord plasma FGF19, insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations were measured. Cord plasma FGF19 concentrations were similar in GDM versus euglycemic pregnancies (mean +/- SD: 43.5 +/- 28.2 versus 44.5 +/- 30.2 pg/mL, P=0.38). FGF19 was not correlated with IGF-I or IGF-II. FGF19 concentrations were positively correlated with birth weight (r=0.23, P=0.01) and length (r=0.21, P=0.02) z scores, C-peptide (r=0.27, P=0.002) and proinsulin (r=0.27, P=0.002) concentrations in females. Each SD increment in cord plasma FGF19 was associated with a 0.25 (0.07-0.43) increase in birth weight z score in females. In contrast, FGF19 was not correlated with birth weight or length in males. These sex dimorphic associations remained after adjusting for maternal and neonatal characteristics. The study is the first to demonstrate that GDM does not matter for cord blood FGF19 concentrations. The female specific positive correlation between FGF19 and birth weight is suggestive of a sex-dimorphic role of FGF19 in fetal growth. The observations call for more studies to validate the novel findings and elucidate the underlying mechanisms.Copyright © 2022 Yang, Huang, Liu, Xu, Wang, He, Zhang, Zheng, Fang, Fan, Li, Zhang, Li, Ouyang and Luo.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal overgrowth "programs" an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Epigenetic alterations may be a mechanism in programming the vulnerability. We sought to characterize genome-wide alterations in placental gene methylations in fetal overgrowth and the associations with metabolic health biomarkers including leptin, adiponectin and fetal growth factors., RESULTS: Comparing genome-wide placental gene DNA methylations in large-for-gestational-age (LGA, an indicator of fetal overgrowth, n = 30) versus optimal-for-gestational-age (OGA, control, n = 30) infants using the Illumina Infinium Human Methylation-EPIC BeadChip, we identified 543 differential methylation positions (DMPs; 397 hypermethylated, 146 hypomethylated) at false discovery rate < 5% and absolute methylation difference > 0.05 after adjusting for placental cell-type heterogeneity, maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI and HbA1c levels during pregnancy. Twenty-five DMPs annotated to 20 genes (QSOX1, FCHSD2, LOC101928162, ADGRB3, GCNT1, TAP1, MYO16, NAV1, ATP8A2, LBXCOR1, EN2, INCA1, CAMTA2, SORCS2, SLC4A4, RPA3, UMAD1,USP53, OR2L13 and NR3C2) could explain 80% of the birth weight variations. Pathway analyses did not detect any statistically significant pathways after correcting for multiple tests. We validated a newly discovered differentially (hyper-)methylated gene-visual system homeobox 1 (VSX1) in an independent pyrosequencing study sample (LGA 47, OGA 47). Our data confirmed a hypermethylated gene-cadherin 13 (CDH13) reported in a previous epigenome-wide association study. Adiponectin in cord blood was correlated with its gene methylation in the placenta, while leptin and fetal growth factors (insulin, IGF-1, IGF-2) were not., CONCLUSIONS: Fetal overgrowth may be associated with a large number of altered placental gene methylations. Placental VSX1 and CDH13 genes are hypermethylated in fetal overgrowth. Placental ADIPOQ gene methylations and fetal circulating adiponectin levels were correlated, suggesting the contribution of placenta-originated adiponectin to cord blood adiponectin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP-4) is an adipokine involved in regulating insulin sensitivity which would affect fetal growth. It is unclear whether RBP-4 is associated with fetal overgrowth, and unexplored which fetal growth factor(s) may mediate the association., METHODS: In the Shanghai Birth Cohort, we studied 125 pairs of larger-for-gestational-age (LGA, birth weight >90th percentile, an indicator of fetal overgrowth) and optimal-for-gestational-age (OGA, 25-75th percentiles) control infants matched by sex and gestational age. We measured cord blood concentrations of RBP-4, insulin, proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), and IGF-II., RESULTS: Cord blood RBP-4 concentrations were elevated in LGA vs. OGA infants (21.9 +/- 6.2 vs. 20.2 +/- 5.1 microg/ml, P = 0.011), and positively correlated with birth weight z score (r = 0.19, P = 0.003), cord blood proinsulin (r = 0.21, P < 0.001), IGF-I (r = 0.24, P < 0.001), and IGF-II (r = 0.15, P = 0.016). Adjusting for maternal and neonatal characteristics, each SD increment in cord blood RBP-4 was associated with a 0.28 (0.12-0.45) increase in birth weight z score (P < 0.001). Mediation analyses showed that IGF-I could account for 31.7% of the variation in birth weight z score in association with RBP-4 (P = 0.01), while IGF-II was not an effect mediator., CONCLUSIONS: RBP-4 was positively associated with fetal overgrowth. IGF-I (but not IGF-II) may mediate this association.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gestational diabetes (GD) is associated with impaired insulin sensitivity in newborns. Adiponectin and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP-4) are involved in regulating insulin sensitivity. Females are more likely to develop diabetes at young ages than males. We tested the hypothesis that GD may affect RBP-4 and adiponectin levels in early life, and there may be sex-dimorphic associations., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In a nested case-control study of 153 matched pairs of neonates of mothers with GD and euglycemic pregnancies in the Shanghai Birth Cohort, we evaluated cord plasma leptin, high molecular weight (HMW) and total adiponectin and RBP-4 concentrations., RESULTS: Comparing GD versus euglycemic pregnancies adjusted for maternal and neonatal characteristics in female newborns, cord plasma total adiponectin (mean+/-SD: 30.8+/-14.3 vs 37.1+/-16.1 microg/mL, p=0.048) and HMW adiponectin (14.6+/-7.7 vs 19.3+/-8.3 microg/mL, p=0.004) concentrations were lower, while RBP-4 concentrations were higher (21.7+/-5.4 vs 20.0+/-4.8 microg/mL, p=0.007). In contrast, there were no differences in male newborns (all p>0.2). RBP-4 concentrations were higher in female versus male newborns (21.7+/-5.4 vs 18.8+/-4.5 microg/mL, p<0.001) in GD pregnancies only. HMW adiponectin concentrations were significantly higher in female versus male newborns in euglycemic pregnancies only (19.3+/-8.3 vs 16.1+/-7.4 microg/mL, p=0.014)., CONCLUSIONS: GD was associated with lower cord plasma HMW adiponectin and higher RBP-4 concentrations in female newborns only. The study is the first to reveal a sex-dimorphic early life impact of GD on metabolic health biomarkers in the offspring. GD may alter the normal presence (HMW adiponectin) or absence (RBP-4) of sex dimorphism in some insulin sensitivity regulation-relevant adipokines in early life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between serum leptin levels in the umbilical vein (UV) and artery (UA) and the anthropometry of mothers and neonates., STUDY DESIGN: Blood was taken from 61 pregnant women who were admitted for delivery and from the umbilical vein and artery just before delivery of the placenta. Leptin level was measured by immunoradiometric assay. Comparisons between serum leptin concentrations in UVs and both maternal and neonatal anthropometry were made according to neonatal sex., RESULTS: Mean leptin UA and UV concentrations in female infants were significantly higher than those in male infants (both, P = .002). Leptin concentrations in UVs of the total infants were related to maternal body weight and body mass index preconceptionally as well as at birth, to neonatal birth weight, to gestational age, to Kaup index and to body fat content of the infants., CONCLUSION: A sex difference was observed not only in serum leptin concentrations UA and UV but also in the degree of significance between the relationship of cord leptin and both maternal and neonatal anthropometry. Also, the UA leptin level had a closer relationship to neonatal anthropometry, but the UV leptin level was more closely related to maternal anthropometry.

AB  - In humans, serum levels of leptin correlate with total body fat in both adults and children. After collecting cord blood from 156 term neonates (82 males, 74 females; 132 AGA and 22 LGA), we measured the cord levels of leptin, insulin and IGF-I to determine the relationships between these three hormones and relationships of these hormones with birth size (birth weight and ponderal index for adiposity in newborn) and gender. The leptin and IGF-I levels were significantly higher in the LGA group (9.2+/-4.0 ng/ml and 96.1+/-34.1 ng/ml, respectively) than in the AGA group (4.8+/-3.8 ng/ml and 56.4+/-37.6 ng/ml, respectively). A significant positive correlation was observed between leptin levels and birth weight, and a weaker correlation between leptin levels and birth height. IGF-I level significantly correlated with birth weight and birth height, but there was no correlation between the levels of insulin and birth weight. There was no relationship between the levels of IGF-I, insulin and leptin. Ponderal index was higher in LGA than in AGA. A significant correlation was also observed between the levels of leptin and ponderal index, but not between the levels of insulin or IGF-I and ponderal index. The levels of leptin and ponderal index were higher in females than males despite no gender differences in gestational age and birth weight. In conclusion, our results suggest that the level of IGF-I is a useful index for fetal growth during late gestation, and the development of adipose tissue is the major determinant of fetal serum leptin levels, the production of which is not regulated by insulin or IGF-I. In addition, a gender difference with a higher level of leptin in female neonates suggests that sexual dimorphism in adipose tissue already exists in utero.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) results from an interaction between susceptibility genes and the diabetogenic effects of pregnancy. During pregnancy, mice heterozygous for the lepin receptor (db/+) gain more weight, are glucose intolerant, and produce macrosomic fetuses compared with wild-type (+/+) mothers, suggesting that an alteration in leptin action may play a role in GDM and fetal overgrowth. To investigate whether leptin administration or pair-feeding can reduce adiposity and thereby prevent GDM and neonatal overgrowth, we examined energy balance, glucose and insulin tolerance, and fetal growth in pregnant db/+ and +/+ mice treated with recombinant human leptin-IgG during late pregnancy. Leptin reduced food intake and adiposity in pregnant db/+ mice to levels similar to pregnant +/+ mice and significantly reduced maternal weight gain. Maternal glucose levels were markedly lower during glucose and insulin challenge tests in leptin-treated db/+ mice relative to db/+ and pair-fed controls. Despite reduced energy intake and improved glucose tolerance, leptin administration did not reduce fetal overgrowth in offspring from db/+ mothers. Fetal and placental leptin levels were 1.3- to 1.5-fold higher in offspring from db/+ mothers and remained unchanged with leptin administration, whereas leptin treatment in +/+ mothers or pair-feeding decreased placental leptin concentration and reduced fetal birth weight. Our results provide evidence that leptin administration during late gestation can reduce adiposity and improve glucose tolerance in the db/+ mouse model of spontaneous GDM. However, fetal and placenta leptin levels are higher in db/+ mothers and are subject to reduced negative feedback in response to leptin treatment. These data suggest that alterations in placenta leptin may contribute to the regulation of fetal growth independently of maternal glucose levels.

AB  - Recently it has become clear that adiponectin and leptin are related to metabolic syndrome-linked diseases. To clarify the roles of serum adiponectin and leptin levels in mothers and neonates, we investigated the concentration of total, high, middle and low moleculer weight adiponectin (T-Ad, HMW-Ad, MMW-Ad, LMW-Ad, respectively) and leptin serum levels in mothers and umbilical cord blood. Adiponectin and leptin in umbilical cord blood were measured in term singleton deliveries (n=74). We determined serum concentrations of each adiponectin isoform and leptin by using a newly developed enzyme immunosorbent assay. T-Ad, HMW-Ad and leptin levels in umbilical cord blood were significantly higher than those in mothers. The ratio of HMW-Ad to T-Ad was also significantly higher in umbilical cord blood. We found the differences in adiponectin and leptin levels between caesarean section cases and vaginal delivery cases. We also found statiscal relationships between adiponectin and leptin levels and BMI of mothers, gestational age, birth weight and placenta weight. Furthermore, it is likely that real time PCR results indicate that the main production source of adiponectin is not the placenta but the fetus itself. The role of adiponectin and leptin during pregnancy and postnatal life should be further explored.

AB  - Maternal exposure to overnutrition during fetal development contributes to metabolic and renal damage in offspring. Adiponectin plays a protective role against obesity-related renal injury. However, role of adiponectin in renal injury of offspring exposed to maternal overnutrition remains unknown. We addressed the issue. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either a standard (N) or a high-fat and high-fructose (HFF)-diet for 6 weeks before mating, and kept each diet during the gestation and lactation period. After 4 weeks postpartum, all the offspring were fed N diet, and followed by 12 weeks. Kidney weight, urinary albumin excretion, blood pressure, and blood chemistry, including adiponectin and malondialdehyde, a marker of oxidative stress, were evaluated in the offspring. Compared with N-offspring, serum adiponectin levels of 1-day- and 4-week-old HFF-offspring were significantly lower, the latter of which was inversely associated with malondialdehyde. Kidney weight was significantly decreased in 1-day-old HFF-offspring, whereas increased in 4-week-old HFF-offspring. Urinary albumin excretion levels of HFF-offspring at 8, 12, and 16-week old were significantly higher than those of N-offspring at the same age, whose levels at 16-week old were inversely correlated with plasma adiponectin. Compared with N-offspring, HFF-offspring at 16-week old exhibited glomerulosclerosis, hyperglycemia, and high mean blood pressure associated with reduced podocin and increased transforming growth factor-beta 1 expression in the kidneys. Our present study suggests that exposure to maternal HFF-diet during fetal and early postnatal development induces hypoadiponectinemia in offspring, which might cause renal injury and metabolic derangements later in life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Asprosin is a newly identified adipokine that is expressed in the placenta. Its production is increased in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and it is a factor related to insulin resistance. This study aimed to determine whether neonatal serum asprosin levels are associated with anthropometric characteristics of newborns born to mothers with and without GDM., METHODS: This study included 51 newborns of mothers with GDM (insulin-treated or diet-treated) and 55 control newborns with their mothers. In newborns, anthropometric parameters were measured, and the concentrations of asprosin were detected by ELISA. Maternal blood glucose levels, body weight, and length were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated., RESULTS: Serum asprosin levels were significantly higher and linked to a higher risk in the newborns of mothers with GDM compared with those of the control newborns (170.3 [132.6] vs. 91.4 [68.7] ng/mL, p < 0.001). Serum asprosin levels were negatively correlated with blood glucose concentrations (r = -0.282, p = 0.045) in the newborns of mothers with GDM and significantly positively correlated with birth weight (r = 0.315, p = 0.019) in the control newborns. Newborn serum asprosin levels were positively correlated with the glucose levels (r = 0.264, p = 0.006) of all mothers. In addition, newborns born to an insulin-treated mother with GDM had significantly higher birth weight and length than newborns born to a diet-treated mother with GDM (3262.9 vs. 3137 g, p = 0.032, and 49.7 vs. 49.2 cm, p = 0.05). Although asprosin levels were higher in newborns of mothers treated with insulin, these differences were not statistically significant. Mothers with GDM had high blood glucose levels (p = 0.032)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum levels of asprosin are increased and negatively correlated with glucose concentrations in newborns of mothers with GDM. Asprosin could be used as an early biomarker in newborns of GDM mothers.

AB  - PURPOSE: Adiponectin may be an important indicator in the regulation of fetal and neonatal growth due to its metabolism, energy balance, and insulin-sensitizing action. The current study's goal was to determine if there is a link between adiponectin +276 G/T gene polymorphism and serum adiponectin level in newborns classified as appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA), or large for gestational age (LGA)., METHODS: The study included newborns classified as AGA (n = 65), SGA (n = 65), or LGA (n = 65) according to their gestational age or birth weight. To determine the presence of adiponectin +276 G/T gene polymorphism, genotyping was done using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to determine the level of adiponectin in the blood., RESULTS: The SGA newborns had significantly lower levels of serum adiponectin than the AGA and LGA newborns. There were statistically significant differences between the genotype frequencies (GG, GT, TT) of the SGA newborns (29.9%, 45.1%, 13.9%), the AGA newborns (41.6%, 20.7%, 44.4%), and the LGA newborns (28.6%, 34.1%, 41.7%) (chi-square = 15.8; degree of freedom = 4; p = .003). The newborns carrying the GT genotype had an increased risk of being SGA compared to those carrying the GG and TT genotypes (odds ratio [OR] = 3.07; confidence interval [CI] = 95% (1.38-6.64); p = .005 and OR = 6.96; CI = 95% (2.19-22.1); p < .001, respectively). The newborns carrying the GG and TT genotypes had better protection against being SGA than those carrying the GT genotype (OR = 0.33; CI = 95% (0.15-0.72); p = .005 and OR = 0.14; CI = 95% (0.05-0.46); p < .001, respectively). The newborns carrying the GT genotype had lower birth weights, head circumferences, and ponderal indices than those carrying the TT genotype (p < .001). The serum adiponectin levels between adiponectin +276 G/T genotypes did not differ significantly (p = .429). In addition, serum adiponectin level showed a significant positive correlation with birth weight, birth length, head circumference, and ponderal index in all newborns., CONCLUSION: The results of the current study suggest that the adiponectin +276 G/T gene polymorphism was associated with an increased chance of being born SGA or LGA. The effect of this polymorphism on newborn birth size was independently associated with serum adiponectin levels. Adiponectin may play a role in fetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Herein, we measured the concentration of insulinlike growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, resistin, and visfatin in the umbilical cord blood of newborns categorized as "small for gestational age" (SGA), "appropriate for gestational age" (AGA), and "large for gestational age" (LGA). Our aim was to elucidate the link between the levels of these proteins and fetal growth., STUDY DESIGN: A total of 96 term infants were included and categorized into three weight categories. Their venous cord blood samples were collected to measure the levels of IGF-I, IGF-II, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, resistin, and visfatin., RESULTS: IGF-I, visfatin, and leptin levels showed significant differences among the groups. Pairwise comparisons showed that adiponectin (p = 0.023), resistin (p = 0.025), and ghrelin (p = 0.005) levels were significantly lower in the SGA group than in the LGA group. Correlation analyses showed a strong association of IGF-1, IGF-II, and leptin levels with birth weight (r = 0.644, p < 0.001; r = 0.441, p < 0.001; and r = 0.404, p < 0.001, respectively)., CONCLUSION: SGA newborns showed a significantly higher visfatin concentration and lower ghrelin, leptin, resistin, and adiponectin levels than the AGA and LGA newborns did.

AB  - Objective: The new adipokine, neuregulin-4 (NRG-4), acts as a signaling protein and plays a role in lipogenesis, inflammatory events and atherosclerosis. The aim was to investigate maternal levels of NRG-4 in preeclampsia (PE) disease., Material and Methods: Pregnant women with PE, divided into severe and mild PE, and gestational age-matched healthy pregnant women, as a control group, were recruited. NRG-4 levels were measured using an ELISA. NRG-4 levels in the groups and the relation between NRG-4 and clinical and laboratory parameters were analyzed., Results: There were 41 women in the PE group, 11 (26.8%) in the severe and 30 (73.2%) in the mild subgroups and 41 controls. There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of maternal age, gravidity, parity, abortion, gestational week at the time of blood sampling, levels of hemoglobin, platelet count, alanine and aspartate transaminases (p=0.067, p=0.819, p=0.957, p=0.503, p=0.054, p=0.217, p=0.306, and p=0.270 respectively). The PE group had higher body mass index, nitrogen urea and creatinine values, and diastolic and systolic blood pressure (p=0.005, p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, and p<0.001 respectively). In addition, earlier gestational week at delivery, lower birth weight and Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes and the occurrence of non-reassuring fetal heart rate tracing were found in the PE group (p=0.010, p=0.004, p=0.005, p=0.005, and p=0.026 respectively). There were no significant differences between the groups in terms of NRG-4 (p=0.611). No correlation was identified between clinical parameters examined and NRG-4 levels (p=0.722)., Conclusion: No association was found between NRG-4 concentrations and PE patients, regardless of severity of PE, compared to healthy pregnancies. Future longitudinal studies are needed to confirm this lack of association in PE.

AB  - The conventional aetiological model of obesity and diabetes proposes a genetic predisposition and a precipitation by an unhealthy adult lifestyle. This hypothesis was challenged by David Barker who proposed that the intrauterine environment influences the risk of non-communicable diseases (NCDs). The original idea was based on fetal undernutrition because lower birth weight was associated with a higher risk of diabetes and heart disease. However, soon it was clear that the association was U shaped, and that the increased risk in large babies was driven by maternal obesity and diabetes. A number of human and animal studies have refined our ideas of 'fetal programming', which is now thought to be related to acquired chemical changes in DNA (methylation), histones (acetylation and other) and the role of non-coding miRNAs. Maternal nutritional disturbances are the major programming stimulus, in addition to a deranged metabolism, infections, maternal stress, extreme atmospheric temperature, etc. The first demonstration of a link between fetal 'starvation' and future ill-health was in the Dutch Hunger Winter studies. In the prospective Pune Maternal Nutrition Study, we found that small and thin Indian babies were more adipose compared to larger English babies, and their higher risk of future diabetes was reflected in higher insulin and leptin and lower adiponectin concentrations in the cord blood. This phenotype was partly related to a deranged 1-carbon metabolism due to an imbalance in vitamin B12 (low) and folate (high) nutrition, which was also related to insulin resistance in the offspring. Maternal obesity and diabetes have made an increasing contribution to childhood obesity and diabetes at a young age. This was prominently shown in Pima Indians but is now obvious in all other populations. The best window of opportunity to prevent fetal programming of NCDs is in the periconceptional period. This is the period when gametogenesis, fertilisation, implantation, embryogenesis and placentation occur. Improving the nutrition and the health of young girls could make a substantial contribution to reducing the rapidly rising epidemic of NCDs in the world. This is referred to as 'primordial' prevention.

Indian babies (n = 157) were lighter in weight compared with white Caucasian babies [n = 67; median weight, 2805 g vs. 3475 g, respectively; P < 0.001, adjusted for gestational age and sex; -1.52 SD score; confidence interval (CI), -1.66, -1.42] and had smaller abdominal (-2.39 SD score; CI, -2.52, -2.09), midarm (-1.47 SD score; CI, -1.58, -1.34), and head (-1.23 SD score; CI, -1.42, -1.13) circumferences. However, their skinfolds were relatively preserved: subscapular (central) skinfold (-0.32 SD score; CI, -0.43, -0.20) was better preserved than triceps (peripheral) skinfold (-0.86 SD score; CI, -0.97, -0.75). Cord plasma leptin (median, 6.2 ng/ml Pune and 6.4 ng/ml London) and insulin (median, 34.7 pmol/liter Pune and 20.8 pmol/liter London) concentrations were comparable in the two populations but were higher in Indians when adjusted for birth weight, confirming relative adiposity and hyperinsulinemia of Indian babies. Indian mothers were smaller in all respects, compared with white Caucasian mothers, except subscapular skinfold, which was similar in the two populations. Our results support the intrauterine origin of adiposity, central adiposity, and hyperinsulinemia in Indians. Further research should concentrate on elucidating genetic and environmental influences on fetal growth and body composition. Prevention of insulin resistance syndrome in Indians will need to address regulation of fetal growth in addition to prevention of obesity in later life.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the effect of growth hormone (GH) therapy on appetite-regulating hormones and to examine the association between these hormones and the response to GH, body composition, and resting energy expenditure (REE)., METHODS: Nine pre-pubertal children with idiopathic short stature underwent a standard meal test before and 4 months following initiation of GH treatment. Ghrelin, GLP-1, leptin, and insulin levels were measured; area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Height, weight, body composition, REE, and insulin-like growth factor levels were recorded at baseline and after 4 and 12 months., RESULTS: Following 4 months of GH therapy, food intake increased, with increased height-standard deviation score (SDS), weight-SDS, and REE (p < .05). Significant changes in appetite-regulating hormones included a decrease in postprandial AUC ghrelin levels (p = .045) and fasting GLP-1 (p = .038), and an increase in fasting insulin (p = .043). Ghrelin levels before GH treatment were positively correlated with the changes in weight-SDS (fasting: r = .667, p = .05; AUC: r = .788, p = .012) and REE (fasting: r = .866, p = .005; AUC: r = .847, p = .008) following 4 months of GH therapy. Ghrelin AUC at 4 months was positively correlated with the changes in height-SDS (r = .741, p = .022) and fat-free-mass (r = .890, p = .001) at 12 months of GH treatment., CONCLUSIONS: The reduction in ghrelin and GLP-1 following GH treatment suggests a role for GH in appetite regulation. Fasting and meal-AUC ghrelin levels may serve as biomarkers for predicting short-term (4 months) changes in weight and longer term (12 months) changes in height following GH treatment. The mechanisms linking GH with changes in appetite-regulating hormones remain to be elucidated., ABBREVIATIONS: SDS: standard deviation score; REE: resting energy expenditure; SMT: standard meal test; AUC: area under the curve; ISS: idiopathic short stature; SGA: small for gestational age; FFM: fat-free-mass; FM: fat mass; EER: estimated energy requirements; DRI: dietary reference intakes; IQR: inter-quartile range.

AB  - Background and objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) "programs" an elevated risk of metabolic dysfunctional disorders in the offspring, and has been associated with elevated leptin and decreased adiponectin levels in cord blood. We sought to assess whether docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) supplementation in GDM affects neonatal metabolic health biomarkers especially leptin and adiponectin., Methods: In a randomized controlled trial, singleton pregnant women with de novo diagnosis of GDM at 24-28 weeks of gestation were randomized to dietary supplementation of 500 mg DHA per day (intervention, n = 30) until delivery or standard care (control, n = 38). The primary outcomes were cord blood leptin and total adiponectin concentrations. Secondary outcomes included high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentrations in cord blood, maternal glycemic control post-intervention and birth weight (z score). In parallel, 38 euglycemic pregnant women were recruited for comparisons of cord blood biomarkers., Results: There were no significant differences in cord serum leptin, total and HMW adiponectin and IGF-1 concentrations between DHA supplementation and control groups (all p > 0.05). Maternal fasting and 2-h postprandial blood glucose levels at 12-16 weeks post-intervention were similar between the two groups. The newborns in the DHA group had higher birth weight z scores (p = 0.02). Cord blood total and HMW adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower in GDM vs. euglycemic pregnancies., Conclusion: Docosahexaenoic acid supplementation at 500 mg/day in GDM women did not affect neonatal metabolic biomarkers including leptin, adiponectin and IGF-1. The results are reassuring in light of the absence of influence on neonatal adipokines (leptin and adiponectin), and potential benefits to fetal growth and development., Clinical Trial Registration: Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03569501.

AB  - In utero co-exposure to endocrine disrupting compounds can perturb fetal development. However, the effect of co-exposure on pivotal regulatory genes has seldom been investigated. We explored the effects of in utero co-exposure to cadmium (Cd), bisphenol A (BPA) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on master regulator genes. We recruited 284 healthy pregnant women, of whom 262 provided both cord blood and placenta samples, and 200 had all measurements taken. Placental Cd, cord blood BPA and total PCBs in the exposed group were higher than a reference group. KISS1 expression level in placental tissue was threefold higher in the exposed group than in the reference, and was positively associated with all toxicants. Leptin and leptin receptor expression were also significantly higher, but were only associated with BPA. From our findings, we conclude that lower birth weight is correlated with Cd and PCBs, and may result from the increased KISS1 mRNA expression. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fetuses with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) induced by prenatal nicotine exposure are susceptible to adult metabolic syndrome. Our goals for this study were to investigate the effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and glucose and lipid metabolism and to explain the susceptibility to adult metabolic syndrome for fetuses with nicotine induced-IUGR. Pregnant Wistar rats were administered 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 mg/kg nicotine subcutaneously twice a day from gestational day 11 to 20. Nicotine exposure significantly increased the levels of fetal blood corticosterone and decreased the expression of placental 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-2 (11 beta-HSD-2). Moreover, nicotine exposure significantly increased the expressions of fetal hippocampal 11 beta-HSD-1 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and decreased the expressions of fetal hypothalamus corticotropin-releasing hormone, adrenal steroid acute regulatory protein, and cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme. Additionally, increased expressions of 11 beta-HSD-1 and GR were observed in fetal liver and gastrocnemius muscle, and these tissues also expressed lower levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor, and insulin receptor, while expressing increased levels of adiponectin receptor, leptin receptors, and AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2. Prenatal nicotine exposure causes HPA axis-associated neuroendocrine metabolic alterations in fetal rats. The underlying mechanism may involve activated glucocorticoid metabolism in various fetal tissues. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Aim To explore the hypothesis that female fetus is associated with greater maternal insulin resistance during pregnancy. Methods In a singleton pregnancy cohort study (n = 299), we compared maternal insulin resistance according to fetal sex, based on plasma biomarkers from a 50-g 1-h oral glucose tolerance test at 24-28 weeks gestation. The primary outcome was plasma glucose-to-insulin ratio. Other outcomes included plasma proinsulin-to-insulin ratio, and insulin, proinsulin, leptin, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor I and II concentrations. Results After adjusting for maternal race, age, parity, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking and alcohol use, history of gestational diabetes, and gestational age at blood sampling, plasma insulin concentrations were significantly higher (mean +/- SD: 66.4 +/- 50.5 vs 51.0 +/- 46.1 mU/l; adjusted P = 0.001), and glucose-to-insulin ratios significantly lower (2.60 +/- 2.03 vs 3.77 +/- 4.98 mg/dl/mU/l; adjusted P = 0.002) in women bearing a female vs those bearing a male fetus, despite similar glucose levels (116.4 +/- 27.2 vs 117.0 +/- 31.9 mg/dl; adjusted P = 0.92). There were no significant differences in proinsulin-to-insulin ratios, or leptin, adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor I and insulin-like growth factor II concentrations by fetal sex. Conclusion Female fetus may be associated with greater maternal insulin resistance during pregnancy.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the effect of maternal hypothyroidism during pregnancy on thyroid function of the fetal rat. Female Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into two groups. Propylthiouracil (PTU) group received PTU in drinking water for 6 weeks (n= 90), normal group received normal drinking water (n= 50). The pregnant rats were obtained and had a cesarean-section to get at gestational ages of 8.5, 13, and 21 days, following blood samples and skeletal muscle were obtained from fetal rats. Levels of thyroid hormone, insulin, mitochondrial protein, and adipokines were detected using ELISA. Western blotting was performed to analyze mitochondria and insulin signal transduction-related protein in fetal rat skeletal muscle. Immunostaining of Periodic Acid-Schiff (PAS) and Oil Red O was used to observe the accumulation of muscle glycogen and lipid in the fetal rat. The results showed that the levels of thyroid hormone, insulin, insulin signal transduction-related protein, mitochondrial, and adipokines increased with the fetus developed, but had no statistical differences in the PTU group compared with the normal group. In conclusion, pregnant rats with hypothyroidism had no influence on insulin resistance (IR), lipid accumulation, and mitochondrial dysfunction in skeletal muscle of the fetal rats.

AB  - Objectives Maternal overfeeding during gestation may lead to adverse metabolic programming in the offspring mediated by epigenetic alterations. Potential reversal, in early life, of these alterations may help in the prevention of future cardio-metabolic conditions. In this context, our aims were: (1) to study the effects of maternal overfeeding on the metabolic and epigenetic programming of offspring's adipose tissue; and (2) to test the potential of postnatal metformin treatment to reverse these changes. Methods We used a swine animal model where commercial production sows were either overfed or kept under standard diet during gestation, and piglets at birth were randomly assigned to metformin (n = 16 per group) or vehicle treatment during lactation (n = 16 per group). Results Piglets born to overfed sows showed a worse metabolic profile (higher weight, weight gain from birth and abdominal circumference; all p < 0.05) together with altered serological markers (increased HOMA-IR, fructosamine, total cholesterol, C-Reactive Protein and lower HMW adiponectin; all p < 0.05). The visceral adipose tissue also showed altered morphology (increased adipocyte area, perimeter and diameter; all p < 0.05), as well as changes in gene expression (higher CCL2 and INSR, lower DLK1; all p < 0.05), and in DNA methylation (96 hypermethylated and 99 hypomethylated CpG sites; FDR < 0.05). Metformin treatment significantly ameliorated the abnormal metabolic profile, decreasing piglets' weight, weight gain from birth, abdominal circumference and fructosamine (all p < 0.05) and reduced adipocyte area, perimeter, and diameter in visceral adipose tissue (all p < 0.05). In addition, metformin treatment potentiated several associations between gene expression in visceral adipose tissue and the altered metabolic markers. Conclusions Maternal overfeeding during gestation leads to metabolic abnormalities in the offspring, including adipose tissue alterations. Early metformin treatment mitigates these effects and could help rescue the offspring's metabolic health.

AB  - A number of studies have reported the occurrence of long-term metabolic disorders in mammals following intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). However, the effects of dietary patterns during IUGR have not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to evaluate the effects of different dietary patterns during critical growth windows on metabolic outcomes in the offspring of rats with IUGR. Male offspring rats from mothers fed either a normal or low-protein diet were randomly assigned to one of the following groups: Normal diet throughout pregnancy, lactation and after weaning (CON); normal diet throughout pregnancy and high-fat diet throughout lactation and after weaning (N + H + H); low-protein diet throughout pregnancy and high-fat diet throughout lactation and after weaning (IUGR + H + H); low-protein diet throughout pregnancy and lactation and high-fat diet after weaning (IUGR + L + H); and low-protein diet throughout pregnancy and normal diet throughout lactation and after weaning. During lactation, the male offspring in the N + H + H group exhibited the fastest growth rate, whereas the slowest rate was in the IUGR + L + H group. Following weaning, all IUGR groups demonstrated significant catch-up growth. Abnormal insulin tolerance were observed in the N + H + H, IUGR + H + H and IUGR + L + H groups and insulin sensitivity was decreased in IUGR + L + H group. The triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein ratio in the IUGR + L + H group was significantly higher compared with in the other groups. The abdominal circumference, Lee's index and adipocyte diameter of IUGR groups were significantly increased compared with the CON group. High levels of leptin and interleukin-6 in adipose tissues, and low adiponectin were observed in the IUGR + L + H group. Different dietary patterns during specific growth windows showed numerous impacts on glycolipid metabolism in IUGR offspring. The present study elucidated the mechanisms and potential options for IUGR treatment and prevention. Copyright: © Wu et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the associations between low birth weight (LBW) versus high birth weight (HBW) and dysglycemia, including insulin resistance (IR) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) in children, and aimed to explore the role of adipose tissue in these relationships., METHODS: A total of 2,935 subjects aged 6 to 18 years were recruited to examine the relationship between birth weight and IR (defined as homeostasis model assessment of IR > 2.3) and IFG. Mediation analyses were conducted to examine the roles of various adipokines and anthropometrics in these relationships., RESULTS: Children with LBW had a nearly twofold increased risk of IR and IFG compared with children with normal birth weight, even after adjusting for BMI. Decreased circulating adiponectin levels contributed to 21.2% of the LBW-IR relationship, whereas none of the selected adipose markers mediated the LBW-IFG relationship. In contrast, after controlling for current BMI or waist circumference, HBW reduced the risk of IR by 34%, but it was not associated with IFG. The HBW-IR relationship was significantly mediated by reduced leptin levels (21.4%) and fat mass percentage (8.8%), after controlling for BMI., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest the potential role of adipose tissue dysfunction as an underlying mechanism for the birth weight-type 2 diabetes relationship.

AB  - Chicken is widely favored by consumers because of some unique features. The leg muscles occupy an important position in the market. However, the specific mechanism for regulating muscle growth speed is not clear. In this experiment, we used Jinghai yellow chickens with different body weights at 300 days as research subjects. The chickens were divided into fast- and slow-growing groups, and we collected leg muscles after slaughtering for use in RNA-seq. After comparing the two groups, 87 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified (fold change >= 2 and FDR < 0.05). The fast-growing group had 42 up-regulated genes and 45 down-regulated genes among these DEGs compared to the slow-growing group. Six items were significantly enriched in the biological process: embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching, chordate embryonic development, embryonic skeletal system development, and embryo development as well as responses to ketones and the sulfur compound biosynthetic process. Two significantly enriched pathways were found in the KEGG pathway analysis (P-value < 0.05): the insulin signaling pathway and the adipocytokine signaling pathway. This study provides a theoretical basis for the molecular mechanism of chicken growth and for improving the production of Jinghai yellow chicken.

AB  - It's known that blood leptin level is reduced in intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) fetus, and placental leptin is the major source of fetal blood leptin. This study aimed to investigate the decreased fetal blood leptin level by prenatal caffeine exposure (PCE) and its underlying placental mechanisms. Pregnant Wistar rats were intragastrically administered caffeine (30-120 mg/kg day) from gestational day 9 to 20. The level of fetal serum leptin and the expression of placental leptin-related genes were analyzed. Furthermore, we investigated the molecular mechanism of the reduced placental leptin's expression by treatment with caffeine (0.8-20 muM) in the BeWo cells. In vivo, PCE significantly decreased fetal serum leptin level in caffeine dose-dependent manner. Meanwhile, placental mRNA expression of adenosine A2a receptor (Adora2a), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), a short-type leptin receptor (Ob-Ra) and leptin was reduced in the PCE groups. In vitro, caffeine significantly decreased the mRNA expression of leptin, CREB and ADORA2A in concentration and time-dependent manners. The addition of ADORA2A agonist or adenylyl cyclase (AC) agonist reversed the inhibition of leptin expression induced by caffeine. PCE induced a lower level of fetal blood leptin, which the primary mechanism is that caffeine inhibited antagonized Adora2a and AC activities to decreased cAMP synthesis, thus inhibited the expression of the transcription factor CREB and target gene leptin in the placenta. Meantime, the reduced transportation of maternal leptin by placental Ob-Ra also contributed to the reduced fetal blood leptin. Together, PCE decreased fetal blood leptin mainly via reducing the expression and transportation of leptin in the placenta. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the effect of mouse resistin on insulin-resistance has been well defined, but the biological function of human resistin is still unknown. This study was aimed to explore the possible physiological and pathological effects of human resistin, as well as the tissue distribution of human resistin and correlation of resistin gene expression with leukemia incidence. 152 leukemia patients without inflammatory complication and 100 healthy persons were selected as experimental and control groups respectively. The blood samples were collected, the total RNA was extracted, the expression distribution of resistin in different tissues was detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR and then the statistical analysis was carried out. The results indicated that the expression of the human resistin gene was detected in normal fetus liver, adult bone marrow and umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood cells, while the resistin gene could not be amplified in fat, umbilical cord, placenta and adult liver. The resistin expression was detected in 21% leukemia patients and 27% healthy persons. The difference of the resistin gene expression between the two groups was not statistically significant (p>0.05). It is concluded that the higher expression of resistin exists in normal human fetus liver, adult bone marrow, umbilical cord blood and peripheral blood cells, which indicates that the distribution of human resistin correlates with normal hematopoiesis in certain extent, but its expression level and rate may not correlate with the incidence of leukemia.

AB  - Human placental GH (hGH-V) is a variant of pituitary hGH (hGH-N) synthesized and secreted by syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy. It differs from hGH-V by only 13 amino acid residues, which makes difficult a specific measurement of hGH-V without interference from hGH-N. To overcome the analytical difficulties, we produced new high affinity monoclonal antibodies specific for hGH-V. Precise screening and epitope mapping allowed identification of a pair of monoclonal antibodies suitable to establish a highly sensitive assay for hGH-V measurement. In a prospective, longitudinal study involving 84 normal pregnancies, we measured maternal concentrations of hGH-V, leptin, IGF-I, and cord blood IGF-I. hGH-V was detectable as early as gestational week (GW) 7. Mean concentrations of hGH-V increased from 0.9 +/- 0.5 microg/liter (GW 7-13) to 2.8 +/- 0.9 microg/liter (GW 18-22), 7.3 +/- 2.6 microg/liter (GW 28-32), and 13.0 +/- 9.6 (GW 37-41). A negative correlation was found between prepregnancy body mass index and hGH-V concentrations from GW 28 onward. Peak hGH-V levels occurred at wk 36.5 +/- 2.6 and were significantly lower in obese (P = 0.029) and higher in underweight (P = 0.035) mothers compared with those in mothers of normal weight. The increase in hGH-V between GW 18-22 and GW 28-32 was negatively correlated to the increase in maternal leptin during this period (P = 0.027). Maternal IGF-I concentrations were correlated to those of hGH-V from GW 18 onward (P = 0.039). The strongest correlation was found at GW 28-32 (P = 0.001). Furthermore, maternal hGH-V concentrations in late pregnancy correlated with cord blood IGF-I (P = 0.025) and size of the newborn (P = 0.017). These results, obtained by a new, highly sensitive hGH-V-specific immunoassay, highlight the importance of maternal hGH-V in the regulation of maternal and fetal IGF-I. In addition, the results indicate that maternal weight has a major impact on circulating concentrations of hGH-V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether fetal leptin levels correlate with fetal weight and whether such correlation is direct or indirect via insulin or human placental lactogen (hPL), respectively., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of offspring at term (n=175) with over-representation of large-for-gestational age (LGA; n=70) and small-for-gestational age (SGA; n=23) cases in a population of Caucasian women with no pregnancy pathology., METHODS: Fetal cord blood was collected after delivery. In several cases (n=62) paired mother-fetus blood samples were obtained. Leptin, insulin and hPL levels were measured by RIA. Anthropometric data (birth weight, body mass index, placental weight) were recorded., RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Maternal insulin, hPL and leptin levels were higher than fetal concentrations. Cord blood leptin levels positively correlated with the anthropometric data with stronger correlations in female (0.54<r<0.66) than in male (0.32<r<0.39) neonates. Cord blood leptin levels did not differ between appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA; n=82) and SGA (n=23) neonates, but were higher (P<0.001) by 83% in LGA (n=70) than in AGA neonates. Among the different weight classes the correlations between fetal leptin and anthropometric data were only observed in LGAs, but not in AGAs or SGAs. Fetal, but not maternal, leptin levels strongly correlated with fetal insulin (r=0.56; P<0.001). After accounting for this close relationship insulin could no longer be used to predict birth weight (r=0.15, P=0.051). We suggest that the correlation of cord blood insulin with neonatal weight in LGAs is, in addition to insulin's direct anabolic action, indirectly mediated via leptin. It is hypothesized that fetal insulin stimulates fetal adipocyte leptin production.

AB  - Leptin is a peptide synthesised in white fat tissue adipocytes. It plays a key role in appetite regulation and body mass development. The leptin's concentration is correlated with body fat magazines. This hormone has also anorectic and sympatheticomimetic function. Leptin's concentration measured early after birth is strictly connected with birth-weight. Smoking during pregnancy leads to decrease of plasma leptin concentration in newborn. The aim of the study was estimation of the leptin level in umbilical cord blood of children born from smoking and no-smoking women. Some other somatic parameters were also analysed. A cohort of 210 women and their children born in the Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology Medical University of Gdansk was examined. The estimation of frequency of smoking during pregnancy was analysed by questionnaire done in this group. Samples of the umbilical cord blood were collected after birth and leptin concentration was analysed by standard RIA method. Significantly lower leptin concentration in smoking mothers' newborns was stated. Children born from smoking mothers had significantly lower birth weight and length. The frequency of smoking during pregnancy in analysed region is lower in compare to previous years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klotho serum levels reflect nutritional state in adults including obesity and anorexia. The relationship between cord blood klotho levels at birth and parameters of growth including anthropometrics are not known., METHODS: We evaluated the relationship between cord blood klotho, leptin and adipocyte hormones and infant, child and maternal anthropometrics and maternal depression in a cohort of 73 children. Non-parametric tests were used to assess differences between dichotomous and categorical predictors and klotho levels and Spearman's rank coefficients were used to assess the relationship between klotho levels and continuous predictors. A multivariable log transformed linear regression model was used to test for independent predictors of serum klotho levels., RESULTS: Mean klotho levels were 2864.9+/-1409.7 (pg/mL) in cord blood and we found no relationship with infant sex, delivery specifics including gestational age or anthropometrics at birth. There was similarly no association between klotho levels at birth and future obesity at age 2. Leptin levels at birth were inversely associated with klotho levels in multivariable models after adjusting for other covariates (p<0.01). Similarly, in multivariable models insulin levels were inversely correlated with klotho levels (p=0.03). Leptin levels in our cohort of at-risk infants were more than 50% higher than other studies with neonates., CONCLUSIONS: We found no associations between weight or length at birth or obesity in early childhood and cord blood klotho levels. Cord blood klotho levels were inversely correlated with leptin and insulin levels at birth and should be further investigated to better understand the inter-relationship between this hormone and key regulators of growth and adiposity.

AB  - Overweight and obesity have become a dangerous disease requiring multiple interventions, treatment and preventions. In women of reproductive age, obesity is one of the most common medical conditions. Among others, obese state is characterized by low-grade systemic inflammation and enhanced oxidative stress. Increased maternal body mass index might amplify inflammation and reactive oxygen species production, which is associated with unfavourable clinical outcomes that affect both mother and child. Intrauterine growth retardation, preeclampsia, or gestational diabetes mellitus are examples of the hampered maternal and foetoplacental unit interactions. Visfatin is the obesity-related adipokine produced mainly by the visceral adipose tissue. Visfatin affects glucose homeostasis, as well as the regulation of genes related to oxidative stress and inflammatory response. Here, we review visfatin interactions in pregnancy-related disorders linked to obesity. We highlight the possible predictive and prognostic value of visfatin in diagnostic strategies on gravidas with obesity. Copyright © 2020 World Obesity Federation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships among serum leptin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin levels in large for gestational age (LGA) infants., METHODS: Serum samples were collected from maternal veins and umbilical arteries of 52 consecutive, term, LGA neonates of nondiabetic mothers. Maternal and neonatal serum samples were analyzed for levels of leptin, insulin-like growth factor-I, and insulin by specific radioimmunoassays. Multiple regression analysis was used to determine independent risk factors for fetal macrosomia., RESULTS: The independent risk factor significantly associated with fetal macrosomia was umbilical cord leptin concentration (P <.01, beta = 0.59). There was a statistically significant correlation between umbilical cord leptin and insulin-like growth factor-I levels and birth weight (r = 0.51, P <.01; r = 0.37, P <.01; respectively). The correlation between umbilical cord insulin levels and birth weight was not statistically significant (r = 0.06, P =.63), nor was that between maternal body mass index and birth weight (r = 0.09, P =.50)., CONCLUSION: Our data showed that umbilical cord leptin concentration was an independent risk factor for fetal macrosomia.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of birth weight (BW), birth length (BL) and gestational age (GA) on growth pattern and metabolic profile in appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) growth hormone-deficient children before and during recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy. Forty children with isolated idiopathic growth hormone deficiency underwent auxological and biochemical assessment at baseline and after 6 and 12 months of rhGH therapy. Biochemical analysis included: insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), adiponectin, resistin, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, total cholesterol (total-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c). There was a tendency for positive association between BW and baseline height standard deviation score (SDS). GA correlated with baseline weight SDS (p=0.019) and BMI SDS (p=0.039). GA was associated with baseline fasting glucose (p=0.031), fasting insulin (p=0.027), HOMA-IR (p=0.010) and QUICKI (p=0.016). BW correlated with baseline HbA1c (p=0.032). After the initiation of rhGH therapy we did not find any significant relationships between birth size parameters or GA and metabolic profile of the studied children. In conclusion, our results suggest that AGA GH-deficient children born with higher birth size parameters and higher GA had better first-year growth response to rhGH therapy and better baseline metabolic profile, especially parameters of carbohydrate metabolism. In order to optimize the effects of rhGH therapy, higher rhGH doses should be considered in those GH-deficient children who were born with lower birth size and GA.

AB  - Adiponectin is a cytokine built with 244 amino acids. It is produced and secreted by adipose tissue. The concentration of this hormone in serum fluctuates from 1 to 30 mug/ml. The main function of this cytokine is the control of metabolism, carbohydrates and lipids. Women have higher concentration of adiponectin than men. Its high concentration is observed in those suffering from anorexia and bulimia. Its reduced concentration decreases insulin levels, and leads to the development of diabetes and lipodystrophy. It is believed that low adiponectin level contributes to the development of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular complications including unstable coronary artery disease. Mechanisms of synthesis regulation have not been thoroughly understood. One describes only the increase of adiponectin gene expression regulated by receptors activated by peroxisome proliferation. Adiponectin is present in breast milk where it plays an important role in the development of the infant. The newborn has higher adiponectin level than the adult; it correlates with the maturity of foetus and its body weight. Full-term newborns with normal birth weight have higher concentration of adiponectin than the premature infants and newborns with low birth weight. Infants with macrosomia have lower concentration of this hormone than children with normal and low birth weight, despite their similar BMI. In the prepubertal age, the value of adiponectin is a good indicator of insulin resistance. Changes in the concentration of adiponectin in foetuses and newborns, under the influence of not fully explained factors, may affect their development and lead to childhood obesity. In the first year of life, there is a progressive decrease in the concentration of this hormone.Copyright © 2016 Polish Pediatric Society

AB  - Objective Adiponectin and leptin play an important role in the children development, but the effect of early-onset neonatal infections on their values is not well known. Aim The evaluation of serum adiponectin and leptin concentrations in healthy and infected full-term newborns, according to their gender, type of delivery, birth asphyxia and kind of infection and determination of correlations between concentrations of these two hormones and anthropometric parameters. Material and methods The study involved 166 newborns (95 boys, 71 girls), among them 85 infected and 81 healthy. Hormone concentrations were measured between 3rd and 7th day of life by ELISA method. Results Septic newborns have significantly higher adiponectin concentration than healthy, and septic and local infected babies have higher leptin value than healthy, independently of their gender, anthropometric parameters, birth asphyxia and type of delivery. In healthy newborns negative correlation between adiponectin value and chest circumference, and between leptin concentration and body length was noted. Healthy female newborns have significantly higher leptin values than boys; healthy newborns born by elective cesarean section have higher adiponectin concentration than born spontaneously. Positive correlation between adiponectin and leptin concentrations in infected newborns was stated. Conclusions 1. Early-onset infections in full-term eutrophic newborns contribute to increase of adiponectin and leptin concentrations, independently of their gender, birth asphyxia and type of delivery. 2. In infected newborns any significant correlations between adiponectin concentrations and birth weight, body length, chest and head circumferences were noted.Copyright © 2017 Polish Pediatric Society

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to investigate the pathophysiological role of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) system in insulin resistance in patients with gestational diabetes (GDM) and during the course of normal pregnancy. Patients and methods: Thirty women with GDM (16-39 gestational weeks), 35 healthy pregnant women (15 first, nine second and I I third trimester) and 25 healthy age-matched non-pregnant women were studied. Serum TNF-alpha, and its soluble receptors I and 2 (sTNFR-1 and -2) were measured. Results: In non-diabetic pregnant women in the third trimester all measures were significantly higher (P < 0.05 or less) than in the first trimester and in non-pregnant women (BMI 27.6 +/- 4.1 ( S.D.), 24.1 +/- 2.6, 22.4 +/- 2.4 kg/m(2)), serum TNF-alpha (4.6 +/- 0.6, 4.1 +/- 0.4, 4.1 +/- 0.4 ng/l), sTNFR-1 (2.7 +/- 0.9, 2.0 +/- 0.5, 2.0 +/- 0.1 mug/l), sTNFR-2 (5.6 +/- 2.6, 4.6 +/- 2.1, 3.3 +/- 0.2 mug/l), C-peptide (3.1 +/- 1.7, 1.1 +/- 0.7, 1.1 +/- 0.8 mug/l), and C-peptide:blood glucose ratio (0.6 +/- 0.2, 0.2 +/- 0.1, 0.2 +/- 0.1 mug/mmol). In GDM these measures were even higher than in any subgroup of healthy pregnant women (BMI) (33.4 +/- 6.4 kg/m(2), TNF-alpha) (6.3 +/- 0.6 mug/l), sTNFR-1 (3.0 +/- 0.5 mug/l), sTNFR-2 (10.0 +/- 6.9 mug/l, C-peptide 6.0 +/- 2.7 mug/l, C-peptide:blood glucose ratio: 1.2 +/- 0.5 mug/mmol, P < 0.01). Significant (P < 0.01) positive linear correlations were found in gestational diabetic and non-diabetic women between serum TNF-alpha, C-peptide levels, and BMI In gestational diabetic women, in multivariate analysis studying the dependency of C-peptide only BMI remained significant (r(2) = 0.67, P = 0.01). Conclusions: Our observation emphasizes the obesity-related component of insulin resistance driven by adipocytokines, such as TNF-alpha and its receptors during the course of normal pregnancy and GDM.

AB  - CONTEXT: Low birth weight is associated with increased risks for adult cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM2). Adiponectin and resistin are hormones, considered, respectively, protective and disadvantageous regarding these risks. No data exist on the effect of long-term GH treatment on these hormones and inflammatory markers in children born small for gestational age (SGA)., OBJECTIVE: To describe longitudinal changes in inflammatory markers and adipocytokines during and after a long-term dose-response GH study., DESIGN: Longitudinal dose-response study [group A: 1 mg/m(2) body surface area (BSA) (approximately 0.033 mg/kg/day) vs. group B: 2 mg/m(2) BSA (approximately 0.067 mg/kg/day)] and comparison with age-related controls., PATIENTS: One hundred and three SGA children., MEASUREMENTS: We measured adiponectin, resistin, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels at baseline, after 1 and 7 years of GH treatment and 6 months after discontinuation of GH., RESULTS: Adiponectin levels decreased over time, but remained comparable with controls. Resistin levels increased and remained lower or comparable with controls. There were no significant differences between the GH dosage groups. After the GH treatment was stopped, adiponectin was decreased in group B and resistin increased in group A. GH therapy did not affect IL-6 and CRP levels at any time point. An increase in body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS) over time was associated with a decrease in adiponectin levels. None of the markers were associated with insulin sensitivity., CONCLUSIONS: Long-term GH treatment is not associated with disadvantageous changes in adiponectin, resistin, IL-6 and CRP levels, neither during nor after GH treatment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin and resistin are fat cell-derived hormones, which are thought to be respectively protective and disadvantageous with regard to the development of cardiovascular disease and diabetes mellitus type 2. Low birth weight has been associated with increased risks for the development of these diseases. In short, small-for-gestational-age (SGA) children, GH therapy has several positive effects regarding cardiovascular risk factors. On the other hand, concern has been expressed about the effects of GH therapy on insulin sensitivity., METHODS: We measured adiponectin and resistin levels in 136 short prepubertal children born SGA and their association with cardiovascular risk parameters and growth factors. Also, we compared the levels with normal-statured controls. The effect of GH treatment was evaluated in 50 short SGA children vs. baseline and vs. an untreated sex- and age-matched SGA control group., RESULTS: Short SGA children had similar adiponectin and lower resistin levels, compared with normal-statured controls. In GH-treated SGA children, neither adiponectin nor resistin levels changed significantly during 2 yr of GH treatment. Compared with untreated sex- and age-matched SGA controls, GH-treated SGA children had similar adiponectin and lower resistin levels. Adiponectin correlated inversely with age but not any cardiovascular risk parameter or growth factor. Higher IGF-I levels in GH-treated children were associated with lower resistin levels., CONCLUSIONS: Compared with normal-statured controls, short prepubertal SGA children had similar adiponectin and lower resistin levels. Two years of GH treatment had no effect on their adiponectin and resistin levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Lipid derangements during early postnatal life may induce stable epigenetic changes and alter metabolic programming. We investigated associations between serum lipid profiles in very young children and DNA methylation of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) and leptin (LEP). Secondly, we explored if the maternal serum lipid profile modifies DNA methylation in the child., METHODS AND RESULTS: In 120 healthy children at 17 months of age, DNA methylation of TNFalpha and LEP was measured in DNA derived from whole blood. Linear mixed models were used to calculate exposure-specific differences and associations. Total cholesterol in children was associated with decreased methylation of TNFalpha (-5.8%, p = 0.036), and HDL-cholesterol was associated with decreased methylation of both TNFalpha (-6.9%, p = 0.013) and LEP (-3.4%, p = 0.021). Additional adjustment for gestational age at birth, birth weight, sex, breastfeeding and educational level attenuated the effects, TNFalpha (-6.1%, p = 0.058) and LEP (-3.1%, p = 0.041). In mothers, HDL-cholesterol only was associated with decreased methylation of TNFalpha in the child (-8.7%, p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Our data support the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis by showing that total cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol levels in very young children are associated with epigenetic metabolic programming, which may affect their vulnerability for developing cardiovascular diseases in later life.

AB  - Aims/hypothesis Antenatal obesity and associated gestational diabetes (GDM) are increasing worldwide. While pre-existing insulin resistance is implicated in GDM in obese women, the responsible metabolic pathways remain poorly described. Our aim was to compare metabolic profiles in blood of obese pregnant women with and without GDM 10 weeks prior to and at the time of diagnosis by OGTT. Methods We investigated 646 women, of whom 198 developed GDM, in this prospective cohort study, a secondary analysis of UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial (UPBEAT), a multicentre randomised controlled trial of a complex lifestyle intervention in obese pregnant women. Multivariate regression analyses adjusted for multiple testing, and accounting for appropriate confounders including study intervention, were performed to compare obese women with GDM with obese non-GDM women. We measured 163 analytes in serum, plasma or whole blood, including 147 from a targeted NMR metabolome, at time point 1 (mean gestational age 17 weeks 0 days) and time point 2 (mean gestational age 27 weeks 5 days, at time of OGTT) and compared them between groups. Results Multiple significant differences were observed in women who developed GDMcompared with women without GDM (false discovery rate corrected p values < 0.05). Most were evident prior to diagnosis. Women with GDM demonstrated raised lipids and lipoprotein constituents in VLDL subclasses, greater triacylglycerol enrichment across lipoprotein particles, higher branched-chain and aromatic amino acids and different fatty acid, ketone body, adipokine, liver and inflammatory marker profiles compared with those without GDM. Conclusions/interpretation Among obese pregnant women, differences in metabolic profile, including exaggerated dyslipidaemia, are evident at least 10 weeks prior to a diagnosis of GDM in the late second trimester.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of the adipokines adiponectin and leptin in cord blood and placental and fetal tissues suggests a possible role in fetal development., METHODS: We measured concentrations of adiponectin and leptin in maternal serum, cord blood, and breast milk and examined their correlations within a large, population-based study. Between November 2000 and November 2001, we recruited all mothers and their newborns after delivery at the University of Ulm (Ulm, Germany). The current analysis included 766 mothers with available breast milk samples collected 6 weeks postpartum. Adipokine concentrations were measured with commercially available ELISAs (R&D Systems)., RESULTS: Median adiponectin concentrations in maternal serum (n=713), cord blood (n=709), and breast milk (n=766) were 8.6 mg/L, 30.6 mg/L, and 10.9 microg/L, respectively. Median leptin concentrations were 12.8 microg/L in maternal serum, 7.8 microg/L in cord blood, and 174.5 ng/L in breast milk. Whereas increases in leptin concentrations with increasing birth weight, birth weight according to gestational age, and ponderal index were statistically significant in cord blood (all P values<0.0001), cord blood adiponectin was clearly related only to birth weight (P=0.0004). Concentrations of both adipokines were moderately correlated in breast milk and maternal serum (both Spearman rho values were 0.43; P<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of adiponectin and leptin vary strongly in maternal serum, cord blood, and breast milk, with only moderate correlations between both adipokines in maternal serum and breast milk. The health implications of these patterns warrant further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is evidence that South Asian individuals have higher fat mass for a given weight than Europeans. One study reported that the greater fatness for a given birthweight may increase with increasing birth weight, suggesting that any attempt to increase mean birth weight in South Asians would markedly increase their fatness., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to examine whether differences in cord leptin values between White British and Pakistani infants vary by birth weight category., METHOD: We examined the difference in cord leptin levels between 659 White British and 823 Pakistani infants recruited to the Born in Bradford cohort study, by clinical categories and thirds of the birth weight distribution., RESULTS: Pakistani infants had a lower mean birthweight but higher cord leptin levels than White British infants [ratio of geometric mean(RGM) of cord leptin adjusted for birth weight = 1.36 (95% CI 1.26,1.46)]. Birthweight was positively associated with cord leptin levels in both groups, with no evidence that the regression lines in the two groups diverged from each other with increasing birthweight. The relative ethnic difference in cord leptin was similar in low (<2500 g), normal and high (>=4000 g) birthweight infants(P-value for interaction = 0.91). It was also similar across thirds of the birthweight distribution [RGM (95% CI) in lowest, mid and highest thirds were 1.37 (1.20, 1.57), 1.36 (1.20, 1.54) and 1.31 (1.16, 1.52), respectively, P-interaction = 0.51]., CONCLUSIONS: We found marked differences in cord leptin levels between Pakistani and White British infants but no evidence that this difference increases with increasing birthweight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown markedly lower birth weight among infants of South Asian origin compared with those of White European origin. Whether such differences mask greater adiposity in South Asian infants and whether they persist across generations in contemporary UK populations is unclear. Our aim was to compare birth weight, skinfold thickness and cord leptin between Pakistani and White British infants and to investigate the explanatory factors, including parental and grandparental birthplace., METHODS: We examined the differences in birth weight and skinfold thickness between 4649 Pakistani and 4055 White British infants born at term in the same UK maternity unit and compared cord leptin in a subgroup of 775 Pakistani and 612 White British infants., RESULTS: Pakistani infants were lighter (adjusted mean difference -234 g 95% CI -258 to -210) and were smaller in both subscapular and triceps skinfold measurements. The differences for subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness (mean z-score difference -0.27 95% CI -0.34 to -0.20 and -0.23 95% CI -0.30 to -0.16, respectively) were smaller than the difference in birth weight (mean z-score difference -0.52 95% CI -0.58 to -0.47) and attenuated to the null with adjustment for birth weight (0.03 95% CI -0.03 to 0.09 and -0.01 95% CI -0.08 to 0.05, respectively). Cord leptin concentration (indicator of fat mass) was similar in Pakistani and White British infants without adjustment for birth weight, but with adjustment became 30% higher (95% CI 17% to 44%) among Pakistani infants compared with White British infants. The magnitudes of difference did not differ by generation., CONCLUSIONS: Despite being markedly lighter, Pakistani infants had similar skinfold thicknesses and greater total fat mass, as indicated by cord leptin, for a given birth weight than White British infants. Any efforts to reduce ethnic inequalities in birth weight need to consider differences in adiposity and the possibility that increasing birth weight in South Asian infants might inadvertently worsen health by increasing relative adiposity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Being born with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) was associated with subsequent health issues later in life. However, the underlying role of adipokines in IUGR is unknown., OBJECTIVES: To measure the adiponectin and leptin concentrations in the cord blood of monochorionic (MC) twins with selective IUGR (sIUGR) and evaluate their associations with childhood growth trajectories., METHODS: Cord blood samples were collected from 22 pairs of MC twins with sIUGR and 20 pairs of normal MC twins. Adiponectin and leptin concentrations in cord blood were determined by ELISA. Data regarding perinatal outcomes and infantile growth trajectories from birth to 24 months were obtained., RESULTS: Only cord blood adiponectin concentrations were associated with IUGR (beta -1.51, 95% CI -2.45, -0.57, p = 0.002), and cord blood leptin concentrations were significantly lower in sIUGR twins compared to normal twins (2.8 +/- 1.6 vs. 6.4 +/- 3.0, p < 0.001). Adiponectin concentrations were negatively associated with height increments from birth to 6 months (beta -0.28, 95% CI -0.51, -0.06, p = 0.015). Leptin concentrations were negatively associated with weight at 6 and 24 months (beta -0.12 95% CI -0.22, -0.02, p = 0.002; beta -0.18 95% CI -0.33, -0.03, p = 0.019) and weight and height increments from birth to 6 months (beta -0.17 95% CI -0.29, -0.06, p = 0.020; beta -0.40 95% CI -0.81, -0.01, p = 0.037)., CONCLUSION: Cord blood adiponectin concentrations were negatively associated with IUGR but did not predict childhood growth. Cord blood leptin concentrations were inversely associated with weight and height increments in the first 6 months. Copyright © 2023 World Obesity Federation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A dysfunction of the sympathetic nervous system may contribute to the development of hypertension and obesity in subjects with low birth weight (LBW). The present study examines resting sympathetic nerve traffic and its baroreflex modulation to the muscle vascular bed in healthy LBW subjects., DESIGN: Case-control studies of 13 healthy LBW subjects (< 2500 g at term) aged 20-30 years and 13 normal birth weight subjects (NBW; 3200-3700 g) closely matched for age, gender and body mass index., METHODS: Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) recordings from the superficial peroneal nerve, blood pressure and heart rate were obtained at rest, during an inspiratory apnoea and a cold pressor test. Baroreflex function was evaluated by short-term infusion of nitroprusside and phenylephrine, respectively, in nine subjects of each group., RESULTS: During resting conditions burst frequency was significantly lower in LBW subjects (LBW: 24.7 +/- 2.4; NBW: 34.4 +/- 2.1 bursts/min, P < 0.05). When normalized for the different baseline values, baroreflex-mediated changes in MSNA were similar in both groups. Maximal MSNA levels in response to inspiratory apnoea and the cold pressor test did not differ between the groups. Blood pressure and heart rate were similar in LBW and NBW subjects both at rest and during sympatho-excitatory manoeuvres., CONCLUSIONS: Subjects born too small for their gestational age show a significantly lower sympathetic nerve activity under baseline conditions. Given the different baseline values, the sympathetic response to haemodynamic alteration is not affected in LBW subjects, and maximal activation during non-haemodynamic sympatho-excitatory manoeuvres is preserved.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether adiponectin is a predictive factor for gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and is appropriate as a screening test for GDM. Three-hundred and fifty-nine women with singleton pregnancy and indications for GDM screening according to criteria of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists were enrolled in the study between July 5, 2004 and March 11, 2005. After confirming gestational age (GA) and number of fetuses by ultrasound, all women underwent a 1-h glucose challenge test with 50 g glucose load (50-g GCT) between 21 and 27 weeks of GA. Blood samples for determination of adiponectin levels were also obtained on the same day. Subsequently, between 24 and 28 weeks of GA, the women underwent an oral glucose tolerance test with 100 g glucose load (100-g OGTT). The diagnosis of GDM was established when two or more of the following criteria were fulfilled: (1) fasting glucose >95 mg/dl; (2) 1-h glucose >180 mg/dl; (3) 2-h glucose >155 mg/dl; (4) 3-h glucose >140 mg/dl. Sixty women were diagnosed with GDM, a prevalence of 16.7%. There was no difference in age between the GDM and non-GDM groups. Prepregnancy and sampling-day body mass index (BMI), increase in weight and all blood glucose levels were greater in women with GDM than in those without (p < 0.05). Adiponectin concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with GA and plasma glucose levels of the GCT and each OGTT. Using logistic regression analyses, adiponectin, but not age, prepregnancy BMI and increase in weight, was demonstrated as an independent predictive factor for GDM. The area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve of adiponectin was significantly lower than that of the GCT [0.63 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.53-0.67) vs. 0.73 (95% CI 0.71-0.80), p < 0.001]. At a cut-off value of 140 mg/dl of the 50-g GCT, the sensitivity and specificity of the test were 90% and 61 %, respectively. The 50-g GCT could identify GDM in 54 (90%) out of 60 women. On the other hand, at an arbitrary cut-off value of 10 mu g/ml for adiponectin, sensitivity of 91 % and specificity of 31% were achieved. If this cut-off value was used for ruling in or out pregnant women for the GDM screening, 27% of all women could be eliminated from needing to perform an OGTT, with five women (8.3%) misclassified. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that adiponectin was an independent predictor for GDM. As for GDM screening, adiponectin was not as strong a predictor as GCT. However, with advantage of being less cumbersome, adiponectin could be used to rule out pregnant women at low risk of GDM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical exercise induces positive alterations in gene expression involved in the metabolism of obesity. Maternal exercise provokes adaptations soon after birth in the offspring. Here, we investigated whether adult mouse offspring of swim-trained mothers is protected against the development of the deleterious effects of high fat diet (HFD)., METHODS: Our study comprises two parts. First, female C57BL/6 mice were divided into one sedentary and one swim-trained group (before and during pregnancy, n = 18). In the second part, adult offspring (n = 12) of trained and sedentary mothers was challenged to HFD for 16 weeks. Notably, most of the analysis was done in male offspring., RESULTS: Our results demonstrate that maternal exercise has several beneficial effects on the mouse offspring and protects them from the deleterious effects of HFD in the adult. Specifically, swimming during pregnancy leads to lower birth weight in offspring through 2 months of age. When subjected to HFD for 4 month in the adulthood, our study presents novel data on the male offspring's metabolism of trained mothers. The offspring gained less weight, which was accompanied by less body fat, and they used more calories during daytime compared with offspring of sedentary mothers. Furthermore, we observed increased adiponectin expression in skeletal muscle, which was accompanied by decreased leptin levels and increased insulin sensitivity. Decreased interleukin-6 expression and increased peptide PYY levels were observed in sera of adult offspring of mothers that swam during pregnancy., CONCLUSIONS: Our results point to the conclusion that maternal exercise is beneficial to protect the offspring from developing obesity, which could be important for succeeding generations as well.

AB  - Leptin contributes to the control of food intake and energy balance. However, its association with appetitive behaviors during childhood is not well understood. We aimed to investigate the association between leptin, assessed at birth and at 7 years of age (y), and appetitive behaviors assessed at 7 and 10 y. Children from a Portuguese cohort with assessment of leptin levels at birth from umbilical cord blood (n = 645) and at 7 y from venous blood samples (n = 587), were included. The Children's Eating Behavior Questionnaire assessed appetitive behaviors at 7 and 10 y. Weight and height were measured at 7 and 10 y to derive BMI z-scores (BMIz). A series of Generalized Linear Models tested relationships between leptin and appetitive behaviors, adjusting for potential confounders (maternal age, education, pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking during pregnancy, child physical activity and child BMIz), and interaction terms for child sex and child BMIz. At 7 y, 116 boys and 118 girls were classified as having overweight/obesity, and these children had higher leptin levels. Cross-sectional analyses using the 7 y data produced the strongest results. Higher leptin at 7 y was significantly associated with lower scores on Satiety Responsiveness, Food Fussiness and Slowness in Eating, and higher scores on Food Responsiveness, Enjoyment of Food and Emotional Overeating at 7 y. Only the association with Emotional Overeating remained when adjusting for child BMIz. Significant interaction effects between child sex and leptin were found for appetite at 7 y, such that higher leptin was associated with higher Food Responsiveness (p < 0.001) and lower Slowness in Eating (p < 0.001) to a greater extent among boys. Umbilical cord blood leptin was not associated with appetitive behaviors at 7 or 10 y. Our results show that leptin levels are positively associated with food approach and negatively with food avoidant behaviors. Associations were more consistent in cross-sectional analyses (at 7 y), were largely dependent on child weight, and tended to be stronger among boys. Our findings support a role for leptin in affecting appetite, with potential consequences for current weight status and future weight gain. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: The growing epidemic of childhood obesity has forced scientists to search for methods to prevent feeding disorders. Increasing interest in appetite regulating hormones has revealed their influence on energy homeostasis after birth or even in utero., STATE OF KNOWLEDGE: The presence of ghrelin in the stomach of human foetuses and the distinctive production in the pancreas of neonates suggests the role of ghrelin in pre- and post-natal development. The neonatal period appears to be a critical time for the formation of adipose tissue-hypothalamus circuits, thus the amount of adipocytes in foetal life may be a major regulator of food intake. Insulin's orexigenic effect in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus can be a major modulator of foetal development., OBJECTIVE: This review, based on available literature, aims to analyses the role of appetite regulating hormones in foetal development., SUMMARY: Different concentrations of hormones, such as ghrelin, leptin and insulin during foetal life raises the question whether or not they can be modulated, thereby avoiding obesity before birth. Children with pancreas agenesis showed smaller body size at birth, which emphasises the probable role of insulin in foetal growth. Study of sheep foetuses with IUGR confirmed these finding. Appetite-regulating hormones show different roles in foetal development and seem to be essential in the perinatal period.

AB  - Adverse early nutrition leads to metabolic aberrations in adulthood. Molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible are emerging; specific nutritional causes remain unclarified. We investigated gestational dietary intake and its influences on metabolism in offspring. Three groups of pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed either AIN93G standard diet as control, isocaloric high fat sucrose diet or calorie restriction diet (50% of control) until delivery. All dams were fed control diet ad libitum during lactation. Offsprings' metabolic parameters were assessed at three weeks. Visceral fat and plasma triglycerides of high fat sucrose diet offspring were significantly higher than those of control diet and calorie restriction diet offspring. Plasma leptin level was higher in high fat sucrose diet than control offspring. Conversely, plasma adiponectin was lower in high fat sucrose diet and calorie restriction diet offspring compared to controls. Significant inductions of hepatic mRNA expression of stearoyl-CoA desaturase1 and DELTA-5 desaturase genes, were observed in high fat sucrose diet and calorie restriction diet offspring. Gestational high sugar and fat intake even without over energy intake would be more detrimental to metabolisms of offspring compared to calorie restriction.

AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious complication of pregnancy that is characterized by high blood sugar levels that occur due to insulin resistance and dysfunction in glucose metabolism during pregnancy. It usually develops in the second or third trimester of pregnancy and affects about 7 % of all pregnancies worldwide. In this experimental study, we scrutinized the GDM protective effect of soy isolate protein against streptozotocin (STZ) induced GDM in rats and explore the underlying mechanism.Material and methods: Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were used in this experimental study. A 55 mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of streptozotocin (STZ) was administered to induce diabetes in female rats, followed by oral administration of soy isolate protein for 18 days. Body weight, glucose levels, and insulin were measured at different time intervals (0, 9, and 18 days). Lipid profiles, antioxidant levels, inflammatory cytokines, apoptosis parameters, and mRNA expression were also assessed. Pancreatic and liver tissues were collected for histopathological examination during the experimental study.Results: Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) reduced the glucose level and enhanced the insulin level and body weight. Soy isolate protein remarkably decreased the placental weight and increased the fetal weight. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) decreased the HbA1c, hepatic glycogen, serum C-peptide and increased the level of free fatty acid. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) altered the level of lipid, antioxidant and inflammatory cytokines. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) improved the level of adiponectin, visfatin and suppressed the level of leptin and ICAM-1. Soy isolate protein significantly (P < 0.001) altered the mRNA expression and also restored the alteration of histopathology.Conclusion: Based on the result, soy isolate protein exhibited the GDM protective effect against the STZ induced GDM in rats via alteration of TLR4/MyD88/NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

AB  - Purpose of Review: To provide an up-to-date summary on the fetal risks associated with maternal obesity, specifically the risks of fetal anomalies, abnormal fetal growth, and stillbirth. Recent Findings: With the emerging data on fetal outcomes in individuals with the highest class of obesity, there is growing evidence that for many fetal adverse outcomes, there is a direct relationship between increasing maternal obesity class and the severity of the fetal outcome. Summary: Maternal obesity is associated with an increased risk of various fetal anomalies including fetal congenital cardiac disease, although there is a decreased risk of fetal gastroschisis. There is also an increased risk of both fetal macrosomia and fetal growth restriction in individuals with obesity. There is an approximately twofold increase in the risk of stillbirth in individuals with obesity. For many of these fetal risks, there is dose-response relationship between obesity class and severity of the fetal outcome. Fetal aneuploidy and sonographic screening strategies can be more challenging in individuals with obesity, which may contribute to under-detection and increased neonatal morbidity. At this time, prevention of these fetal risks is focused on prenatal weight optimization.Copyright © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: To explore the relationship between neonatal cord blood resistin, adiponectin, CD4 and CD8 and their influence on early neonatal outcomes. Objective(s): A total of 150 newborns delivered at term were selected as subjects to detect the levels of cord blood resistin, adiponectin, CD4 and CD8. The cases of neonatal asphyxia, respiratory distress, macrosomia and amniotic fluid inhalation syndrome were recorded. Result(s): There were 6 cases of high CD4 and 7 cases of low CD8 among the 150 newborns. There were 10 cases of macrosomia and 5 cases of respiratory distress. According to Pearson correlation analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in cord blood resistin between CD4 and CD8 in newborns delivered at term (r = 0.132, r = 0.098, P > 0.05). There was no significant difference between adiponectin, CD4 and CD8 (r = 0.104, r = 0.107, P > 0.05). There were 10 cases of macrosomia and 5 cases of respiratory distress in newborns, and there were no newborns with amniotic fluid inhalation syndrome and asphyxia. According to Pearson correlation analysis, cord blood resistin was negatively correlated with the body weight of large newborns and the level of neonatal respiratory distress (r = - 0.542, r = - 0.467, P < 0.05). Adiponectin levels were negatively correlated with the body weight of large newborns and neonatal respiratory distress (r = - 0.564, r = - 0.609, P < 0.05).The results of correlation analysis showed that the result of cord blood resistin was positively correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.612, P < 0.05). Conclusion(s): The level of cord blood resistin and adiponectin can measure fetal growth and development, and are closely related to neonatal early outcomes.Copyright © 2021, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) "program" an elevated risk of metabolic syndrome in the offspring. Epigenetic alterations are a suspected mechanism. GDM has been associated with placental DNA methylation changes in some epigenome-wide association studies. It remains unclear which genes or pathways are affected, and whether any placental differential gene methylations are correlated to fetal growth or circulating metabolic health biomarkers. In an epigenome-wide association study using the Infinium MethylationEPIC Beadchip, we sought to identify genome-wide placental differentially methylated genes and enriched pathways in GDM, and to assess the correlations with fetal growth and metabolic health biomarkers in cord blood. The study samples were 30 pairs of term placentas in GDM vs. euglycemic pregnancies (controls) matched by infant sex and gestational age at delivery in the Shanghai Birth Cohort. Cord blood metabolic health biomarkers included insulin, C-peptide, proinsulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, leptin and adiponectin. Adjusting for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, mode of delivery and placental cell type heterogeneity, 256 differentially methylated positions (DMPs,130 hypermethylated and 126 hypomethylated) were detected between GDM and control groups accounting for multiple tests with false discovery rate <0.05 and beta-value difference >0.05. WSCD2 was identified as a differentially methylated gene in both site- and region-level analyses. We validated 7 hypermethylated (CYP1A2, GFRA1, HDAC4, LIMS2, NAV3, PAX6, UPK1B) and 10 hypomethylated (DPP10, CPLX1, CSMD2, GPR133, NRXN1, PCSK9, PENK, PRDM16, PTPRN2, TNXB) genes reported in previous epigenome-wide association studies. We did not find any enriched pathway accounting for multiple tests. DMPs in 11 genes (CYP2D7P1, PCDHB15, ERG, SIRPB1, DKK2, RAPGEF5, CACNA2D4, PCSK9, TSNARE1, CADM2, KCNAB2) were correlated with birth weight (z score) accounting for multiple tests. There were no significant correlations between placental gene methylations and cord blood biomarkers. In conclusions, GDM was associated with DNA methylation changes in a number of placental genes, but these placental gene methylations were uncorrelated to the observed metabolic health biomarkers (fetal growth factors, leptin and adiponectin) in cord blood. We validated 17 differentially methylated placental genes in GDM, and identified 11 differentially methylated genes relevant to fetal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND Oral intake is dependent on the gastric ability to accommodate the food bolus. Comparatively, neonates have a smaller gastric capacity than adults and this may limit the volume of their milk intake. Yet, we previously reported that the newborn rat gastric milk volume is greatest after birth and, when normalized to body weight, decreases with postnatal age. Such age-dependent changes are not the result of intake differences, but greater gastric accommodation and reduced emptying rate. AIM Hypothesizing that breastmilk-derived adiponectin is the factor regulating gastric accommodation in neonates, we comparatively evaluated its effects on the rat fundic muscle tone at different postnatal ages. METHODS In freshly dispersed smooth muscle cells (SMC), we measured the adiponectin effect on the carbachol-induced length changes. RESULTS Adiponectin significantly reduced the carbachol-stimulated SMC shortening independently of age. In the presence of the inhibitor iberiotoxin, the adiponectin effect on SMC shortening was suppressed, suggesting that it is mediated via large-conductance Ca2+ sensitive K+ channel activation. Lastly, we comparatively measured the newborn rat gastric milk curd adiponectin content in one- and two-week-old rats and found a 50% lower value in the latter. CONCLUSION Adiponectin, a major component of breastmilk, downregulates fundic smooth muscle contraction potential, thus facilitating gastric volume accommodation. This rodent's adaptive response maximizes breastmilk intake volume after birth.

AB  - ABSTRACT: The present study was conducted with an attempt to explore the correlation of serum resistin level and other metabolic hormones and immune function in neonatal umbilical cord blood. The levels of umbilical cord blood resistin, adiponectin, insulin, growth hormone, leptin, thyrotropin, thyroid hormone (T3, T4), lgM, lgA, lgG, CD4, and CD8 were measured in 180 full-term newborns delivered in hospital from October 2018 to November 2019. The delivery mode, weight, height, and gender at birth were recorded. The levels of resistin, insulin, and growth hormone in umbilical cord blood of newborns delivered vaginally were significantly higher than those born by cesarean section (P < .05), while the levels of adiponectin, leptin, TST, T3, T4, lgM, lgA, lgG, CD4, and CD8 were comparable between the 2 groups (P > .05). The levels of resistin, adiponectin, insulin, growth hormone, leptin, TST, T3, T4, lgM, lgA, lgG, CD4, and CD8 in cord blood of male and female newborns were comparable (P > .05). The newborns with birth weight >= 3501 g reported comparable results in the levels of resistin and growth hormone compared with those with birth weight of 3000 to 3500 g (P > .05), but were significantly higher than those with birth weight <= 2999 g (P < 0.05). In addition, the levels of adiponectin, insulin, leptin, TST, T3, T4, lgM, lgA, lgG, CD4, and CD8 were comparable among the 3 groups (P > .05). Based on Pearson correlation analysis, neonatal umbilical cord blood resistin was positively correlated with adiponectin, leptin, growth hormone, T3, and T4 (r = 0.281, 0.287, 0.321, 0.276, 0.269, P < .05). However, there was no significant correlation between neonatal umbilical cord blood resistin and insulin, TST, lgM, lgA, lgG, CD4, and CD8. The level of serum resistin in neonatal umbilical cord blood was associated with the delivery mode and birth weight, and positively correlated with adiponectin, leptin, growth hormone, T3, and T4. However, no correlation was observed between serum resistin in neonatal umbilical cord blood and insulin, TST, lgM, lgA, lgG, CD4, and CD8. Copyright © 2021 the Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study insulin sensitivity and the serum level of adiponectin in infants with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and the effect of breastfeeding on the insulin sensitivity through a follow-up study., METHODS: A total of 106 full-term IUGR infants who were hospitalized from October 2014 to October 2018 were enrolled as the IUGR group, and 90 full-term appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants who were born during the same period of time were enrolled as the AGA group. Birth weight and body length were recorded. Serum levels of fasting blood glucose (FBG), triglyceride (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), insulin, and adiponectin were measured on day 7 after birth. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was calculated. According to the feeding pattern, the IUGR group was further divided into a breastfeeding group with 37 infants and a formula feeding group with 42 infants. The above serum indices and growth indices were also measured at the age of 3 and 6 months., RESULTS: Compared with the AGA group, the IUGR group had significantly increased levels in serum insulin and HOMA-IR and a significantly decreased level of adiponectin (P<0.05). There were no significant differences between the breastfeeding and formula feeding groups in growth indices and serum levels of FBG, TG, LDL, and HDL on day 7 after birth and at the ages of 3 and 6 months (P>0.05). In the breastfeeding group, serum insulin and HOMA-IR decreased and adiponectin level increased over the time of breastfeeding (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Insulin sensitivity decreases in the early stage after birth in IUGR infants, and breastfeeding can improve insulin sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We previously demonstrated an association between placental leptin (LEP) methylation levels and macrosomia without gestational diabetes mellitus (non-GDM). This study further explored the association between LEP methylation in cord blood and non-GDM macrosomia., METHOD: We carried out a case-control study of 61 newborns with macrosomia (birth weight >=4000 g) and 69 newborns with normal birth weight (2500-3999 g). Methylation in the LEP promoter region was mapped by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry., RESULTS: Average cord blood LEP methylation levels were lower in macrosomia newborns than in control newborns (P < 0.001). Eleven CpG sites were associated with macrosomia. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that low LEP methylation levels [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2.84, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.72-4.17], high pre-pregnancy body mass index (AOR = 7.44, 95% CI: 1.99-27.75), long gestational age (AOR = 3.18, 95% CI: 1.74-5.79), high cord blood LEP concentration (AOR = 2.25, 95% CI: 1.34-3.77), and male newborn gender (AOR = 3.91, 95% CI: 1.31-11.69) significantly increased the risk of macrosomia., CONCLUSIONS: Lower cord blood LEP methylation levels and certain maternal and fetal factors are associated with non-GDM macrosomia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) on insulin sensitivity in neonates and the relationship between insulin sensitivity and plasma adiponectin level., METHODS: Eighty-two term neonates with IUGR and 90 term neonates born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) were enrolled. Weight, height, head circumference and abdomen circumference of the neonates were measured within 24 hours after birth. Fasting serum glucose (FG), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), plasma insulin and adiponectin were detected in two groups on the 7th day after birth. Homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index and insulin sensitivity index (ISI) were calculated., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in the levels of FG, TG, HDL and LDL between the IUGR and AGA groups (P>0.05). The plasma insulin level in the IUGR group was higher than that in the AGA group, but the plasma adiponectin level was lower than that in the AGA group (P<0.05). HOMA-IR index in the IUGR group was higher than that in the AGA group, but ISI was lower than that in the AGA group (P<0.05). Both Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis showed HOMA-IR index was negatively correlated with plasma adiponectin level and birth weight (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The neonates with IUGR display a higher plasma insulin level and decreased insulin sensitivity. The decreased plasma adiponectin level may be associated with the decreased insulin sensitivity.

AB  - IMPORTANCE Previous reports have linked maternal prepregnancy obesity with low folate concentrations and child overweight or obesity (OWO) in separate studies. To our knowledge, the role of maternal folate concentrations, alone or in combination with maternal OWO, in child metabolic health has not been examined in a prospective birth cohort. OBJECTIVE To test the hypotheses that maternal folate concentrations can significantly affect child metabolic health and that sufficient maternal folate concentrations can mitigate prepregnancy obesity-induced child metabolic risk. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective birth cohort study was conducted at the Boston Medical Center, Boston, Massachusetts. It included 1517 mother-child dyads recruited at birth from 1998 to 2012 and followed up prospectively up to 9 years from 2003 to 2014. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Child body mass index z score calculated according to US reference data, OWO defined as a body mass index in the 85th percentile or greater for age and sex, and metabolic biomarkers (leptin, insulin, and adiponectin). RESULTS The mean (SD) age was 28.6 (6.5) years for mothers and 6.2 (2.4) years for the children. An L-shaped association between maternal folate concentrations and child OWO was observed: the risk for OWO was higher among those in the lowest quartile (Q1) as compared with those in Q2 through Q4, with an odds ratio of 1.45 (95% CI, 1.13-1.87). The highest risk for child OWO was found among children of obese mothers with low folate concentrations (odds ratio, 3.05; 95% CI, 1.91-4.86) compared with children of normal-weight mothers with folate concentrations in Q2 through Q4 after accounting for multiple covariables. Among children of obese mothers, their risk for OWO was associated with a 43% reduction (odds ratio, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.34-0.95) if their mothers had folate concentrations in Q2 through Q4 compared with Q1. Similar patterns were observed for child metabolic biomarkers. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this urban low-income prospective birth cohort, we demonstrated an L-shaped association between maternal plasma folate concentrations and child OWO and the benefit of sufficient folate concentrations, especially among obese mothers. The threshold concentration identified in this study exceeded the clinical definition of folate deficiency, which was primarily based on the hematological effect of folate. Our findings underscore the need to establish optimal rather than minimal folate concentrations for preventing adverse metabolic outcomes in the offspring.

AB  - Over the past two decades, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used for diagnosis in gestational women. Though it has several advantages, animal and human studies on the safety of MRI for the fetus remain inconclusive. Epigenetic modifications, which are crucial for cellular functioning, are prone to being affected by environmental changes. Therefore, we hypothesized that MRI during gestation may cause epigenetic modification alterations. Here, we investigated DNA methylation patterns of leptin promoter in the placenta and cord blood of women exposed to MRI during gestation. Results showed that average methylation levels of leptin in the placenta and cord blood were not affected by MRI. We also found that the methylation levels in the placenta and cord blood were not affected by different magnetic fields (1.5T and 3.0T MRI). However, if pregnant women were exposed to MRI at 15 to 20 weeks of gestation, the methylation level of leptin in cord blood was visibly lower than that of pregnant women exposed to MRI after 20-weeks of gestation (P = 0.037). mRNA expression level of leptin in cord blood was also altered, though mRNA expression of leptin in the placenta was not significantly affected. Therefore, we concluded that gestational MRI may not have major effects on the methylation level of leptin in cord blood and the placenta except for MRI applied before 20 weeks of gestation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine serum adiponectin level in preterm infants and to evaluate the relationship between serum adiponectin and bone mineral density in preterm infants., METHODS: Seventy-two appropriate-for-gestational-age neonates were classified into three groups according to their gestational ages: early preterm (31-33(+6) weeks, 13 cases), late preterm (34-36(+6) weeks, 16 cases), and full-term (37-42 weeks, 43 cases). Venous blood was collected at one week of their life to measure serum adiponectin concentration. During the period, omnisense ultrasound bone sonometer was applied to measure speed of sound (SOS) of the left tibia., RESULTS: The median of tibia SOS in the early preterm group was significantly lower than in the late preterm and full term groups (P<0.05), and the median of tibia SOS in the late preterm group was lower than in the full-term group (P<0.05). Serum adiponectin level was lowest in the early preterm group, and the full-term group had the highest serum adiponectin level. Serum adiponectin level was positively correlated with tibia SOS in preterm infants (r=0.664, P<0.05). According to the result of multivariate linear stepwise regression analysis, serum adiponectin and birth weight were independent predictor of tibia SOS in preterm infants., CONCLUSIONS: Serum adiponectin level is lower in preterm infants than that in full-term infants. There is a positive correlation between serum adiponectin and bone mineral density in preterm infants.

AB  - Leptin regulates maternal metabolism and fetal growth by reducing food intake and increasing energy expenditure, particularly during the third trimester. In this study, we investigated the relationships between leptin and growth, and explored the longitudinal change of leptin in early postnatal life. A total of 58 infants were categorized according to gestational length and birth weight. Arterial blood samples were taken within 24 hours (Day 1), and on Days 4 and 7 of life. Plasma leptin levels were measured by commercial human leptin enzyme immunometric assay. The average serum leptin level declined in the first week of life. There was a positive correlation between leptin level and body weight on Day 4. Neonates with leptin decrease between Day 1 and Day 4 had better weight gain at one year old, and the hospital stay day was shorter. Furthermore, the full feeding days and the duration of feeding priming and full feeding days in the leptin decrease group were less than in the leptin increase group. Serum leptin was significantly decreased and positively correlated with neonates' body weight gain in the first week of life. A rapid decline in serum leptin after birth is associated with greater future weight gain and physiological advantage for infants' life. Copyright © 2012. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the variation of human breast milk adiponectin (APN) concentration during lactation, analyze the relationship of APN concentrations in human breast milk with APN in infant serum, determine the association between maternal milk APN and infant body proportionality in the first year of life, and the period of greatest human milk exposure., METHOD: Subjects included 73 mother-infant pairs from Shanghai International Peace Maternity & Child Health Hospital. Maternal milk was collected at 2, 4, 13, 26 weeks and infant serum was collected at 26 weeks. The concentration of APN in maternal milk and infant serum were measured with commercially available ELISAs (R&D Systems). Weight-for-age Z-scores (WAZ), length-for-age Z-scores (LAZ), weight-for-length Z-scores (WLZ) and body mass index Z-scores (zBMI) of infants up to 1 year of age were calculated using World Health Organization (WHO) standards. Then the variation of maternal milk APN was investigated, the correlation between maternal milk APN and infant serum APN was analyzed; multivariate regression analysis was used to analyze covariates correlated with infant body proportionality, meanwhile determined the association between maternal milk APN and infant anthropometrics., RESULT: The concentration of APN in maternal milk at 2, 4, 13, 26 weeks was respectively (14.62 microg/L, 5.93 - 140.40 microg/L), (7.32 microg/L, 2.04 - 29.35 microg/L), (6.84 microg/L, 2.72 - 15.65 microg/L) and (4.88 microg/L, 1.12 - 13.38 microg/L). Higher milk APN in postpartum 2 weeks was associated with lower infant WAZ at 13, 26 and 52 weeks (P < 0.05). Milk APN in postpartum 4 weeks was inversely related to infant WAZ, WLZ, zBMI at 13, 26 and 52 weeks (all P < 0.05). Meanwhile, milk APN in postpartum 13 weeks had significantly negative correlation with infant WAZ, WLZ, zBMI at 13, 26 and 52 weeks (P < 0.01). Milk APN in postpartum 26 weeks also was inversely associated with infant WAZ, WLZ and zBMI at 52 weeks (P < 0.05). After adjusting covariates like birth weight using multivariate regression analysis, milk APN level is the most important influence factor to infant WAZ, WLZ, zBMI at 13, 26 and 52 weeks. There was a positive correlation between maternal milk APN and infant serum APN at 13, 26 weeks., CONCLUSION: Milk APN concentration declines throughout lactation. Maternal milk APN may play a vital role in the growth and development of breastfed infants, particularly closely associated with infant weight. Infant serum APN clearly correlated with maternal milk APN.

AB  - Multiple pregnancies are thought to be associated with a high incidence of perinatal complications such as preterm labor, preeclampsia and low birth weight. But the true mechanisms of these obstetric complications are still uncertain. The components of amniotic fluid reflect the pathophysiology features of the fetus. Amniotic fluid soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1(sFLT1), soluble endoglin (sENG), and adiponectin reflect the oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status and are associated with preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. We prospectively collected amniotic fluids during amniocentesis from singleton and twin pregnancies. Samples were analyzed for levels of sFLT1, sENG, and adiponectin by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of sENG and sFLT1 were significantly increased in twin pregnancies. Adiponectin was not significantly different between the two groups. These findings would suggest that twin fetuses suffer from more oxidative stress and pro-inflammatory status from the early trimesters.

AB  - Aim: Adiponectin and resistin are novel hormones secreted by human adipocytes and mononuclear cells, which have been postulated to play roles in the regulation of energy metabolism during pregnancy. However, correlations between adiponectin and resistin levels in umbilical and maternal serum and fetal macrosomia remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship of adiponectin and resistin levels in umbilical and maternal serum with fetal macrosomia. Methods: Serum adiponectin and resistin levels were prospectively measured by enzyme immunoassay in 70 mothers and their 70 neonates. The study group included 30 neonates with macrosomia and the control group included 40 neonates that were appropriate for gestational age. The correlations of cord serum adiponectin and resistin with maternal serum adiponectin and resistin, birth weight, body mass index (BMI), and placental weight were analyzed. Results: Serum adiponectin and resistin levels were significantly decreased in macrosomic mothers compared with those in control women. The levels of adiponectin and resistin were diminished in macrosomic babies in comparison with control newborns. Umbilical serum adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with birth weight, newborn BMI, and placental weight, but not with maternal serum adiponectin levels. Umbilical serum resistin levels had a positive correlation with maternal serum resistin and a negative correlation with birth weight, newborn BMI, and placental weight. In addition, maternal serum resistin levels were inversely correlated with newborn birth weight.

AB  - AIM: Adiponectin and resistin are novel hormones secreted by human adipocytes and mononuclear cells, which have been postulated to play roles in the regulation of energy metabolism during pregnancy. However, correlations between adiponectin and resistin levels in umbilical and maternal serum and fetal macrosomia remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship of adiponectin and resistin levels in umbilical and maternal serum with fetal macrosomia., METHODS: Serum adiponectin and resistin levels were prospectively measured by enzyme immunoassay in 70 mothers and their 70 neonates. The study group included 30 neonates with macrosomia and the control group included 40 neonates that were appropriate for gestational age. The correlations of cord serum adiponectin and resistin with maternal serum adiponectin and resistin, birth weight, body mass index (BMI), and placental weight were analyzed., RESULTS: Serum adiponectin and resistin levels were significantly decreased in macrosomic mothers compared with those in control women. The levels of adiponectin and resistin were diminished in macrosomic babies in comparison with control newborns. Umbilical serum adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with birth weight, newborn BMI, and placental weight, but not with maternal serum adiponectin levels. Umbilical serum resistin levels had a positive correlation with maternal serum resistin and a negative correlation with birth weight, newborn BMI, and placental weight. In addition, maternal serum resistin levels were inversely correlated with newborn birth weight., CONCLUSION: It is suggested that adiponectin and resistin play important roles in controlling body weight and may be related to the occurrence of fetal macrosomia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin and resistin have been postulated to play a role in the regulation of energy metabolism during pregnancy. However, relationship of adiponectin and resistin levels in umbilical serum, maternal serum and placenta with neonatal birth weight remains to be poorly understood. The purpose of the study was to clarify the correlations between adiponectin and resistin levels and neonatal birth weight., METHODS: Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the adiponectin and resistin levels in maternal and umbilical serum from 40 normal pregnant women (control group), 30 women with macrosomia (macrosomia group) and 30 women with fetal growth restriction (FGR group). Immunohistochemistry was used to measure adiponectin and resistin levels in placenta., RESULTS: Serum adiponectin and resistin levels were significantly increased in control women compared with that in macrosomia mothers, but significantly decreased compared with that in FGR mothers. The levels of adiponectin and resistin in control babies were significantly higher than that in macrosomic babies, whereas significantly lower than that in FGR babies. The placental expressions of adiponectin and resistin in macrosomia, control and FGR group were gradually elevated, and there was a significant difference between them. Umbilical serum adiponectin levels and placental adiponectin expression were inversely correlated with birth weight. Umbilical serum levels and placental expression of resistin had positive correlation with maternal serum resistin and negative correlation with birth weight. In addition, maternal serum resistin levels were inversely correlated with birth weight., CONCLUSION: It is suggested that adiponectin and resistin play an important role in controlling body weight and may be related to the occurrence of fetal macrosomia and FGR.

AB  - CONTEXT: The cause of preeclampsia remains unknown. Excessive antiangiogenic proteins have been proposed to play a pathogenic role in preeclampsia., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the differences in soluble endoglin (sEndoglin), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1 (sFLT1), leptin, adiponectin, and endothelin 1 concentrations between normal and preeclampsia amniotic fluid (AF). Such results may help us understand the pathophysiology of preeclampsia., METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study. Seventy-one women with preeclampsia were matched to 71 normotensive controls. The preeclamptic women were broken into two subgroups according to the association with fetal intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). AF concentrations of sEndoglin, sFLT1, leptin, adiponectin, and endothelin 1 were measured by ELISA. Receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis was used to compare the discriminative values of these potential biomarkers. Functional network analysis was performed using MetaCore to reveal the common functions of the interacting proteins., RESULTS: Increased AF concentrations of sFLT1, sEndoglin, endothelin 1, and leptin were found in women who later developed preeclampsia. sFLT1, sEndoglin, leptin, and adiponectin were significantly higher in the preeclampsia with IUGR than those without IUGR. Leptin has the largest area under the curve (0.753). Network analysis revealed that elevated amniotic proteins are involved in the inflammatory process of the human placenta., CONCLUSIONS: Significant elevation of leptin can be detected in AF 2 months earlier than the appearance of symptoms; thus, it may be used as a predictive marker for preeclampsia. The increase of these antiangiogenic proteins supports the roles of inflammation and oxidative stress in pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recent research has shown that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) can improve obesity. This study aimed to explore the relationship between BDNF and birth weight by measuring BDNF levels in the umbilical cord blood of neonates., METHODS: Based on birth weight, 51 first-born full-term healthy neonates were classified into 3 groups: small for gestational age (SGA, n=8), appropriate for gestational age (AGA, n=31) and large for gestational age (LGA, n=12). Height and birth weight as well as umbilical concentrations of BDNF, leptin, insulin, total cholesterol and triglyceride were determined., RESULTS: BDNF level in the SGA group (19980.00 +/- 5470.54 pg/mL) was significantly higher than that in the AGA (10598.00 +/- 6295.71 pg/mL) and LGA (7508.57 +/- 3767.81 pg/mL) groups (P <0.05). There was no significant difference in the BDNF level between the AGA and LGA groups. Stepwise regression analysis showed that the value of BDNF was negatively correlated with birth weight and BMI of neonates, but had no correlation with leptin and insulin levels. Leptin levels showed positive correlations with birth weight and BMI of neonates. There were no significant differences in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels among the three groups., CONCLUSIONS: BDNF is closely correlated to birth weight but not correlated with leptin and insulin in neonates.

AB  - Adiponectin is an adipokine that has pleiotropic beneficial roles in systemic insulin resistance and inflammation. Several recent clinical studies suggest that low serum levels of adiponectin are associated with increased risks of breast cancer. Here, we investigated the direct effects of adiponectin on breast cancer development in vitro and in vivo. Our results showed that adiponectin significantly attenuated the proliferations of two typical human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-231 and T47D, in a cell type-specific manner. Further analysis revealed that adiponectin could induce apoptosis and arrest the cell cycle progression at G(0)-G(1) phase in MDA-MB-231 cells. Prolonged treatment with adiponectin in this cell line blocked serum-induced phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta), suppressed intracellular accumulation of beta-catenin and its nuclear activities, and consequently reduced expression of cyclin D1. Adiponectin-mediated suppression of cyclin D1 expression and attenuation of cell proliferation was abrogated by the GSK-3beta inhibitor lithium chloride. These results suggest that the inhibitory role of adiponectin on MDA-MB-231 cell growth might be attributed to its suppressive effects on the GSK-3beta/beta-catenin signaling pathway. Furthermore, our in vivo study showed that both supplementation of recombinant adiponectin and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of this adipokine substantially reduced the mammary tumorigenesis of MDA-MB-231 cells in female nude mice. Taken together, these data support the role of adiponectin as a negative regulator of breast cancer development and also suggest that adiponectin might represent a novel therapeutic target for this disease.

AB  - Background: Gut microbiota of pregnant women change with the gestational week. On the one hand, they participate in the metabolic adaptation of pregnant women. On the other hand, the abnormal composition of gut microbiota of pregnant women is more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Therefore, gut microbiota targeted treatment through dietary supplements is particularly important for prevention or treatment. Prebiotic supplements containing galactooligosaccharides (GOS) may be an intervention method, but the effect is still unclear. Objective(s): This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of prebiotic intervention in healthy pregnant women during pregnancy, and to explore the possible effects of intervention on pregnant women and the influence on gut microbiota as preliminaries. Method(s): After recruitment in first trimester, 52 pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive GOS intervention or placebo containing fructooligosaccharides. 16S rRNA sequencing technology was used to detect the composition, diversity and differential flora of gut microbiota. Lipid metabolism, glucose metabolism and inflammatory factors during pregnancy were also analyzed. Result(s): The adverse symptoms of GOS intervention are mild and relatively safe. For pregnant women, there was no significant difference in the GDM incidence rates and gestational weight gain (GWG) in the GOS group compared with placebo (P > 0.05). Compared with the placebo group, the levels of FPG, TG, TC, HDL-C LDL-C, and IL-6 had no significant difference in GOS group (P > 0.05). For newborns, there was no significant difference between GOS group and placebo group in the following variables including gestational week, birth weight, birth length, head circumference, chest circumference, sex, and delivery mode (P > 0.05). And compared with the placebo group, the GOS group had a higher abundance of Paraprevotella and Dorea, but lower abundance of LachnospiraceaeUCG_001. Conclusion(s): GOS prebiotics appear to be safe and acceptable for the enrolled pregnancies. Although GOS intervention did not show the robust benefits on glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the intervention had a certain impact on the compostion of gut microbiota. GOS can be considered as a dietary supplement during pregnancy, and further clinical studies are needed to explore this in the future.Copyright © 2023 Wan, An, Ren, Wang, Yang and Ma.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Childhood obesity is increasing worldwide and is increasingly associated with metabolic syndrome (MetS). Our aim was to examine acylation stimulating protein (ASP) and its precursor complement C3, in normal, overweight, and obese Chinese children and adolescents, and the relationships with body size, blood parameters, pubertal development, family environment, and MetS., METHODS: Children and adolescents (n=1603) from 6 to 18 years, boys (n=873) and girls (n=730), including normal weight (n=603), overweight (n=291) and obese (n=709) were assessed for body size parameters, pubertal development, blood lipids, glucose, insulin, ASP, and C3., RESULTS: ASP levels were increased in overweight and obese versus normal weight (P<0.001), while C3 showed little variation. This effect of overweight/obesity remained throughout early stages when boys and girls were separated by pubertal development or age, although age and pubertal status itself had no effect. Separation based on ASP quintiles demonstrated significant associations with blood cholesterol, triglyceride, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-Chol), glucose, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance in boys, and LDL-Chol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and glucose in girls. A positive correlation with mother's body mass index in boys and girls (P=0.002 and P=0.014 respectively) as well as birth weight (P<0.001) was noted. MetS was strongly associated with increased ASP, the presence of a single MetS factor (especially hypertension, central obesity, or hyperglycemia) was associated with increased ASP., CONCLUSION: Changes in the plasma adipokine ASP in early obesity are associated with blood lipid and glucose modifications, family environment, and distinct MetS risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gender plays a role in the development of a number of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases and it has been suggested that females may be more insulin resistant in utero. We sought to assess the relationship between infant gender and insulin resistance in a large pregnancy cohort., STUDY DESIGN: This is a secondary analysis of a cohort from the ROLO randomized control trial of low GI diet in pregnancy. Serum insulin, glucose and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks. At delivery cord blood C-peptide and leptin were measured. A comparison of maternal factors, fetal biometry, insulin resistance and leptin was made between male and female offspring. A multivariate regression model was built to account for the possible effects of maternal BMI, birthweight and original study group assignment on findings., RESULTS: A total of 582 women were included in this secondary analysis, of whom 304 (52.2%) gave birth to male and 278 (47.8%) gave birth to female infants. Compared to male infants at birth, female infants were significantly lighter, (3945 +/- 436 vs. 4081+/- 549g, p<0.001), shorter in length (52.36 +/- 2.3 vs. 53.05 +/- 2.4cm, p<0.001) and with smaller head circumferences (35.36 +/- 1.5 vs. 36.10 +/- 1.1cm, p<0.001) than males. On multiple regression analysis, women pregnant with female fetuses were less insulin resistant in early pregnancy, i.e. had lower HOMA indices (B = -0.19, p = 0.01). Additionally female fetuses had higher concentrations of both cord blood leptin and C-peptide at birth when compared to male offspring (B = 0.38, p<0.001 and B = 0.31, p = 0.03 respectively)., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest gender is a risk factor for insulin resistance in-utero. Additionally, carrying a female fetus decreases the risk of insulin resistance in the mother, from as early as the first trimester.

AB  - This is a secondary analysis of 621 women in ROLO study, a randomized control trial of low glycemic index (GI) diet in pregnancy to prevent the recurrence of macrosomia, which aims to assess the effect of the diet on maternal and fetal insulin resistance, leptin, and markers of inflammation. In early pregnancy and at 28 weeks, serum was analyzed for insulin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6). At delivery, cord blood concentrations of leptin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, and C-peptide were recorded. We found no difference between those who did or did not receive low GI advice with respect to the concentrations of any marker in early pregnancy, at 28 weeks or in cord blood. Women in the intervention arm of the study did have a lower overall rise in insulin concentrations from early pregnancy to 28 weeks gestation, P = .04. Of the women in the intervention arm, 20% were in the highest quartile for insulin change (28-week insulin - insulin at booking) compared to 29% of controls (P = .02). In conclusion, a low GI diet in pregnancy has little effect on leptin and markers of inflammation although an attenuated response to the typical increase in insulin resistance seen in pregnancy with advancing gestation was seen in those who received the low GI advice.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interrogation of the association between leptin, insulin resistance and fetal growth may provide a biological link for the fetal programming of later metabolic health., AIMS: Our aim was to clarify the relationship between maternal and fetal leptin, insulin resistance and fetal growth., STUDY DESIGN: Maternal leptin, glucose and insulin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28weeks and the HOMA index calculated. At 34weeks, ultrasound scan assessed fetal weight and adiposity (abdominal wall width). At delivery birthweight was recorded and cord blood analyzed for fetal c-peptide and leptin. Analysis was performed using a multivariate linear regression model., SUBJECTS: 574 non-diabetic pregnant women., OUTCOME MEASURES: Fetal growth and maternal and fetal insulin resistance., RESULTS: On multivariate analysis a relationship was identified between maternal and fetal leptin concentrations at each time point and maternal body mass index. Maternal leptin was related to insulin resistance in early pregnancy (beta=0.15, p=0.02) and at 28week gestation (beta=0.27, p<0.001). Fetal insulin resistance correlated with maternal leptin in early pregnancy (beta=0.17, p=0.004); at 28weeks (beta=0.12, p=0.05), and with leptin in cord blood (r=0.28, p<0.001). Fetal weight at 34weeks was related to maternal leptin in early pregnancy (beta=0.16, p=0.02). Both maternal and fetal leptin correlated with infant size at birth (beta=0.12, p=0.07 in early pregnancy, beta=0.21, p=0.004 in cord blood), independent of all other outcome measures., CONCLUSION: Our findings have confirmed that in a non-diabetic cohort there is a link between maternal and fetal leptin and insulin resistance. We also established a link between maternal leptin in early pregnancy and both fetal and neonatal size. These results add to the growing body of evidence suggesting a role for leptin in the fetal programming of childhood obesity and metabolic dysfunction. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal characteristics, obstetric outcomes and insulin resistance in a cohort of women subdivided into those who did and those who did not exceed the Institute of Medicine (IOM) gestational weight gain guidelines., METHODS: This is a prospective study of 621 women without diabetes. Concentrations of glucose, insulin and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks. Ultrasound at 34 weeks assessed fetal anthropometry including abdominal wall width (AAW). At delivery birthweight was recorded and fetal glucose, C-peptide and leptin measured in cord blood. Insulin resistance was calculated using the HOMA equation. Outcomes in those who did and did not exceed IOM guidelines were compared., RESULTS: Overall, 267 women (43%) exceeded IOM guidelines and 354 (57%) did not. On 34-week ultrasound women with excessive weight gain had higher fetal weights (2681 +/- 356 g vs. 2574 +/- 331, P = 0.001) and fetal adiposity (AAW) (5.29 +/- 1.3 vs. 4.8 +/- 1.2, P = 0.001). Infant birthweight and birthweight centiles were also higher in those who exceeded the guidelines. There was no difference between the two groups in maternal insulin resistance in early pregnancy, but by 28 weeks those with excessive weight gain had higher maternal HOMA indices and higher maternal leptin concentrations., CONCLUSION: Excessive maternal gestational weight gain has significant implications for infant growth and adiposity, with potential implications for later adult health.

AB  - The present study is a secondary analysis of the ROLO study, a randomised control trial of a low-glycaemic index (GI) diet in pregnancy to prevent the recurrence of fetal macrosomia. The objectives of the present study were to identify which women are most likely to respond to a low-GI dietary intervention in pregnancy with respect to three outcome measures: birth weight; maternal glucose intolerance; gestational weight gain (GWG). In early pregnancy, 372 women had their mid-upper arm circumference recorded and BMI calculated. Concentrations of glucose, insulin and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks. At delivery, infant birth weight was recorded and fetal glucose, C-peptide and leptin concentrations were measured in the cord blood. Women who benefited in terms of infant birth weight were shorter, with a lower education level. Those who maintained weight gain within the GWG guidelines were less overweight in both their first and second pregnancies, with no difference being observed in maternal height. Women who at 28 weeks of gestation developed glucose intolerance, despite the low-GI diet, had a higher BMI and higher glucose concentrations in early pregnancy with more insulin resistance. They also had significantly higher-interval pregnancy weight gain. For each analysis, women who responded to the intervention had lower leptin concentrations in early pregnancy than those who did not. These findings suggest that the maternal metabolic environment in early pregnancy is important in determining later risks of excessive weight gain and metabolic disturbance, whereas birth weight is mediated more by genetic factors. It highlights key areas, which warrant further interrogation before future pregnancy intervention studies, in particular, maternal education level and inter-pregnancy weight gain.

AB  - Evidence for a role of vitamin D in maintaining normal glucose homeostasis is inconclusive. We sought to clarify the relationship between maternal and fetal insulin resistance and vitamin D status. This is a prospective cohort study of 60 caucasian pregnant women. Concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD), glucose, insulin, and leptin were measured in early pregnancy and at 28 weeks. Ultrasound at 34 weeks assessed fetal anthropometry including abdominal wall width, a marker of fetal adiposity. At delivery birth weight was recorded and fetal 25-OHD, glucose, C-peptide, and leptin measured in cord blood. Insulin resistance was calculated using the Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA) equation. We found that those with lower 25-OHD in early pregnancy had higher HOMA indices at 28 weeks, (r = -.32, P = .02). No significant relationship existed between maternal or fetal leptin and 25-OHD, or between maternal or fetal 25-OHD and fetal anthropometry or birth weight. The incidence of vitamin D deficiency was high at each time point (15%-45%). These findings lend support to routine antenatal supplementation with vitamin D in at risk populations.

AB  - Adipose tissue development begins in utero and is a key target of developmental programming. Here the influence of nutritionally-mediated prenatal growth-restriction on perirenal adipose tissue (PAT) gene expression and adipocyte phenotype in late fetal life was investigated in both sexes in an ovine model. Likewise circulating leptin concentrations and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) and glycerol responses to glucose challenge were determined in relation to offspring adiposity at key stages from birth to mid-adult life. In both studies' singleton-bearing adolescent sheep were fed control or high nutrient intakes to induce normal or growth-restricted pregnancies, respectively. Fetal growth-restriction at day 130 of gestation (32% lighter) was characterised by greater body-weight-specific PAT mass and higher PAT expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR.), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor, and uncoupling protein 1. Independent of prenatal growth, females had a greater body-weight-specific PAT mass, more multilocular adipocytes, higher leptin and lower insulin-like growth factor 1 mRNA than males. Growth-restricted offspring of both sexes (42% lighter at birth) were characterised by higher plasma NEFA concentrations across the life-course (post-fasting and after glucose challenge at 7, 32, 60, 85 and 106 weeks of age) consistent with reduced adipose tissue insulin sensitivity. Circulating plasma leptin correlated with body fat percentage (females> males) and restricted compared with normal females had more body fat and increased abundance of PPAR.;, HSL, leptin and adiponectin mRNA in PAT at necropsy (109 weeks). Therefore, prenatal nutrient supply and sex both influence adipose tissue development with consequences for lipid metabolism and body composition persisting throughout the life-course.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a risk factor for obesity, particularly when offspring are born into an unrestricted nutritional environment. In this study, we investigated the impact of IUGR and gender on circulating lipids and on expression of adipogenic, lipogenic and adipokine genes in perirenal adipose tissue. Singleton lambs born to overnourished adolescent dams were normal birth weight (N) or IUGR (32% lower birth weight due to placental insufficiency). IUGR lambs exhibited increased fractional growth rates but remained smaller than N lambs at necropsy (d77). At 48 days, fasting plasma triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids and glycerol were elevated predominantly in IUGR males. Body fat content was independent of prenatal growth but higher in females than in males. In perirenal fat, relative to male lambs, females had larger adipocytes; higher lipoprotein lipase, fatty acid synthase and leptin and lower IGF1, IGF2, IGF1R, IGF2R and hormone-sensitive lipase mRNA expression levels, and all were independent of prenatal growth category; peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH) mRNA expression were not affected by IUGR or gender. Adiposity indices were inversely related to G3PDH mRNA expression, and for the population as a whole the expression of IGF system genes in perirenal fat was negatively correlated with plasma leptin, fat mass and adipocyte size, and positively correlated with circulating IGF1 levels. Higher plasma lipid levels in IUGR males may predict later adverse metabolic health and obesity, but in early postnatal life gender has the dominant influence on adipose tissue gene expression, reflecting the already established sexual dimorphism in body composition.

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors, including the in utero environment, contribute to Metabolic Syndrome. Exposure to high fat diet exposure in utero and lactation increases incidence of Metabolic Syndrome in offspring. Using GLUT4 heterozygous (G4+/-) mice, genetically predisposed to Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, and wild-type littermates we demonstrate genotype specific differences to high fat in utero and lactation. High fat in utero and lactation increased adiposity and impaired insulin and glucose tolerance in both genotypes. High fat wild type offspring had increased serum glucose and PAI-1 levels and decreased adiponectin at 6 wks of age compared to control wild type. High fat G4+/- offspring had increased systolic blood pressure at 13 wks of age compared to all other groups. Potential fetal origins of adult Metabolic Syndrome were investigated. Regardless of genotype, high fat in utero decreased fetal weight and crown rump length at embryonic day 18.5 compared to control. Hepatic expression of genes involved in glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, oxidative stress and inflammation were increased with high fat in utero. Fetal serum glucose levels were decreased in high fat G4+/- compared to high fat wild type fetuses. High fat G4+/-, but not high fat wild type fetuses, had increased levels of serum cytokines (IFN-gamma, MCP-1, RANTES and M-CSF) compared to control. This data demonstrates that high fat during pregnancy and lactation increases Metabolic Syndrome male offspring and that heterozygous deletion of GLUT4 augments susceptibility to increased systolic blood pressure. Fetal adaptations to high fat in utero that may predispose to Metabolic Syndrome in adulthood include changes in fetal hepatic gene expression and alterations in circulating cytokines. These results suggest that the interaction between in utero-perinatal environment and genotype plays a critical role in the developmental origin of health and disease.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The developmental origins of health and disease theory states that a disturbance in the early life environment can contribute to disease risk in later life. Leptin and insulin are anorectic hormones involved in energy homeostasis and are crucial for foetal growth. Disturbances in the levels of these hormones contribute to obesity and diabetes. In adults, altered mitochondrial function is an important hallmark of metabolic disorders, including obesity and diabetes. However, the mitochondrial effects of early life metabolic variation are unexplored. We investigated whether there is an association between metabolic hormones and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content in early life., METHODS: The study included 236 newborns from the FLEHS III birth cohort, Flanders (Belgium). Relative mtDNA content of cord blood leukocytes was determined using quantitative PCR. Cord blood levels of leptin and insulin were determined using immunoassays. We studied the association between these metabolic hormones and mtDNA content using multiple linear regression models, while accounting for covariates and potential confounders., RESULTS: Leptin and insulin levels were positively associated with cord blood mtDNA content. mtDNA content was respectively 4.49% (95% CI 1.15-7.93; p = 0.008) and 1.60% (95% CI 0.31-2.91; p = 0.02) higher for a interquartile range increase of respectively cord blood leptin and insulin levels. In a sensitivity analysis, we observed that insulin and leptin were independently associated to mtDNA content and that insulin was stronger associated to mtDNA content in boys than in girls., CONCLUSION: Neonatal metabolic hormones were associated with cord blood mtDNA content, which suggests that in early life the variation of mtDNA content might accommodate or reflect changes in the metabolic status.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Fetal growth disturbances place fetuses at increased risk for perinatal morbidity and mortality. As yet, little is known about the basic pathogenetic mechanisms underlying deranged fetal growth. Apelin is an adipokine with several biological activities. Over the past decade, it has been investigated for its possible role in fetal growth restriction. Most studies have examined apelin concentrations in maternal serum and amniotic fluid in the third trimester or during neonatal life. In this study, apelin concentrations were examined for the first time in early second-trimester fetuses. Another major regulator of tissue growth and metabolism is insulin., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective observational cohort study. We measured apelin and insulin concentrations in the amniotic fluid of 80 pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis in the early second trimester. Amniotic fluid samples were stored in appropriate conditions until delivery. The study groups were then defined, i.e., gestations with different fetal growth patterns (SGA, AGA, and LGA). Measurements were made using ELISA kits., RESULTS: Apelin and insulin levels were measured in all 80 samples. The analysis revealed statistically significant differences in apelin concentrations among groups (p = 0.007). Apelin concentrations in large for gestational age (LGA) fetuses were significantly lower compared to those in AGA and SGA fetuses. Insulin concentrations did not differ significantly among groups., CONCLUSIONS: A clear trend towards decreasing apelin concentrations as birthweight progressively increased was identified. Amniotic fluid apelin concentrations in the early second trimester may be useful as a predictive factor for determining the risk of a fetus being born LGA. Future studies are expected/needed to corroborate the present findings and should ideally focus on the potential interplay of apelin with other known intrauterine metabolic factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common inherited disorder of adrenal steroid biosynthesis. Patients with the classic form of CAH show androgen excess, with or without salt wasting. There are few studies reporting on higher rates of overweight and obesity among children with CAH. In addition to its role in the regulation of energy balance, leptin is involved in various endocrine and metabolic pathways. In this context, elevated serum leptin levels were reported recently for patients with CAH and were thought to be involved in the development of obesity among these patients. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analyze BMI values, compared with population-based references, for children and adolescents with CAH. Possible contributing factors, such as glucocorticoid therapy, skeletal maturation, birth weight and length, and parental BMI, were correlated with current BMI SD scores (SDS). In addition, the implications of serum leptin levels, corrected for BMI, gender, and Tanner stage, were investigated., METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional retrospective study of 89 children and adolescents with cah (48 female and 41 male subjects; age: 0.2-17.9 years) who presented in our outpatient department during 1 year. All individuals had classic cah, confirmed with molecular genetic analyses, and received substitution therapy (glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, if necessary). The quality of therapy was monitored in follow-up visits every 3 to 6 months, on the basis of clinical presentation and laboratory measurement findings according to current guidelines. We grouped the patients into salt wasting and simple virilizing groups, as well as according to current metabolic control. Leptin levels were measured with a commercial radioimmunoassay and calculated as sds. For statistical analyses, standard parametric and nonparametric methods were used., RESULTS: The chronologic ages of the children with CAH were between 0.20 and 17.9 years (mean +/- SD: 8.9 +/- 4.6 years). The BMI SDS of the whole group ranged from -2.7 to 4.3 (mean +/- SD: 0.88 +/- 1.3) and was significantly elevated above 0. Fifteen subjects (16.8%) had BMI SDS of >2.0, which indicated a significantly greater frequency of obesity among patients with CAH than expected for the normal population (expected: 2.27%). There was no significant difference in age and BMI between genders and clinical forms (salt wasting versus simple virilizing). BMI SDS was correlated positively with chronologic age. The BMI SDS did not differ significantly between children receiving hydrocortisone, prednisone, or dexamethasone. Hydrocortisone dosages (including equivalent dosages of prednisone and dexamethasone) ranged from 6.2 to 30.1 mg/m2 body surface area (mean +/- SD: 14.7 +/- 4.8 mg/m2 body surface area). Hydrocortisone dosages were correlated positively with BMI SDS. The relative risk of having a BMI SDS of >2.0 was not significantly elevated among children with prednisone/dexamethasone medication, compared with those with hydrocortisone treatment. In contrast to this, fludrocortisone dosage was not correlated with BMI SDS. Bone age delay, as calculated from the difference of bone age and chronologic age, ranged from -2.9 years to 5.6 years (mean +/- SD: 1.11 +/- 1.8 years) and was significantly elevated; it was correlated positively with BMI SDS. The BMI of parents ranged from 17.8 to 39.0 kg/m2 (median: 24.2 kg/m2). Median BMI values did not differ significantly between fathers and mothers. The relative risk for obesity among our children (BMI SDS of >2.0) was significantly elevated for children with obese parents, compared with those with nonobese parents (relative risk: 4.86). There was no significant correlation of birth length, birth weight, or gestational age with BMI SDS. Serum leptin values ranged from 0.10 to 32 microg/L (median: 4.4 microg/L); they were correlated positively with BMI SDS, chronologic age, and Tanner stage. After transformation into leptin concentration SDS values, the median SDS of 0.42 (range: -5.4 to 3.1) did not differ significantly from 0., CONCLUSIONS: Children and adolescents with CAH have a higher risk of obesity. Glucocorticoid dosage, chronologic age, advanced bone age maturation, and parental obesity contributed to elevated BMI SDS, whereas birth weight and length, serum leptin levels, used glucocorticoid, and fludrocortisone dosage were not associated with obesity. Therefore, children with CAH who become obese should be tightly monitored and should participate concurrently in weight management programs that include obese family members.

AB  - ObjectivesTo (i) determine whether perinatal factors (including maternal anthropometry and nutrition and early life growth measures) are associated with adiponectin and leptin levels in 9-year-old children, and (ii) assess relationships between adiponectin, leptin and concurrent lipid profile in these children. MethodsWe measured plasma adiponectin and leptin for 146 mothers-9-year-old child pairs from the ongoing longitudinal birth cohort followed by the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas. Data on perinatal factors, including sociodemographics, maternal anthropometry and nutrition, and early life child growth were collected during pregnancy, birth and 6-month visits. ResultsGreater rate of weight and length gain during the first 6 months of life were associated with lower adiponectin in 9-year-olds (=-2.0, P=0.04; =-8.2, P=0.02, respectively) adjusting for child body mass index (BMI). We found no associations between child adipokine levels and either maternal calorie, protein, total fat, saturated fat, fibre, sugar-sweetened beverage consumption during pregnancy or children's concurrent sugar-sweetened beverage and fast food intake. Lipid profile in 9-year-old children closely reflected adiponectin but not leptin levels after adjustment for child BMI. Additionally, we report that child adipokine levels were closely related to their mothers' levels at the 9-year visit. ConclusionOverall, our results support the hypothesis that early life factors may contribute to altered adipokine levels in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To address molecular mechanisms underlying obesity development, we examined patterns of critical metabolism-related hormones, adiponectin and leptin (adipokines), over childhood., SUBJECTS AND DESIGN: Plasma adiponectin and leptin were measured in 80 Mexican-American children at birth and again at 2, 5, and 9 years from the ongoing prospective cohort followed by the Center for the Health Assessment of Mothers and Children of Salinas (CHAMACOS). We used a mixture modeling approach to identify patterns in adipokine trajectories from birth to 9 years., RESULTS: Leptin was positively related to child body size within all ages, however adiponectin had inverse and weaker associations with BMI at 2, 5, and 9 years. Correlations between adipokine levels over the 0-2, 2-5, and 5-9-year periods increased for both leptin (r = 0.06, 0.31 and 0.62) and adiponectin (r = 0.25, 0.41 and 0.46). Our mixture modeling approach identified three trajectory clusters for both leptin (1L [slowly-rising], 2L [rapidly-rising], and 3L [stable]) and adiponectin (1A [steep-dropping and rebounding], 2A [moderately-dropping], and 3A [stable]). While leptin groups were most separated over the 2-9-year period, adiponectin trajectories displayed greatest heterogeneity from birth to 2 years. Children in the rapidly-rising 2L group had highest BMI and waist circumference at 9 years. Further, children with greater birth weight had increased odds of belonging to this high risk group (OR = 1.21 95% CI 1.03, 1.43, compared to stable group 3L). Children whose mothers consumed more sugar-sweetened beverages during pregnancy were at risk of being in the steep-dropping 1A group (OR = 1.08, 95% CI 1.01, 1.17, compared to stable group 3A)., CONCLUSION: Our results highlight developmental differences in leptin and adiponectin over the childhood period. Leptin closely reflects child body size however factors affecting adiponectin and long-term consequences of its changes over infancy need to be further explored.

AB  - Background Altered irisin levels have been reported in pregnancy-associated disorders, such as preeclampsia. Objective A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to evaluate the changes in maternal circulatory irisin levels in preeclampsia as compared to normotensive healthy pregnant controls. Methods Relevant studies were identified by searching PubMed and other databases. Random-effects model was used to obtain standardized mean differences (SMDs) and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The sub-group meta-regression analyses were conducted to explore heterogeneity. The presence of publication bias and the study robustness was tested using funnel plot and sensitivity analyses, respectively. Results This meta-analysis finally included 14 observations from eight studies. Compared with controls, preeclampsia patients showed significantly decreased serum irisin levels (SMD: -1.13; 95% CI: -1.63 to -0.62, p < .0001). The sub-group analysis showed that this decrease in irisin is regardless of body mass index (BMI) and gestational age of preeclampsia patients. The meta-regression analysis indicated that blood pressure is significantly associated with the observed results. There was no significant publication bias as indicated by the funnel plot analysis followed by Begg's (p = .35) and Egger's tests (p = .39). The sensitivity analysis indicated that no single study had a significant influence on the overall outcome, suggesting the robustness of this meta-analysis. Conclusions This meta-analysis showed significantly decreased maternal serum irisin level in preeclampsia patients as compared to normotensive pregnant women. This study highlights the need for future studies evaluating the diagnostic utilities and associations of irisin with the fetal and neonatal outcomes in preeclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of resistin in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance during pregnancy and on the birth weight of infants born from women with gestational diabetes (GDM)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty women diagnosed with GDM were compared to 30 normal pregnant controls. Maternal serum resistin and insulin levels were measured at the time of the oral glucose tolerance test screening. In addition, umbilical levels of resistin and insulin were measured at the time of delivery., RESULTS: There was no difference in maternal serum resistin levels in women with GDM as compared to normal controls at 24-26 weeks. There was no difference in umbilical resistin levels between the infants born in the two groups. There was no correlation between infant weight and either maternal resistin at 24-26 week or umbilical resistin levels., CONCLUSION: There were no significant differences in umbilical resistin levels between infants born of women with GDM as compared to normal pregnant women. In addition, there was no correlation between resistin levels during pregnancy, as well as between umbilical resistin levels and neonatal birth weight. In conclusion, resistin seems to play a rather minor role in the pathophysiology of GDM and the energy metabolism during fetal life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate maternal serum adiponectin and Interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels during the pre- and post-partum periods in pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., DESIGN: Thirty control pregnant Caucasian women without GDM and thirty body mass index (BMI) and age-matched Caucasian women with GDM examined in the outpatient clinic between the 24th and 26th week of their pregnancy and on the 3rd day postpartum underwent anthropometry and had serum blood taken. Both groups, were monitored by a dietitian and had comparable weight gain during pregnancy. Birth weight was also measured., RESULTS: At the 3rd day postpartum, compared to the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, women with GDM had lower serum adiponectin levels, lower serum IL-1beta levels and lower homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values. At the 2nd trimester of pregnancy, women with GDM had lower serum adiponectin levels, higher IL-1beta and higher HOMA-IR values compared to women without GDM. At the 3rd day postpartum, women with GDM had lower serum adiponectin levels, higher IL-1beta and higher HOMA-IR values compared to women without GDM. Second trimester serum adiponectin values of women with GDM correlated negatively with birth weight., CONCLUSIONS: Gestational diabetes is a state of insulin resistance associated with altered levels of proinflammatory cytokines, increased IL-1beta and decreased adiponectin values. Both of these alterations might be attributed to placental pathology in pregnancies with GDM.

AB  - To investigate the fetoplacental leptin circulation in gestational diabetes, we compared cord leptin and insulin levels in 17 healthy pregnant women and 17 women with gestational-onset diabetes. Leptin levels in the umbilical arteries (mean+/-SD 1.80+/-0.76 ng/ml) were significantly (P<0.006) lower than those in umbilical veins (2.67+/-0.98 ng/ml) in normal pregnancies. Similarly, leptin levels in umbilical veins (mean+/-4.59+/-1.60 ng/ml) were significantly (P<0.001) higher than those in umbilical arteries (mean+/-SD 2.08+/-0.90 ng/ml) in gestational diabetes. However, leptin levels in umbilical veins were significantly higher (P<0.002) in gestational diabetes than those in controls. Additionally, in women with diabetes but not in controls, the birth weight and the cord leptin concentrations were positively related to cord insulin levels. We conclude that there is a hyperleptinaemia in the fetoplacental circulation in pregnant women with carbohydrate intolerance and in these cases insulin and leptin may have antagonist roles regarding fetal development.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alter the maternal and fetal leptin levels., METHODS: Fifty primigravidas between 28 and 34 weeks of gestation were divided into three groups: group A consisted of 17 normal pregnant women with a mean gestational age of 31 weeks, group B consisted of 15 women with gestational hypertension without proteinuria with a mean gestational age of 30 weeks and group C consisted of 18 pre-eclamptic women with a mean gestational age of 31 weeks., RESULTS: The pre-eclamptics had significantly higher serum leptin levels than those in normal pregnancies (p<0.001) but no difference was noted between normal and gestational hypertensive pregnancies. Pre-eclamptic women had significantly higher umbilical vein leptin levels (4.68+/-1.66ng/ml) compared to normal pregnancies (1.92+/-0.71ng/ml) and those with gestational hypertension (2.47+/-0.81ng/ml)., CONCLUSIONS: Pre-eclampsia is associated with an increase in maternal plasma leptin levels and fetal of leptin production increases in gestational hypertension and even more in pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Background: While the adverse metabolic effects of exposure to obesogenic diets during both the prenatal and early postnatal period are well established, the relative impact of exposure during these separate developmental windows remains unclear. This study aimed to assess the relative contribution of exposure to a maternal cafeteria diet during pregnancy and lactation on body weight, fat mass and expression of lipogenic and adipokine genes in the offspring. Methods: Wistar rats were fed either a control chow (Control, n = 14) or obesogenic cafeteria diet (CAF, n = 12) during pregnancy and lactation. Pups were cross-fostered to another dam in either the same or different dietary group within 24 h of birth. Body weight, body fat mass and expression of lipogenic and adipokine genes in subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissues were determined in offspring at weaning and 3 weeks post-weaning. Results: Offspring suckled by CAF dams had a lower body weight (P < 0.05), but similar to 2-fold higher percentage body fat at weaning than offspring suckled by Control dams (P < 0.01), independent of whether they were born to a Control or CAF dam. At 6 weeks of age, after all offspring were weaned onto standard chow, males and females suckled by CAF dams remained lighter (P < 0.05) than offspring suckled by Control dams, but the percentage fat mass was no longer different between groups. Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c) mRNA expression was similar to 25% lower in offspring suckled by cafeteria dams in males at weaning (P < 0.05) and in females at 6 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Exposure to a cafeteria diet during the suckling period alone also resulted in increased adipocyte Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma) mRNA expression in females, and adiponectin and leptin mRNA expression in both sexes at weaning. Conclusions: The findings from this study point to the critical role of the suckling period for deposition of adipose tissue in rodents, and the potential role of altered adipocyte gene expression in mediating these effects.

AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the relationships between the adipocytokine levels, markers of inflammation, and vascular remodelling in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective study. One hundred and forty pregnant patients were enrolled. Adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in IUGR, small for gestational age (SGA), and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) mother-child couples at delivery. IUGR and SGA fetuses were defined as fetuses whose estimated fetal weight (EFW) was below 10th percentile for gestational age with and without umbilical artery (UA) Doppler abnormalities, respectively. Fetal aorta intima media thickness (aIMT) was evaluated by ultrasound in the same fetal groups. Data were analyzed by R (version 2.15.2)., RESULTS: There were 37 IUGR mother-child couples, 33 SGA, and 70 AGA. Leptin, TNFalpha, IL-6, and CRP serum levels were higher in IUGR pregnant patients (P < 0.05). Adiponectin levels were significantly reduced in IUGR fetuses compared to SGA and AGA, while leptin, TNFalpha, and IL-6 levels were higher in IUGR group (P <= 0.05). Fetal aIMT was significantly higher in IUGR (P < 0.05) and in this group there was a negative correlation between aIMT and adiponectin/leptin ratio (A/L ratio) (P < 0.05) and between adiponectin and IL-6 levels (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, compared to SGA and AGA, IUGR fetuses had reduced circulating levels of adiponectin and elevated measures of aIMT and several inflammatory markers. Moreover, adiponectin levels were negatively correlated with aIMT in IUGR fetuses suggesting a possible causal link between reduced adiponectin and vessel remodelling.

AB  - We investigated the relationship between early antibiotic exposure before 6 months age and risk for obesity at 2 years in a high-risk, low-income, urban Latino cohort (n = 97), with the hypothesis that antibiotic exposure would increase risk for obesity by 2 years. Data were collected through maternal report of infant 24-hour dietary intake at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, 1, and 2 years; and food frequency questionnaires at 4-6 weeks, 6 months, 1, and 2 years. Antibiotic use data, including type and frequency, were collected through maternal self-report at 6 months and 1 year. Cord blood levels of leptin and insulin were measured at birth. Chi-squared tests were used to assess the relationship between obesity and dichotomous predictors and Student's t-tests for continuous predictors. Multivariable logistic models were used to ascertain independent predictors of obesity at age 2. We found that early antibiotic exposure before 6 months was independently associated with increased risk for rapid infant weight gain [odds ratio (OR) 6.42, 95% confidence interval (CI, defined as the range in which sample will fall with 95% confidence: 1.17-35.06)] and obesity at age 2 [OR 6.15, 95% CI (1.03-36.70)]. These findings provide evidence promoting antibiotic stewardship in pediatric practices to minimize exposure in the first 6 months of life.

AB  - The prospective study assessed the influence of serum leptin levels on markers of bone metabolism and bone mineral density in 2-year-old infants born preterm. A total of 57 randomized preterm Caucasian newborns (32nd-37th week of gestation) were included in the study. Bone metabolism markers were measured every 6 months. The infants were monitored prospectively up to the age of 2 years. When the infants turned 2 years of age, they were investigated by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (lumbar spine). The median cord blood leptin levels was 3.07 mug/L. The median leptin level during check-ups before 2 years of age was 9.96 mug/L. The other laboratory markers were within the normal ranges for that age. The bone mineral density reached, on average, 0.410 g/cm2. Lower leptin levels in the cord blood and in the serum of preterm infants do not influence bone mineral density during the first 2 years of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal age at childbirth is increasing worldwide, but studies investigating the consequences of this trend on offspring metabolic health are scarce. We investigated the associations of maternal age at childbirth with metabolic outcomes in adult male siblings., METHODS: We used data from 586 men aged 25-45 participating in a cross-sectional, population-based sibling-pair study, including maternal age at childbirth and offspring birthweight, adult weight, height, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-derived body composition, blood pressure, and total cholesterol, glucose and insulin levels from fasting serum samples. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)., RESULTS: Maternal age at childbirth was 27.1 +/- 4.7 years and was inversely associated with glucose levels (beta = -0.10, P = 0.022) and HOMA-IR (beta = -0.06, P = 0.065) in age- and body composition-adjusted analyses. Moreover, sons of younger (aged <25 and 25-29) and older (aged >=35) mothers had higher HOMA-IR values than sons of mothers aged 30-34 (1.39, 1.35 and 1.42 vs 1.19, P = 0.028). Additional adjustment for birthweight did not substantially alter these results. Maternal age was inversely associated with cholesterol levels in unadjusted (beta = -0.09, P = 0.032), but not in age- and body composition-adjusted analyses. No associations of maternal age were observed with blood pressure, leptin, or adiponectin levels or with any of the body composition measurements., CONCLUSIONS: Increasing maternal age at childbirth is associated with lower fasting glucose levels and higher insulin sensitivity in adult male offspring. However, this association might not hold true in offspring of women aged >=35 years at childbirth. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity is associated with several adverse pregnancy outcomes. This study was conducted aiming to evaluate maternal levels of adipokines and insulin in pregnancies complicated by overweight and obesity and its correlations with maternal and fetal outcomes., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 72 mother-newborn pairs. Mothers were classified as having normal weight (n = 23), overweight (n = 18), and obesity (n = 31). Maternal adiponectin, leptin, resistin and insulin levels at the end of pregnancy were compared among groups and correlated with maternal and perinatal outcomes. Data were analyzed by ANOVA and correlation tests, with a p value <0.05 being considered as significant., RESULTS: Obese pregnant women showed higher leptin levels (p = 0.0021). Leptin levels were positively correlated with prepregnancy body mass index-BMI (r = 0.57), gestational (37 or 38 weeks of gestation) BMI (r = 0.39), hypertension (r = 0.27), and hyperglycemia (r = 0.30), and negatively associated with newborns' abdominal circumference (r = -0.25). Adiponectin concentrations were negatively correlated with gestational BMI (r = -0.29) and newborns' cephalic circumference (r = -0.27) and positively correlated with birth weight (r = 0.23). Insulin concentrations correlated positively with prepregnancy BMI (r = 0.38), gestational BMI (r = 0.24) and maternal hyperglycemia (r = 0.26)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the relationship between markers of obesity and maternal-fetal outcomes. Maternal insulin and adipokines levels showed an independent relationship with mother and newborns outcomes, respectively. In this studied population, the results indirectly reinforce the importance of maternal weight control before and during pregnancy to avoid adverse outcomes to mother and their newborns.

AB  - Overweight gravidas and gravidas with a robust weight gain have an accrued risk of delivering a large-for-gestational age (LGA) baby. Here, we examined whether the measurement of insulin and adipokines--peptides secreted mainly by adipose tissue--at the glucose challenge test (GCT) improves the prediction of birth weight. We studied 631 singleton pregnancies at 24 to 29 weeks' gestational age (GA) with data on height, baseline body weight (BW), and BW change between baseline and the GCT. In addition to glucose and insulin, we measured adiponectin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor (the main leptin-binding protein), and tumor necrosis factor alpha. We found that birth weight was related to maternal height, baseline BW, and BW change, and also--albeit less strongly--to insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and soluble leptin receptor concentrations. In multiple regression analyses, body size parameters explained approximately 10% of the variance in birth weight, of which BW change was the most important correlate, but the metabolic markers added only approximately 2% variance, with leptin alone adding 1.4%. Gravidas carrying a small-for-GA (SGA) fetus were more likely to have a leptin value in the highest quartile than those with an appropriate-for-GA fetus (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.3; P = .04), but there were no other differences in the metabolic markers between SGA or LGA and appropriate-for-GA pregnancies. In conclusion, measuring insulin and adipokines at the GCT has limited, if any, clinical benefit to predict which fetuses will be SGA or LGA at birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that gravidas who have ail abnormal response to glucose loading have dysfunctional adipose tissue cells that produce more insulin resistance-inducing and proinflammatory adipokines but less insulin-sensitizing adipokines. METHODS: We performed a nested case-control study within a larger sample of gravidas who had a glucose challenge test (GCT) at 24-29 weeks; we compared 73 cases with all abnormal GCT (> 8.3 mM) and 146 controls with a strictly normal GCT (< 7.2 mM) matched for body mass index (BMI) and height (mean, difference between cases and controls: 0.1 kg/m(2) and 1 cm, respectively). We measured plasma insulin, adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha, interleukin [IL]-6), soluble leptin receptor (sOb-R), the main leptin-binding protein, and C-reactive protein (CRP). RESULTS: The cases showed a 48% increase in insulin concentrations and a 27% increase in TNF-alpha concentrations compared to the controls (both P <.0001), but leptin, sOb-R, IL-6, and adiponectin, as well as CRP, concentrations were comparable between cases and controls. In, the whole group (n = 219), BMI was correlated with insulin, leptin, IL-6, and CRP, and inversely with sOb-R and adiponectin concentrations (all P <.0003). CONCLUSIONS: Plasma leptin, sOb-R, IL-6, and adiponectin, as well as CRP, are strongly related to BMI in gravidas at 24-29 weeks gestational age but not to the glucose loading response. However, TNF-alpha, is higher in women with all abnormal GCT. Further studies should disclose the source of increased TNF-alpha. in these women, and to assess whether TNF-alpha is causally related to glucose intolerance during pregnancy.

Factors that could mediate intra-uterine "programing" of glucose homeostasis include endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids, adipose tissue-secreted factors such as adiponectin, and in utero hypoxia. Here, we studied 123 fetuses with gestational age (GA) between 25 and 37 wk and birth weight sd score (BW SDS) between -2.79 and 2.42. We measured proinsulin, C-peptide, insulin, and adiponectin in umbilical vein (UV) plasma and calculated the proinsulin to insulin ratio as a measure of beta-cell secretory function. These indices were related to GA, BW SDS, time since the last maternal betamethasone administration, and blood gas data. Insulin and C-peptide were correlated with BW SDS but not GA, whereas the proinsulin to insulin ratio was inversely correlated with BW SDS. The proinsulin to insulin ratio was raised (P = 0.002) in fetuses with UV PO(2) less than or equal to 21.3 mm Hg (i.e. the 50th percentile) compared with those with PO(2) more than 21.3 mm Hg, inferring that in utero hypoxia engenders beta-cell secretory dysfunction. Proinsulin, insulin, and C-peptide were markedly but transiently (<24 h) elevated after maternal betamethasone administration, returning thereafter to concentrations measured in noncorticosteroid-treated fetuses. However, there was considerable variability within the less than 24-h betamethasone group: the indices of insulin secretion were related to UV PO(2), suggesting that hypoxia attenuates the responsiveness of fetal beta-cells to corticosteroids. Adiponectin was not related to any of the insulin indices. In conclusion, we have identified two environmental signals that modulate fetal insulin output: maternal corticosteroids produce a transient surge in fetal insulin synthesis and secretion, whereas in utero hypoxia disturbs the insulin secretory process.

AB  - The prediction of birth weight may be improved by the measurement of hormones or growth factors in the mother. We measured body weight (BW) and plasma levels of placental GH (PGH), IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and leptin at the time of the glucose challenge test (GCT) in 289 women, who were pregnant with a single fetus, between 24 and 29 wk gestational age (GA). Delivery occurred 12 +/- 2 (mean +/- SD) wk later. First, we examined which variables regulate these hormonal factors. Multiple regression showed that PGH concentrations were determined by GA at sampling and were negatively related to BW. IGF-I levels were mainly determined by PGH, and also by insulin, BW, and (negatively) age. IGFBP-1 concentrations were negatively determined by BW, insulin, and IGF-I. BW was also a powerful determinant of leptin levels, with insulin as a less robust determinant. Second, we examined the relation to glucose levels. PGH, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 concentrations were not correlated with post-GCT glucose levels and were comparable in women with a normal or disturbed GCT (glucose >/=7.8 mmol/liter; n = 72). Finally, we examined the relation with birth weight and placental weight. Birth weight, corrected for GA and stratified into percentile groups, and the ponderal index at birth were strongly related to maternal BW, but not to maternal PGH, IGF-I, or IGFBP-1 levels. Neither was maternal leptin related to birth weight, but leptin concentrations were slightly higher in women who delivered obese babies. Placental weight was not related to any of the hormonal factors. This prospective study indicates that the variation in circulating PGH, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, and leptin between 24 and 29 wk of pregnancy is strongly dependent on maternal BW, but is unrelated to glucose tolerance. In addition, the measurement of PGH, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, or leptin at the time of the GCT is not useful clinically to predict birth weight.

AB  - A significant association between hypertension and obesity has been noted in several epidemiological studies. In particular, a progressive increase has been demonstrated, both in men and women, in the prevalence of hypertension in relation to the different measures of obesity. Such association is independent of age, gender, and also probably the ethnic group. It has also been shown that obesity may antedate and predict the development of hypertension. Even among subjects with normal or optimal blood pressure, the obese subjects are more likely to develop high blood pressure levels in the following years. The opposite can also be true. Hypertensive subjects are more likely to develop obesity than normotensive ones. It has been suggested that initial sympathetic hyperactivity may lead to high blood pressure and progressive hyperstimulation, followed by down-regulation, of beta-adrenergic receptors, with subsequent development of obesity because of the lesser beta-adrenoceptor that induces dissipation of calories. Visceral obesity seems to be more important than subcutaneous obesity with respect to high blood pressure. Finally, in addition to the well established relation between low weight at birth and adult hypertension, it has also been shown that any transient increases in body weight may be paralleled by increases in blood pressure at any time in life. Obesity may be associated with hypertension through an increased sympathetic tone, increased fluid retention and insulin resistance. Animal models of hypertension associated with obesity may be suitable to investigate in detail the pathophysiological mechanisms of such association. In this setting decreased nitric oxide production and resistance to leptin have been identified as important determinants of obesity in hypertension. From a therapeutic standpoint, it is well known that weight reduction is associated with a drop in blood pressure. Unfortunately, however, obese hypertensive subjects who loose weight in the short term often do not succeed to maintain the weight loss, with consequent new gain in body weight and blood pressure. Thus, weight reduction should be maintained in the long term to elicit a sustained and effective antihypertensive efficacy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From the conception onward, certain parameters associated with maternal health may affect foetal body composition, growth and bone mineral content. The objective of the study was to determine the association between maternal vitamin D and adiponectin status with the anthropometrical measures of newborns, and bone health status measured by Quantitative Ultrasound (QUS) at birth., METHODS: Circulating 25OHD and adiponectin concentration were measured in 73 pregnant women. Correlations with the anthropometrical measures and bone health status in their infants were studied. Bone health was evaluated using QUS with the measurements of speed of sound (SOS, in m/s) and Z score on the right tibia., RESULTS: There was no significant association between maternal 25OHD and newborn's anthropometrical measures at birth (weight p=0.35, length p=0.59 and head circumference p=0.47). There was a significant negative correlation between a maternal serum adiponectin and a) weight of infants at birth (R= -0.37, p=0.002); b) birth length (R= -0.31, p=0.008) and c) head circumference (R= -0.29, p=0.014). There was no significant correlation between maternal 25OHD blood levels during pregnancy and SOS in newborns (p=0.48). Additionally, a correlation between maternal adiponectin concentration during pregnancy and SOS in newborns was not significant (p=0.82)., CONCLUSION: Although a high prevalence of low 25OHD level among pregnant women was found, maternal vitamin D status did not influence growth and bone health of their offspring at birth. Maternal adiponectin levels in plasma showed an inverse relationship with anthropometrical measures of infants at birth, while no correlation with the newborn's bone health was found.

AB  - In the present pilot study, we evaluated the effect of maternal adiposity on the plasma concentration of adipocytokines in pregnant women and their newborns. Twenty patients with term gestations without labour were initially selected by pregestational BMI and then classified into two study groups (n 10 each), according to their median value of adiposity (total body fat). Concentrations of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, IL-6, leptin and adiponectin in plasma of maternal peripheral blood and fetal cord blood were measured and correlated to maternal adiposity. Maternal adiposity showed a significant negative correlation with fetal adiponectin (r - 0.587, P = 0.01) and IL-6 (r - 0.466, P = 0.05), a significant positive correlation with maternal leptin (r 0.527, P = 0.02) and no correlation with TNF-alpha or IL-1beta. Adiponectin was higher in fetal plasma than in maternal plasma (P = 0.043), but significantly lower in newborns from women with high adiposity than in newborns from women with low adiposity (P = 0.040). Our results suggest that fetuses from obese women may be less able to control inflammation, due to lower circulating anti-inflammatory adipocytokines, which could limit their optimal development or even increase the risk of abortion or preterm labour.

AB  - Apelin is an insulin-sensitizing hormone increased in abundance with obesity. Apelin and its receptor, APJ, are expressed in the human placenta, but whether apelin regulates placental function in normal body mass index (BMI) and obese pregnant women remains unknown. We hypothesized that apelin stimulates amino acid transport in cultured primary human trophoblast (PHT) cells and that maternal circulating apelin levels are elevated in obese pregnant women delivering large babies. Treating PHT cells with physiological concentrations of the pyroglutamated form [Pyr1]apelin-13 (0.1-10.0 ng/ml) for 24 h dose-dependently increased System A amino acid transport (P < 0.05) but did not affect System L transport activity. Mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK1/2), and AMP-activated protein kinase-alpha (AMPKalpha) signaling were unaffected by apelin (P > 0.05). Plasma apelin was not different in obese women (BMI 35.8 +/- 0.7, n = 21) with large babies compared with normal-BMI women (23.1 +/- 0.5, n = 16) delivering normal birth weight infants. Apelin was highly expressed in placental villous tissue (20-fold higher vs. adipose), and APJ was present in syncytiotrophoblast microvillous membrane, but neither differed in abundance between normal-BMI and obese women. Phosphorylation (Thr172) of placental AMPKalpha strongly correlated with microvillous membrane APJ expression (P < 0.01, R = 0.63) but negatively correlated with placental apelin abundance (P < 0.01, R = -0.62). Neither placental APJ nor apelin abundance correlated with maternal BMI, plasma insulin, birth weight, or mTOR or ERK1/2 signaling (P > 0.05). Hence, apelin stimulates trophoblast amino acid uptake, establishing a novel mechanism regulating placental function. We found no evidence that apelin constitutes an endocrine link between maternal obesity and fetal overgrowth.

AB  - The fetus requires amino acids for the processes of protein synthesis, carbon accretion, oxidative metabolism, and biosynthesis, which ultimately determine growth rate in utero. The fetal supply of amino acids is critically dependent on the transport capacity of the placenta. System A amino acid transporters in the syncytiotrophoblast microvillous plasma membrane, directed toward maternal blood, actively accumulate amino acids, while system L exchangers mediate uptake of essential amino acids from the maternal circulation. The functional capacity and protein abundance of these transporters in the placenta are related to fetal growth in both humans and experimental animals. Maternal nutritional and endocrine signals including insulin, insulin-like growth factors, adipokines, and steroid hormones regulate placental amino acid transport, against the background of growth signals originating from the fetus. Anabolic signals of abundant maternal resource availability stimulate placental amino acid transport to optimize offspring fitness, whereas catabolic signals reduce placental amino acid transport in an attempt to ensure survival and long-term reproductive capacity of the mother when resources are scarce. These signals regulate placental amino acid transport by controlling transcription, translation, plasma membrane trafficking, and degradation of transporters. Adaptations in placental amino acid transport capacity may underlie either under- or overgrowth of the fetus when maternal nutrient and hormone levels are altered as a result of altered maternal nutrition or metabolic disease. Strategies to modulate placental amino acid transport may prove effective to normalize fetal growth in intrauterine growth restriction and fetal overgrowth. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the independent contributions to infant birth size of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and leptin measured in umbilical cord plasma., METHODS: Umbilical cord blood was collected in 12 804 consecutive deliveries, and cord plasma from 585 singleton infants born at term after uncomplicated pregnancies was analyzed for leptin, IGF-I, and 2 IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3). In multivariable analyses, we assessed maternal and infant covariates of leptin and IGF-I, and we evaluated the independent contribution of cord levels of leptin and IGF-I on infant birth size., RESULTS: Cord plasma levels of IGF-I were lower in women who reported smoking at the beginning of pregnancy compared with nonsmokers. In female infants, levels of IGF-I and leptin were higher than in male infants after adjustment for ponderal index and maternal factors. We found a strong parallel increase in umbilical IGF-I and leptin with increasing birth weight and birth length. For IGFBP-1, there was an opposite pattern: IGFBP-1 increased with decreasing birth size. The multivariable analysis, adjusted for length of gestation and maternal age, parity, prepregnancy weight, smoking during pregnancy, and offspring sex, showed that IGF-I and leptin, independent of each other, were associated with birth weight and birth length., CONCLUSIONS: Levels of IGF-I and leptin in umbilical cord plasma were higher in girls than in boys, but in both sexes, these 2 factors contributed independently and positively to birth weight and length. For IGFBP-1, high levels were associated with low birth weight and reduced length. If intrauterine growth is related to the risk of developing adult diseases, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, and leptin may be involved in the underlying processes.1131-1135 insulin like growth factors, leptin, umbilical cord plasma, birth weight.

AB  - Diabetes during pregnancy is associated with elevated maternal insulin, leptin and IL-6. Within the placenta, IL-6 can further stimulate leptin production. Despite structural similarities and shared roles in inflammation, leptin and IL-6 have contrasting effects on neurodevelopment, and the relative importance of maternal diabetes or chorioamnionitis on fetal hormone exposure has not been defined. We hypothesized that there would be a positive correlation between IL-6 and leptin with progressively increased levels in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes and chorioamnionitis. To test this hypothesis, cord blood samples were obtained from 104 term infants, including 47 exposed to maternal diabetes. Leptin, insulin, and IL-6 were quantified by multiplex assay. Factors independently associated with hormone levels were identified by univariate and multivariate linear regression. Unlike IL-6, leptin and insulin were significantly increased by maternal diabetes. Maternal BMI and birth weight were independent predictors of leptin and insulin with birth weight the strongest predictor of leptin. Clinically diagnosed chorioamnionitis and neonatal sepsis were associated with increased IL-6 but not leptin. Among appropriate for gestational age infants without sepsis, IL-6 and leptin were strongly correlated (R=0.6, P<0.001). In summary, maternal diabetes and birth weight are associated with leptin while chorioamnionitis is associated with IL-6. The constraint of the positive association between leptin and IL-6 to infants without sepsis suggests that the term infant and placenta may have a limited capacity to increase cord blood levels of the neuroprotective hormone leptin in the presence of increased cord blood levels of the potential neurotoxin IL-6.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and obesity in adulthood. Several studies on diverse geographic and ethnic cohorts have provided evidence that being born small for gestational age (SGA) increases adult disease risk through various pathways of metabolic dysregulation. Unfavorable influences in the fetal environment may program metabolic homeostasis in later life affecting blood pressure, glucose tolerance and lipid regulation. Fetal restricted protein supply may impair the development of the kidney and reduce the nephron number, which is involved in blood pressure regulation. Moreover, children exposed to IUGR may exhibit postnatal rapid catch-up growth, altered body composition, increased visceral adiposity and low adiponectin levels which predispose to cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus in adulthood. Impairment in fetal pancreatic development and subsequent insulin signalling deficits due to IUGR may also be involved in the pathogenesis of these conditions. This review summarizes some of the hypotheses that have been put forward to explain the association between fetal growth restriction and subsequent metabolic dysregulation that may increase adult disease risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin, a hormone that signals the amount of energy stores to the brain, has recently been shown to play a role in the regulation of several hypothalamic pituitary axes, including the growth hormone axis. To investigate a potential association between cord blood leptin concentrations and intrauterine growth we measured leptin concentrations in the cord blood of small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) healthy newborns., PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Cord blood leptin concentrations were evaluated in 25 SGA, 100 AGA, and 45 LGA, neonates., RESULTS: Leptin was detectable in all newborns in concentrations comparable with those found in adults. Moreover, SGA newborns had lower leptin concentrations (3.70 +/- 1.81 micrograms/l) than AGA (5.65 +/- 4.98 micrograms/l) and LGA newborns (11.99 +/- 7.06 micrograms/ l)(P < 0.01). Cord blood leptin concentrations were significantly associated with ponderal index, cord blood insulin concentrations, placental weight and maternal serum leptin concentrations. Importantly, the association between cord blood leptin concentrations and intrauterine growth status persisted after adjusting for adiposity, placental weight, maternal serum leptin concentrations and cord blood insulin concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood leptin concentrations are independently associated with intrauterine growth. Future studies are needed to elucidate the underlying mechanism and clarify the role of leptin in regulating growth and controlling appetite in newborns.

AB  - Background Gestational weight gain (GWG) influences both fetal and maternal health. Leptin is a biomarker that may predict the early development of obesity and greater weight gain in childhood. Newborns with higher neonatal weight have been found to have higher leptin levels in umbilical cord blood (UCB). There are few studies that evaluate leptin levels in UCB according to GWG in women with a normal body mass index (BMI). The aim of the present study was to determine whether the levels of leptin in UCB in neonates born to mothers with a high GWG were higher, compared with levels in newborns whose mothers had a low GWG. Methods A cross-sectional analytic study was conducted on 65 primigravidas. They were under 30 years of age, had normal pregestational BMIs, no associated diseases and were classified as having high (n = 22) or low (n = 43) GWG. The neonatal UCB leptin levels were measured and both neonatal and maternal anthropometric evaluations were carried out. The quantitative variables were compared through the Mann-Whitney U test and Student's t test, as appropriate. Results UCB leptin levels were higher in the neonates whose mothers were in the high GWG group, compared with those born to mothers in the low GWG group (7.0 [1.9-11.4] vs. 2.9 [1.2-6.7] ng/mL, p = 0.020). When stratified by sex, that difference was maintained only in male neonates. Conclusions UCB leptin levels were higher in neonates born to mothers with a high GWG, compared with those in newborns whose mothers had a low GWG.

AB  - CONTEXT: Obesity and diabetes during pregnancy are associated with increased insulin resistance and higher neonatal adiposity. In turn, insulin resistance triggers inflammatory pathways with accumulation of placental cytokines., OBJECTIVE: To determine placental signals that translate into development of excess adipose tissue, we investigated the role of phospholipases A2 (PLA2) as targets of inflammatory mediators., SETTING: The study was conducted at Case Western Reserve University, Department of Reproductive Biology., SUBJECTS: Volunteers gave informed written consent in accordance with the Institutional Review Board guidelines. Placenta and cord blood samples were obtained at the time of elective cesarean section in 15 term pregnancies., INTERVENTION: Neonatal anthropometric measurements were performed within 48 h of delivery. Placentas were grouped based on neonatal percentage body fat as obese (body fat > or = 16%) and lean control (body fat < or = 8%)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcomes were placenta PLA2 expression and fatty acid concentration., RESULTS: Expression of PLA2G2A and PLA2G5, the main placenta phospholipases, was greater (P < 0.05) in placenta of obese compared with control neonates and was associated with increased 20:3 and 20:5 omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids. TNF-alpha and leptin content was increased 3-fold in placenta of obese neonates. TNF-alpha and leptin both induced a time-dependent activation of PLA2G2 and PLA2G5 in placental cells., CONCLUSION: Accumulation of omega-3 fatty acids through secretory PLA2 activation is associated with high neonatal adiposity. We propose that the generation of placental lipid mediators through TNF-alpha and leptin stimulation represents a key mechanism to favor excess fetal fat accretion.

AB  - CONTEXT: Sex steroid concentrations have a strong genetic determination, but environmental factors and body composition play an important role. From studies in children with intrauterine growth restriction, low birth weight has been associated with altered gonadotropin concentrations., OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate sex steroid concentrations in healthy young brothers in relation to birth weight (normal gestational age), body composition, and parental steroid concentrations., DESIGN AND SETTING: We conducted a cross-sectional, population-based sibling pair study with inclusion of parental data., PARTICIPANTS: A total of 677 men (25-45 yr old) were included in this study, with 296 independent pairs of brothers and 122 fathers., MAIN OUTCOMES: We measured testosterone, estradiol, leptin, adiponectin, IGF-I (immunoassays), and free steroid hormones (calculated) in relation to birth weight and changes in body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry)., RESULTS: Birth weight was associated with serum testosterone (P = 0.0004) and SHBG (P = 0.0001), independent from weight, age, or fat mass, whereas no association with (free) estradiol, LH, or FSH was found. Paternal testosterone (P = 0.02), estradiol (P = 0.04), and SHBG (P = 0.0004) were associated with the respective sex steroid concentrations in the brothers. Weight increase (population rank) during life, was associated with lower testosterone (-15%; P < 0.001), independent from current weight and with higher free estradiol concentrations (+8%; P = 0.002), whereas weight decrease was associated with higher testosterone (+13%; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Birth weight and paternal steroid concentrations are associated with testosterone concentrations, independent from adult weight. These findings support the concept of in utero programming across the range of birth weight.

AB  - Observational studies suggest that breast-feeding is associated with a more favourable BMI and cardio-metabolic markers, but potential underlying mechanisms are unclear. As serum adiponectin has an important function in adults for glucose and lipid metabolism, we assessed 251 participants of the Prevention and Incidence of Asthma and Mite Allergy birth cohort whether breast milk adiponectin is associated with childhood BMI and cardio-metabolic markers. We measured adiponectin levels in breast milk collected around 3 months after birth of the child and subsequently obtained weight and height repeatedly up to the age of 17 years. A medical examination (including blood pressure, glycated Hb and cholesterol) was performed at the age of 8, 12 and 16 years. We used multivariable mixed models to assess the association between breast milk adiponectin and BMI and cardio-metabolic markers at these ages. In models adjusted for exact age of breast milk collection, maternal age, presence of siblings, maternal BMI, pregnancy weight gain and child's birth weight, each unit increase in log breast milk adiponectin (in ng/ml) was associated with a 0.28 lower BMI z score (95 % CI -0.56, 0.00) at 3 months. After the age of 1 year, there was a tendency towards a higher BMI z score with increased breast milk adiponectin at some ages, but this pattern was not consistent throughout childhood. There were no associations between breast milk adiponectin and any of the cardio-metabolic markers in childhood. We conclude that in our study with follow-up until 17 years of age, breast milk adiponectin has no long-term effect on BMI and cardio-metabolic health during childhood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Interactions between polymorphisms of the melatonin receptor 1B (MTNR1B) gene and lifestyle intervention for gestational diabetes have been described. Whether these are specific for physical activity or the healthy eating intervention is unknown., OBJECTIVES: The aim was to assess the interaction between MTNR1B rs10830962 and rs10830963 polymorphisms and lifestyle interventions during pregnancy., METHODS: Women with a BMI (in kg/m2) of >=29 (n = 436) received counseling on healthy eating (HE), physical activity (PA), or both. The control group received usual care. This secondary analysis had a factorial design with comparison of HE compared with no HE and PA compared with no PA. Maternal outcomes at 24-28 wk were gestational weight gain (GWG), maternal fasting glucose, insulin, insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), disposition index, and development of GDM. Neonatal outcomes were cord blood leptin and C-peptide and estimated neonatal fat percentage. The interaction between receiving either the HE or PA intervention and genotypes of both rs10830962 and rs10830963 was assessed using multilevel regression analysis., RESULTS: GDM risk was increased in women homozygous for the G allele of rs10830962 (OR: 2.60; 95% CI: 1.34, 5.06) or rs10830963 (OR: 2.83; 95% CI: 1.24, 6.47). Significant interactions between rs10830962 and interventions were found: in women homozygous for the G allele but not in the other genotypes, the PA intervention reduced maternal fasting insulin (beta: -0.16; 95% CI: -0.33, 0.02; P = 0.08) and HOMA-IR (beta: -0.17; 95% CI: -0.35, 0.01; P = 0.06), and reduced cord blood leptin (beta: -0.84; 95% CI: -1.42, -0.25; P = 0.01) and C-peptide (beta: -0.62; 95% CI: -1.07, -0.17; P = 0.01). In heterozygous women, the HE intervention had no effect, whereas in women homozygous for the C allele, HE intervention reduced GWG (beta: -1.6 kg; 95% CI: -2.4, -0.8 kg). No interactions were found., CONCLUSIONS: In women homozygous for the risk allele of MTNR1B rs10830962, GDM risk was increased and PA intervention might be more beneficial than HE intervention for reducing maternal insulin resistance, cord blood C-peptide, and cord blood leptin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chemerin is a novel adipokine implicated in inflammation and obesity. We hypothesized that foetal chemerin would be elevated in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and correlate with foetal and maternal adiposity., DESIGN: Observational, longitudinal study., SUBJECTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Foetal chemerin was measured separately in arterial and venous cord blood of 30 infants born to mothers with (n = 15) and without GDM (n = 15), in their mothers in early third trimester and at delivery and in amniotic fluid (week 32) of women with GDM. Expression of chemerin and its receptor in human foetal tissues commercially available and in placental cells was measured by quantitative PCR. Associations between foetal and maternal anthropometric and metabolic variables were assessed in multivariate regression models., RESULTS: In GDM, foetal arterial but not venous cord blood chemerin levels were elevated by about 60% (P < 0.05). Venous cord blood chemerin was higher in infants of obese women (P < 0.01). In multivariate analyses, neither amniotic fluid nor cord blood chemerin levels correlated with birth weight or ponderal index. Both arterial and venous chemerin levels were related to maternal chemerin at birth, and arterial chemerin was associated with GDM status in addition. Maternal levels were unaltered in GDM, but higher in maternal obesity. Foetal liver produces fourfold more chemerin mRNA than other foetal tissues, whereas its receptor prevails in spleen., CONCLUSIONS: Based on multivariate analyses, foetal growth appears unrelated to foetal chemerin. Maternal obesity and GDM have differential effects on foetal chemerin levels. Site of major production (liver) and action (spleen) differ in human foetal tissues.

AB  - CONTEXT: Childbearing is considered to be a significant risk factor for developing overweight and obesity. Physical activity might influence weight change via hormonal changes., OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) are positively associated with maternal insulin sensitivity and reduce IGF-1, IGFBP-3, leptin levels, bodyweight gain/retention and birth weight., METHODS: In healthy nulliparous women, weight measurements were carried out and blood was collected during pregnancy in the 15th, 25th and 35th week, and after delivery at 6, 26 and 52 weeks. At 15 and 35 weeks of pregnancy and 26 weeks postpartum, MVPA was measured using accelerometers. In linear regression models, the relationship between MVPA below or above the median with metabolic and weight outcomes was assessed, adjusted for maternal BMI, age and smoking., RESULTS: Moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) decreased significantly during pregnancy, but was very low already in early pregnancy. Insulin resistance and leptin levels increased during pregnancy and decreased significantly after delivery (all P < 0.05). After adjustment, insulin, IGFBP-3 and BMI were significantly lower at 15 weeks of pregnancy in women with MVPA above the median compared to those with MVPA below the median. After 15 weeks of pregnancy, no significant associations were observed between hormonal levels and MVPA. MVPA was neither related to weight retention, nor to birth weight., CONCLUSION: Except in early pregnancy, MPVA was not related to metabolic outcomes. In addition, MVPA during pregnancy was not related to weight retention or birth weight. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of the study was to evaluate growth pattern of small- and appropriate-for-gestational-age children and to identify prenatal and postnatal risk factors for short stature and development of components of metabolic syndrome. A total of 109 small- and 239 appropriate-for-gestational-age infants were enrolled in the study. Within 24 hours after birth and at 2, 5, 9, 12, 18, 24 months, and 6 years of age, anthropometric data were recorded for study children. Cord blood samples from study infants were collected, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF), IGF-binding protein-3, and leptin levels were measured. Birth weight and height (P<0.001) and insulin-like growth factor-1, IGF-binding protein-3, and leptin levels (P<0.05) were lower in children born small for gestational age vs. children born appropriate for gestational age. At 2, 5, 12, 18, and 24 months and 6 years of age, children born small for gestational age remained shorter and weighed less (P<0.001). Waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate at 6 years of age and gain in body mass index from birth up to 6 years of age was higher in children born small for gestational age. Height gain during the first year of life was mainly influenced by birth length and target height. Maternal weight before pregnancy and cord leptin levels were the most significant factors influencing postnatal weight gain during the first years of life., CONCLUSIONS: During the first 6 years of life, children born small for gestational age remained shorter and lighter. A greater catch-up in body mass index and tendency towards central pattern of fat distribution during the first years of life might be predisposing factors for the development of long-term metabolic complications in these individuals.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to evaluate leptin concentration at birth and in early postnatal life in small- and appropriate-for-gestational-age infants and to assess its relationship with infants' anthropometry at birth and some characteristics of maternal pregnancy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 367 infants born after 32-42 weeks of gestation were enrolled in the study. Umbilical cord blood samples were collected from 80 small- and 287 appropriate-for-gestational-age newborns. Altogether, 166 venous blood samples were taken from these neonates on days 2-6 of life., RESULTS: Cord leptin levels were significantly lower in small- compared to appropriate-for-gestational-age infants. We observed a positive correlation between cord leptin and birth weight, all neonatal anthropometric parameters, placental weight, and some maternal nutritional factors. In multivariate analysis, cord leptin concentration explained up to 15% of the variation in sum of newborn's skinfold thickness but only 5% of the variation in birth weight. Postnatally, leptin concentration decreased markedly to the similar low levels in both infant groups and remained so during the first postnatal week., CONCLUSIONS: Significantly lower cord leptin concentration in small-for-gestational-age neonates reflects a lower fat mass content compared to appropriate-for-gestational-age infants. However, an abrupt decrease in leptin levels shortly after birth in both groups suggests that placenta could be an important source of leptin in fetal circulation. The impact of low leptin levels at birth in small-for-gestational-age infants on their postnatal appetite and weight gain remains to be elucidated in future studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The role of first trimester maternal body mass index (BMI) and adipocytokines in cord blood c-peptide and birth weight in pregnancy was investigated., DESIGN: Seventy non-diabetic pregnant Caucasian women were recruited. Anthropometry and measurements of fasting adipocytokines (visfatin, leptin, adiponectin), insulin and glucose were performed in each of the three trimesters. At birth, birth weight and cord blood c-peptide, glucose, insulin, visfatin, leptin, adiponectin and IL6 in each neonate were measured., RESULTS: First trimester maternal BMI correlated positively with cord blood c-peptide (p=0.035, r=0.74) and negatively with cord blood visfatin (p=0.049, r=-0.67). First trimester HOMAR was negatively correlated with cord blood visfatin (p=0.037, r=-0.90) and negatively with cord blood leptin (p=0.031, r=0.90). First trimester maternal BMI was a positive predictor of cord blood c-peptide (p=0.007). First trimester maternal visfatin levels were negative predictors of birth weight (p=0.017)., CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that first trimester maternal BMI and serum visfatin seem to be strongly associated with fetal insulin secretion and final birth weight, respectively, suggesting a role of early-pregnancy maternal adipose tissue in the pregnancy metabolic environment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In pregnancy physiological mechanisms activated by maternal appetite contribute to adequate energy intake for the mother and for the fetus. The role of maternal appetite-related peptides and their possible association with neonatal energy stores and glucose metabolism have not been investigated as yet. The aim was to investigate, during pregnancy, the association of fasting maternal appetite-related hormones levels [ghrelin (active), GLP1 (active), total PYY and leptin] with neonatal waist, percent total body fat and insulin levels at birth., METHODS: Forty-two normal and thirty eight overweight women (mean+/-SD; age: 26.9+/-2.5years; pre-pregnancy BMI 26+/-2.2kg/m(2)) were seen during each of the three trimesters, had blood sampling and a 75g oral glucose tolerance test. At birth, neonates underwent anthropometry and cord blood sampling for c-peptide, glucose, insulin., RESULTS: During all three trimesters maternal weight correlated positively with percent total neonatal body fat while during the second and third trimesters it correlated positively with birth weight. The second trimester maternal active ghrelin levels correlated positively with neonatal waist and were its best positive predictor. The third trimester maternal active ghrelin levels correlated positively with neonatal waist and negatively with percent total neonatal body fat, fetal cord blood insulin levels and were the best negative predictor of the latter. The third trimester maternal leptin levels correlated negatively with neonatal waist., CONCLUSIONS: During pregnancy circulating maternal active ghrelin, a pro-appetite hormone, is associated with neonatal visceral energy storage (as expressed by neonatal waist). By inhibiting glucose-driven maternal insulin secretion, ghrelin might ensure adequate fasting glucose and nutrient supplies to the fetus while limiting overall fetal adipose tissue deposition.

AB  - Context Angiopoietin-like protein 6 (ANGPTL6) is a hepatokine, which, in animal studies, improves insulin sensitivity and increases energy expenditure to counteract insulin resistance. Objective Evaluate in a human population, the role of serum ANGPTL6 in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or its presence in fetal circulation. Research design and methods A total of 190 women (115 controls and 75 GDM) and their offspring were studied. Insulin, glucose, ANGPTL6, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), and retinol, as well as leptin and adiponectin, were determined in maternal serum obtained at term and from umbilical artery blood at delivery. Results At term, pregnant women with GDM showed higher serum concentrations of ANGPTL6, insulin, homeostatic model assessment, and apo-RBP4 (free RBP4) than controls but not of glucose, which remained similar in both groups. Also, in arterial cord serum, ANGPTL6 concentration was increased in GDM neonates with respect to the control group (201 +/- 12 ng/mL vs 119 +/- 8 ng/mL, respectively). No effect of maternal insulin treatment of some GDM mothers in neonates of either sex on ANGPTL6 levels was observed. In GDM, circulating ANGPTL6 showed no correlation with glucose or insulin concentration or with neonatal adiposity. However, in control pregnancies, the variation in glucose concentration was positively correlated with ANGPTL6 concentration, both in maternal and in cord samples, and cord ANGPTL6 was negatively correlated with neonatal fat mass. Furthermore, in control pregnant women, serum concentrations of ANGPTL6 and apo-RBP4 were negatively correlated. Conclusion Serum ANGPTL6 levels are associated with maternal glucose homeostasis and fetal adiposity in normal pregnancy. ANGPTL6 levels in maternal and cord serum GDM pregnancy at term are increased, although its mechanism and physiological role are unknown yet.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The evidence regarding the utility of assessing first-trimester adiponectin (ApN) serum levels in early prediction of preeclampsia (PE) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) is contradictory. This study aims to determine the role of maternal serum ApN levels as an early predictor of PE and FGR., METHODS: A prospective case-control study among a pregnant population who attended their 11- to 14-week ultrasound scan at the University of Chile's Clinical Hospital's Fetal Medicine Unit. We included patients who developed PE or FGR (10 cases per group) and 35 healthy controls. We determined ApN levels in blood samples from these 55 patients using a commercial ELISA kit and assessed the relationship of ApN levels with variables like development of PE, FGR, weight at birth and maternal BMI., RESULTS: There were no significant differences among first-trimester ApN serum levels in the groups. Average concentrations were 8, 6.8 and 10.8 ng/ml for the control, PE and FGR groups, respectively., CONCLUSION: In our study, maternal serum ApN levels were not useful in predicting subsequent development of PE and FGR. However, maternal serum ApN concentration adjusted by BMI was significantly higher during the first trimester in women who later developed FGR. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Dysregulation of maternal circulating adipokines has been implicated in several "great obstetrical syndromes" including preeclampsia (PE), small-for-gestational age (SGA) neonate and fetal death (FD). It has been suggested that adipokines provide a molecular link between metabolic derangements and inflammatory response in complicated pregnancies. Retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4), a novel adipokine, plays a role in obesity-related disorders, as well as in the regulation of the immune response. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are changes in maternal plasma concentrations of RBP4 in patients with PE and in those with an SGA neonate or FD., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included patients in the following groups: 1) normal pregnancy (n=134); 2) PE (n=104); 3) SGA neonate (n=28); and 4) FD (n=37). Maternal plasma RBP4 concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis., RESULTS: 1) The median maternal plasma RBP4 concentration was higher among patients with PE than in those with a normal pregnancy (P=0.03); 2) The median maternal plasma RBP4 concentrations of patients with preterm PE (<37 weeks) was higher than that of those with term PE (P=0.017) and than that of those with a normal pregnancy (P=0.002); 3) The median maternal plasma RBP4 concentration did not differ significantly between patients with a normal pregnancy and those with an SGA neonate or with an FD; 4) Among normal pregnant women, the maternal plasma RBP4 concentrations did not correlate with pre-pregnancy body mass index, gestational age at blood sampling and neonatal birthweight., CONCLUSIONS: 1) Preeclampsia, but not pregnancy with an SGA neonate or an FD, is associated with a higher median maternal plasma concentration of RBP4 than normal pregnancy; 2) Preterm PE, and specifically early-onset PE, is associated with higher median RBP4 concentrations in maternal plasma compared to term PE. These findings suggest a role for RBP4 in the pathogenesis of preterm PE, but not in SGA and FD.

AB  - Leptin regulates energy homeostasis and immune and metabolic functions. Highly elevated leptin concentrations during pregnancy may be associated with aberrations in maternal metabolism and long-term health consequences both in women and children. The objective of the present study was to evaluate whether dietary counselling, probiotic supplementation, maternal characteristics or dietary intake during pregnancy has an impact on serum leptin concentrations in women, cord blood or in children. A total of 256 pregnant women were randomised to a control group (n 85) or to receive dietary counselling with probiotics (n 85) or placebo (n 86). Dietary counselling aimed at affecting the type of fat used and to increase the amount of fibre in the women's diet. Women's dietary intake and serum leptin concentrations were analysed at the first and third trimesters of pregnancy and at 1 month postpartum. Furthermore, leptin concentrations were measured from the cord blood and from children's serum at 1 and 6 months of age. Weight status and dietary composition were the key determinants of leptin concentrations. Specifically, high dietary fibre and low SFA intakes were related to low serum leptin concentrations in women. Female sex and birth weight were associated with higher infant leptin, whereas cord blood leptin was additionally affected by maternal leptin concentration and protein intake. Probiotics or dietary counselling did not affect leptin concentrations. Weight control to recommended levels and modification of diet towards higher fibre and lower SFA intakes during pregnancy may through leptin concentrations provide health benefits to both women and children.

AB  - Background: Adiponectin is a novel hormone with unique biologic functions. Objective: Evaluating adiponectinpattern among children with a family history of cardio-metabolic diseases and risk factors may shed insight into the pathophysiologic mechanism behind these diseases among those at risk. Methods: 101 healthy children, aged 4 to 12 years, were enrolled in this study. Family history of diabetes, hypertension, obesity in both first and second degree relatives were established using Interviewer-administered questionnaires to the study participants' caregivers. Other data collated include the smoking history, occupation and highest educational attainment of the caregivers and birth weight of the study participants. Venous blood samples were assayed foradiponectin using ELISA kits. Data were analyzed using SPSS software version 21 with the significance level for tests of associations done set at p<0.05. Results: Of 101 children, 53 subjects were males (52.5%) with a male to female ratio of 0.9:1. The mean age of all subjects was 7.8 +/- 2.3 years. Children with a positive family history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension and obesity had higher mean adiponectin values than those without a family history, but these differences were not statistically significant. A negative trend was observed among subjects with a positive history of smoking and increased birth weight (p>0.05). No association was detected between adiponectin level and socioeconomic class. Conclusion: Future related studies conducted among subjects of African ancestry should explore the role of adiponectin resistance in the progression of cardio-metabolic diseases.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Animal studies suggest pathological foetal programming of hypothalamic circuits regulating food intake in the setting of leptin deficiency and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We aimed to compare placental leptin synthesis and leptin-binding capability in venous cord blood between IUGR newborns and neonates born appropriate for gestational age (AGA)., DESIGN: Prospective controlled multicentre study., PATIENTS: Twenty-one ultrasound-proven IUGR and 33 AGA neonates., MEASUREMENTS: The concentration of leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) in venous cord blood at birth was determined. Moreover, placental gene and protein expression of leptin and placental mRNA expression of functional and total leptin receptor isoforms were measured., RESULTS: Whereas log-leptin concentration in venous cord blood did not differ between IUGR and AGA newborns, the concentration of log-sOB-R was elevated in IUGR neonates (p(confounder adjusted)=0.009). Placental leptin protein synthesis as well as leptin mRNA was significantly higher in IUGR than in AGA infants (log-transformed, relative gene expression, p(confounder adjusted)=0.004). Analysis of gene expression of functional and total leptin receptor isoforms did not show any difference between both groups., CONCLUSIONS: Leptin-binding capability in venous cord blood is increased in IUGR newborns. Thus, via foetal programming, reduced biologically active leptin levels might contribute to a perturbed regulation of appetite. Copyright © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The human placenta as part of the feto-placental unit may influence fetal endocrine systems and may therefore represent a very important link between intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and metabolic disorders in later life. We aimed to analyze the effect of sample origin on gene expression of placental factors potentially involved in fetal programming in IUGR versus appropriate for gestational age growth (AGA) to standardize sample collection procedure for a multicenter approach., DESIGN: Placental gene expression of insulin-like growth factor-binding protein (IGFBP)-1, prolactin, corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) and leptin was measured and compared between proximal, intermediate and peripheral region of the placenta in 22 IUGR (proven by anomalous placental Doppler velocimetry) and 19 AGA neonates., RESULTS: Whereas no difference in gene expression was seen in the proximal portion, in the intermediate placental region mRNA expression of IGFBP-1 (p = 0.01), prolactin (p = 0.04), CRH (p = 0.01) and leptin (p = 0.04) was increased in IUGR samples compared to controls. At the placental periphery, gene expression of these placental transcripts showed a higher expression level in IUGR placentas without statistical significance, except for leptin (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: Placental sampling site seems to be relevant for detecting differences in gene expression between IUGR and AGA neonates.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with an increased risk for short stature and diseases in adulthood thought to be inflicted by fetal programming. We hypothesized that placental endocrine systems involved in perinatal growth might also play a role in postnatal growth after IUGR. In a prospective controlled multicenter study, placental gene expression of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), leptin and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) were measured in 14 IUGR infants and 15 children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) proven by serial ultrasound examinations. Postnatally, IUGR infants experienced a significantly higher growth velocity than AGA neonates (at 1 y: p = 0.001). Gene expression of 11beta-HSD2 at birth correlated positively with birth length (r = 0.55, p = 0.04) and inversely with growth velocity in the first year of life (r = -0.69, p = 0.01) in the IUGR, but not in the AGA group. There was no correlation between gene expression of placental IGFBP-1, leptin and birth weight, length and growth velocity during the first year of life. AGA infants showed significantly higher concentrations of cortisone in venous cord blood after birth (p = 0.02) as a surrogate of a higher 11beta-HSD2 activity in the fetoplacental unit. In conclusion, placental 11beta-HSD2 gene expression might predict postnatal growth in IUGR.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Neonates born to overweight or obese women are larger and at higher risk of birth complications. Many maternal obesity-related traits are observationally associated with birth weight, but the causal nature of these associations is uncertain., OBJECTIVE: To test for genetic evidence of causal associations of maternal body mass index (BMI) and related traits with birth weight., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Mendelian randomization to test whether maternal BMI and obesity-related traits are potentially causally related to offspring birth weight. Data from 30,487 women in 18 studies were analyzed. Participants were of European ancestry from population- or community-based studies in Europe, North America, or Australia and were part of the Early Growth Genetics Consortium. Live, term, singleton offspring born between 1929 and 2013 were included., EXPOSURES: Genetic scores for BMI, fasting glucose level, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level, vitamin D status, and adiponectin level., MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURE: Offspring birth weight from 18 studies., RESULTS: Among the 30,487 newborns the mean birth weight in the various cohorts ranged from 3325 g to 3679 g. The maternal genetic score for BMI was associated with a 2-g (95% CI, 0 to 3 g) higher offspring birth weight per maternal BMI-raising allele (P = .008). The maternal genetic scores for fasting glucose and SBP were also associated with birth weight with effect sizes of 8 g (95% CI, 6 to 10 g) per glucose-raising allele (P = 7 x 10(-14)) and -4 g (95% CI, -6 to -2 g) per SBP-raising allele (P = 1x10(-5)), respectively. A 1-SD ( = 4 points) genetically higher maternal BMI was associated with a 55-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 17 to 93 g). A 1-SD ( = 7.2 mg/dL) genetically higher maternal fasting glucose concentration was associated with 114-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 80 to 147 g). However, a 1-SD ( = 10 mm Hg) genetically higher maternal SBP was associated with a 208-g lower offspring birth weight (95% CI, -394 to -21 g). For BMI and fasting glucose, genetic associations were consistent with the observational associations, but for systolic blood pressure, the genetic and observational associations were in opposite directions., CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this mendelian randomization study, genetically elevated maternal BMI and blood glucose levels were potentially causally associated with higher offspring birth weight, whereas genetically elevated maternal SBP was potentially causally related to lower birth weight. If replicated, these findings may have implications for counseling and managing pregnancies to avoid adverse weight-related birth outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Previous retrospective case-control studies suggest that adiponectin, an obesity-related hormone, is inversely associated with breast cancer risk, particularly in postmenopausal women; however, no prospective studies exist. Therefore, we conducted a prospective case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and NHSII cohorts examining the association between plasma adiponectin concentrations and breast cancer risk. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 1989 through 1990 (NHS) and 1996 through 1999 (NHSII); adiponectin was measured by RIA. The analysis included 1477 breast cancer cases diagnosed after blood collection and before June 2000 (NHS) or June 2003 (NHSII) who had one or two controls (n = 2196) matched on age, menopausal status, postmenopausal hormone (PMH) use, fasting, and time of day and month of blood collection. We adjusted for body mass index at age 18, weight change from age 18 to blood draw, family history of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease, duration of PMH use, ages at menarche and first birth, and parity. Results: Although we observed no association between adiponectin and breast cancer risk overall, there was a nearly significant interaction by menopausal status (P = 0.08), with a relative risk, top vs. bottom quartile of 0.73 (95% confidence interval, 0.55 - 0.98; P trend = 0.08) among postmenopausal women and 1.30 (95% confidence interval, 0.80 - 2.10; P trend = 0.09) for premenopausal women. Among postmenopausal women, adiponectin appeared more strongly inversely associated in women who never used PMH (P heterogeneity = 0.05) and women with low circulating estradiol levels (P heterogeneity = 0.05). Discussion: Our results suggest that adiponectin may be inversely associated with postmenopausal breast cancer risk, particularly in a low-estrogen environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin is secreted from adipose tissue and plays an important role in obesity. Recent studies have shown that the relationship between Leptin and body fat mass may have ethnic differences. The purpose of our study was to investigate the relationship between venous umbilical cord plasma Leptin and anthropometric markers in term healthy Taiwanese newborns., METHODS: Umbilical venous plasma samples were obtained from 98 term neonates (48 males and 50 females) and leptin Levels were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: Umbilical cord plasma Levels of leptin were significantly higher in the female neonates than in males (p<0.001). The large-for-gestationaL age and appropriate-for-gestational age newborns had significantly higher Leptin cord plasma levels than the small-for-gestational age newborns (p<0.01 and p<0.05, respectively). In both male and female neonates, umbilical Leptin Levels showed significant positive correlations with birth weight and birth Length. Multiple Linear regression analysis revealed that birth weight was the only significant predictor of umbilical cord plasma Leptin levels in both male and female neonates. However, the slopes of the regressions between Leptin and birth weight in male and female neonates were not different., CONCLUSION: In Taiwanese healthy term neonates, leptin umbilical cord plasma Levels are associated with sex and birth weight of the neonate. The relationship between Leptin and birth weight may differ among different ethnic groups. These findings imply that the relationship between leptin and body fat mass may develop early in life.

AB  - Vitamin D status correct monitoring during pregnancy is critically important for both maternal and fetal health. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) - a prohormone of a biologically active 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D), despite the lack of biological activity, during the past decades has been routinely used as a main biomarker characterizing vitamin D status. About 85% of 25(OH)D in the bloodstream is bound to its specific carrier - vitamin D-binding protein (DBP), the remaining 15% are loosely bound to albumin, and only less than 0.1% are free in the circulation ("free 25(OH)D"). Total 25(OH)D is the sum of DBP-bound, albumin-bound and free 25(OH)D. According to a "free hormone hypothesis", only free 25(OH)D is able to induce a biological effect. Normal pregnancy is characterized by elevated serum DBP levels, and due to this fact the diagnostic strength of serum total 25(OH)D has been questioned. Free 25(OH)D might be a better characteristic of vitamin D status in this settings. We aimed to compare the diagnostic strength of a routine total 25(OH)D with directly measured free 25(OH) D in normal pregnancy by comparing the association strength between free and total 25(OH)D with biomarkers of bone health (PTH, calcium, bonespecific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP)), lipid metabolism (adiponectin, LDL, HDL), kidney function (urea), endocrine parameters (T4, T3, TSH), and group B water-soluble vitamins. The study was conducted in 368 healthy white pregnant women residents of north-east Germany. Free 25(OH)D showed an overall better associations with gestational age, markers of bone metabolism (calcium (rho = 0.141, p = 0.007 with free 25(OH)D; rho = 0.060, p = 0.251 with total 25(OH)D) and BSAP (rho = -0.203, p < 0.001 with free 25(OH)D; rho = -0.108, p = 0.038 with total 25(OH)D), lipid metabolism parameters (adiponectin (rho = 0.142, p = 0.008 with free 25(OH)D; rho = 0.054, p = 0.307 with total 25(OH)D), LDL cholesterol (rho = -0.191, p < 0.001 with free 25(OH)D; rho = 0.033, p = 0.539 with total 25(OH)D)) and a kidney function marker (urea (rho = 0.114, p = 0.032 with free 25(OH)D; rho = 0.008, p = 0.887 with total 25(OH)D)) than total 25(OH)D. In conclusion, the current study revealed that free 25(OH)D is a more precise determinant of the vitamin D status during normal human pregnancy than total 25(OH)D. In the settings of normal pregnancy, free 25(OH)D revealed better associations with markers of bone metabolism (calcium, BSAP), lipid metabolism (adiponectin, LDL cholesterol, LDL/HDL ratio) and kidney function (urea) than total 25(OH)D.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To examine the epidemiological data on obesity and leukemia; evaluate the effect of obesity on leukemia outcomes in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) survivors; assess the potential mechanisms through which obesity may increase the risk of leukemia; and provide the effects of obesity management on leukemia. Preventive (diet, physical exercise, obesity pharmacotherapy, bariatric surgery) measures, repurposing drugs, candidate therapeutic agents targeting oncogenic pathways of obesity and insulin resistance in leukemia as well as challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic are also discussed., RECENT FINDINGS: Obesity has been implicated in the development of 13 cancers, such as breast, endometrial, colon, renal, esophageal cancers, and multiple myeloma. Leukemia is estimated to account for approximately 2.5% and 3.1% of all new cancer incidence and mortality, respectively, while it represents the most frequent cancer in children younger than 5 years. Current evidence indicates that obesity may have an impact on the risk of leukemia. Increased birthweight may be associated with the development of childhood leukemia. Obesity is also associated with worse outcomes and increased mortality in leukemic patients. However, there are several limitations and challenges in meta-analyses and epidemiological studies. In addition, weight gain may occur in a substantial number of childhood ALL survivors while the majority of studies have documented an increased risk of relapse and mortality among patients with childhood ALL and obesity. The main pathophysiological pathways linking obesity to leukemia include bone marrow adipose tissue; hormones such as insulin and the insulin-like growth factor system as well as sex hormones; pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha; adipocytokines, such as adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin; dyslipidemia and lipid signaling; chronic low-grade inflammation and oxidative stress; and other emerging mechanisms. Obesity represents a risk factor for leukemia, being among the only known risk factors that could be prevented or modified through weight loss, healthy diet, and physical exercise. Pharmacological interventions, repurposing drugs used for cardiometabolic comorbidities, and bariatric surgery may be recommended for leukemia and obesity-related cancer prevention. Copyright © 2023.

AB  - This study aimed to gain new insights into both systemic and placental leptin and its receptors, with reference to the maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI). Thus, 84 women (29 lean, 24 overweight, and 31 obese) were recruited and maternal, cord blood, and placental tissues collected prior to term labor. Plasma levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and for placenta, immunohistochemistry and messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were quantitated. We confirmed that maternal leptin increased linearly as the soluble receptor decreased with BMI (P = .001). Fetal leptin increased with maternal BMI (P = .02) and birth weight (P = .006) and was higher in female infants (P < .001). Placental mRNA levels of leptin and its receptors showed no change in BMI. However, we show a significant (P = .043) linear increase in leptin in the placental vascular endothelial cells with maternal obesity, while leptin in syncytiotrophoblast showed no statistical change. Leptin receptors localized to syncytiotrophoblast and intravillous macrophages and were unchanged with BMI. Copyright © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with antidiabetic, antiatherosclerotic, and antiinflammatory properties. This study investigated the relations between maternal adiponectin concentration and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and other metabolic parameters during midpregnancy., METHODS: Two-hour 75-g oral glucose tolerance tests were performed in 253 pregnant women at 24 to 31 wk of gestation. Two hundred nineteen who had normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 34 women who had GDM and their newborns were investigated. Fasting maternal blood samples were drawn to determine plasma concentrations of adiponectin, glucose, insulin, C-peptide, free fatty acid, and blood lipids. Blood samples at 1 and 2 h after an oral glucose load were obtained to measure plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide concentrations., RESULTS: Plasma adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower in women who had GDM than in those who had NGT (P = 0.014). Maternal age, body mass index (before pregnancy and at blood collection), and plasma level of free fatty acid were significantly greater in those who had GDM than in those who had NGT. Logistic regression analysis showed that maternal adiponectin level and GDM were significantly correlated (P = 0.043), but that the correlation became weaker (P = 0.116) after adjusting for maternal body mass index and plasma level of free fatty acid before pregnancy. In the NGT group, maternal adiponectin concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with plasma fasting insulin, fasting C-peptide, fasting C-peptide/fasting glucose ratio, 2-h glucose, triacylglycerol, and maternal body mass index and positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. In the GDM group, maternal adiponectin level was negatively correlated with neonatal birth weight., CONCLUSIONS: Midpregnancy hypoadiponectinemia may be associated with a higher risk of GDM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is negatively associated with leptin, insulin and obesity in children and adults. Whereas increases in fetal insulin and leptin are associated with increased weight and adiposity at birth, the role of adiponectin in fetal growth has not yet been determined. The aims of this study were to examine the relationships between adiponectin and insulin, leptin, weight and adiposity at birth in healthy term infants., DESIGN AND METHODS: Anthropometric parameters including weight, length, circumferences and skinfold thickness were measured, and plasma lipid profiles, insulin, leptin and adiponectin concentrations in cord blood samples from 226 singleton infants born at term after uncomplicated pregnancies were assayed., RESULTS: Cord plasma adiponectin, leptin and insulin levels correlated significantly and positively with birthweight (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively) and the sum of skinfold thicknesses (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, P < 0.001, respectively). Mean cord plasma adiponectin and leptin levels, but not insulin level, were significantly higher in large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants. Cord plasma leptin concentration, but not adiponectin concentration, was significantly higher in female infants than in male infants (P = 0.003 and P = 0.94, respectively). Cord plasma adiponectin concentration correlated positively with leptin level (P = 0.007) but not with insulin level (P = 0.78)., CONCLUSIONS: High adiponectin levels are present in the cord blood. Cord plasma adiponectin and leptin levels are positively correlated with birthweight and adiposity. This suggests that adiponectin may be involved in regulating fetal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assays based on multiplex immunoassay (MIA) technology have demonstrated advantages over enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and radioimmunoassay (RIA). Its acceptance depends on how well it performs in comparison to older techniques. The aim is to compare the results of leptin using RIA versus MIA., METHODS: We analyzed 81 samples of umbilical cord blood of healthy term newborns by RIA and MIA., RESULTS: The concordance correlation coefficient was 0.158 (95% CI 0.10-0.21). Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.6651 (95% CI 0.52-0.77; P < 0.0001). In the Bland-Altman plot, concordance is acceptable because most of the measurements are within a mean of +/-1.96 SD., CONCLUSIONS: As shown by the Bland-Altman plot, there is concordance by both methods, but with a weak correlation.

AB  - In the development of the foetal immune system, cytokines play an important role in its function. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the mode of delivery affects the expression of leptin, IL-6 and TNF-alpha in umbilical cord blood in healthy term newborns. We collected 125 samples of umbilical cord blood to analyse leptin, IL-6 y TNF-alpha levels with multiplex immunoassay (MIA). The samples were classified according to mode of delivery: vaginal delivery (VD) and caesarean section (CS). Leptin and IL-6 had higher concentrations in umbilical cord blood in VD than in CS: 42.55 ng/ml (11.92-104.28) versus 35.20 ng/ml (3.26-9326.76), p = 0.039; 9.32 pg/ml (1.13-2020.31) versus 3.81 pg/ml (0.52-834.69) p < 0.001, respectively. Also, a weak correlation between TNF-alpha and IL-6 was found (r = 0.238, p = 0.007). The most important finding in our study was the differential concentrations of leptin and IL-6 according to mode of delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most adipose tissue programming is realized in early life. Also, the postnatal three months, rather than the later phases of infancy, may be more relevant in the development of an adverse cardiometabolic risk profile. The adipokines phenotype, as a predictor of early-life weight gain, has been recently explored in cord blood. To determine whether in addition to leptin levels in cord samples, adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), resistin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) levels improve weight gain prediction during the first three months of life., METHODS: Adiponectin, IL-6, MCP-1, leptin, resistin, PAI-1, and TNF-alpha were measured by multiplex immunoassay in a subsample of 86 healthy term newborns., RESULTS: Leptin levels significantly predicted weight gain at 3 months of follow-up (r2=0.09, p=0.006). In the multivariate analysis, including additional adipokines in the model, stepwise or all at once, did not increase the prediction of weight gain after the first three months of life., CONCLUSION: Adding adiponectin, IL-6, MCP-1, resistin, PAI-1, and TNF-alpha to the prediction model of weight gain in healthy newborns did not prove to be useful. It is probable that their relative contribution to weight gain is not important. Only leptin was relevant as a predictor of weight gain at the 3-month endpoint.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight gain in infancy depends on in utero nutritional status, with postnatal growth also dependent on feeding practices, culture, food accessibility and parents' education., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the relationship between umbilical cord blood leptin levels and feeding mode (breast-fed vs. formula) on weight gain at three months of life., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ninety-nine full-term newborns (male, n = 48; female, n = 51) were included in two groups according to feeding type: breast-fed (n = 49) and formula-fed (n = 50). Leptin was measured in blood obtained from the umbilical cord vein., RESULTS: Umbilical cord leptin levels and weight gain at three months had a significant inverse correlation in formula-fed infants (r = -0.294, P = 0.038). This finding was not reflected in breast-fed infants (r = -0.212, P = 0.144)., CONCLUSIONS: In our Mexican breastfeeding cohort, umbilical cord leptin levels were a significant predictor of weight gain in formula-fed infants.

AB  - Sex-based differences in serum leptin concentrations have been reported in adolescence and adulthood. To discover when such differences were generated, serum leptin concentrations were measured in umbilical cord blood from 46 healthy infants and in the mother's blood at delivery. Considering the respective body weights of the mothers and infants (68.5 +/- 1.3 kg and 3.3 +/- 0.0 kg), umbilical cord concentrations of leptin were disproportionately high in the infants (9.4 +/- 1.2 micrograms/l) compared with those in the mothers (18.7 +/- 1.3 micrograms/l). There was a wide variation in the infants leptin values (1.2 +/- 56.8 micrograms/l) that did not correlate with height, weight, cephalic circumference, or any other growth-related parameter. The most striking differences emerged when results were analysed by sex: umbilical cord concentrations of leptin in the girls (12.9 +/- 2.2 micrograms/l) were significantly (P < 0.01) greater than those in the boys (6.8 +/- 0.9 micrograms/l), although no differences in leptin concentrations were observed between the mothers who gave birth to a girl (19.5 +/- 2.2 micrograms/l) and those who gave birth to a boy (18.1 +/- 1.7 micrograms/l). The sex-based differences were not attributable to any growth-related differences between the sexes, except heavier placental weights in the girls (P < 0.007) than in the boys. These differences in leptin concentrations may reflect a sex-based difference in the regulation of leptin production by the fetal adipose tissue.

AB  - Being born small for gestational age (SGA), a proxy for intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), and prenatal famine exposure are both associated with a greater risk of metabolic disease. Both associations have been hypothesized to involve epigenetic mechanisms. We investigated whether prenatal growth restriction early in pregnancy was associated with changes in DNA methylation at loci that were previously shown to be sensitive to early gestational famine exposure. We compared 38 individuals born preterm (< 32 weeks) and with a birth weight too low for their gestational age (-1SDS) and a normal postnatal growth (>-1SDS at 3 months post term; AGA). The SGA individuals were not only lighter at birth, but also had a smaller length (P=3.3x10 (-13) ) and head circumference at birth (P=4.1x10 (-13) ). The DNA methylation levels of IGF2, GNASAS, INSIGF and LEP were 48.5%, 47.5%, 79.4% and 25.7% respectively. This was not significantly different between SGA and AGA individuals. Risk factors for being born SGA, including preeclampsia and maternal smoking, were also not associated with DNA methylation at these loci. Growth restriction early in development is not associated with DNA methylation at loci shown to be affected by prenatal famine exposure. Our and previous results by others indicate that prenatal growth restriction and famine exposure may be associated with different epigenetic changes or non epigenetic mechanisms that may lead to similar later health outcomes.

AB  - Preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction are both characterized by placental malfunction. The pathological processes of abnormal trophoblast invasion, partial absence of maternal spiral artery modification, increased apoptosis of trophoblast cells, and placental ischemia are all associated with the release of specific molecules. These proteins, as well as cell-free fetal DNA and RNA might be detected in the maternal peripheral circulation, quantified, and used for early identification and prediction of preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction, prior to the appearance of the clinical symptoms. As preeclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction are associated with increased maternal, perinatal, and neonatal morbidity and mortality, early identification of these pregnancy associated complications will permit the design of appropriate preventive measures. In this review a variety of factors reported to be useful as potential markers for early detection of pregnancies at increased risk will be discussed. Molecules associated with the establishment of the placenta and essential in fetal-maternal interactions, like interleukin 2-receptor, insulinlike growth factor-1, and insulinlike growth factor binding protein-1, placenta growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, inhibin A, activin A, and human chorionic gonadotrophin seem to be the most likely candidates for presymptomatic markers for preeclampsia and/or intrauterine growth restriction. Detection and discrimination of these molecules through the placental RNA in maternal plasma based strategy has become a realistic option.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) plays a central role in regulating the secretion of cortisol which controls a wide range of biological processes. Fetuses overexposed to cortisol have increased risks of disease in later life. DNA methylation may be the underlying association between prenatal cortisol exposure and health effects. We investigated associations between maternal CRH levels and epigenome-wide DNA methylation of cord blood in offsprings and evaluated whether these associations persisted into mid-childhood., METHODS: We investigated mother-child pairs enrolled in the prospective Project Viva pre-birth cohort. We measured DNA methylation in 257 umbilical cord blood samples using the HumanMethylation450 Bead Chip. We tested associations of maternal CRH concentration with cord blood cells DNA methylation, adjusting the model for maternal age at enrollment, education, maternal race/ethnicity, maternal smoking status, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, gestational age at delivery, child sex, and cell-type composition in cord blood. We further examined the persistence of associations between maternal CRH levels and DNA methylation in children's blood cells collected at mid-childhood (n = 239, age: 6.7-10.3 years) additionally adjusting for the children's age at blood drawn., RESULTS: Maternal CRH levels are associated with DNA methylation variability in cord blood cells at 96 individual CpG sites (False Discovery Rate <0.05). Among the 96 CpG sites, we identified 3 CpGs located near the LEP gene. Regional analyses confirmed the association between maternal CRH and DNA methylation near LEP. Moreover, higher maternal CRH levels were associated with higher blood-cell DNA methylation of the promoter region of LEP in mid-childhood (P < 0.05, beta = 0.64, SE = 0.30)., CONCLUSION: In our cohort, maternal CRH was associated with DNA methylation levels in newborns at multiple loci, notably in the LEP gene promoter. The association between maternal CRH and LEP DNA methylation levels persisted into mid-childhood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is a 29-kd adipocyte-secreted protein that has been linked to insulin resistance in obesity and diabetes. The aim of the present study was to evaluate adiponectin levels in the insulin-resistant state of diabetes in gestation. METHODS: Term, gravid subjects with diabetes (n = 31; age, 30.0 +/- 0.9 years; weight, 98.8 +/- 4.6 kg) and healthy, term, gravid subjects (n = 27; age, 26.1 +/- 1.1 years; weight, 91.2 +/- 3.78 kg) were examined. The diabetes group consisted of 11 class A1, 11 class A2, and nine class B subjects. Plasma insulin, glucose, adiponectin, and leptin were measured on samples obtained immediately before Cesarean or vaginal delivery. Data were presented as means +/- SE, and significance is set at P less than or equal to .05. RESULTS: We observed decreased adiponectin levels in class A2 (4.93 +/- 0.58 mug/mL; P = .013) and class B diabetics (3.33 +/- 0.56 mug/mL; P = .001) as compared to controls (8.17 +/- 0.82 mug/mL), while a nonsignificant decrease was also observed in class A 1 (6.58 +/- 1.13 mug/mL; P = .213). When grouping all gravid subjects, we observed that non-Caucasian subjects (n = 42) (5.51 +/- 0.51 mug/mL; P = .003) had lower adiponectin levels than Caucasian subjects (n = 16) (8.88 +/- 1.11 mug/mL). Within the non-Caucasian group, we found significantly lower adiponectin levels in diabetic gravid subjects (class A2: 4.24 +/- 0.75 mug/mL; P = .044; and class B: 3.33 +/- 0.56 mug/mL; P = .005) compared with nondiabetic gravid subjects (7.05 +/- 0.80 mug/mL). CONCLUSION: Class A2 and B gestational diabetes are associated with suppressed levels of adiponectin, similar to that found in other insulin-resistant states (type II diabetes and obesity).

AB  - CONTEXT: Early-life factors (including intrauterine growth retardation) may influence the development of type 2 diabetes. We postulated that birth size is associated with cortisol levels, which itself could alter serum adipomyokines (i.e. adiponectin, IGF-I, myostatin) and glucose metabolism., DESIGN: An observational study with 60 Afro-Caribbean young adults from a birth cohort., MEASUREMENTS: Fasting blood was drawn for serum adiponectin, IGF-I and myostatin. A frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test measured insulin sensitivity (SI), acute insulin response (AIRg), disposition index (DI) and glucose effectiveness (Sg). Body composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Salivary cortisol was collected at home at 0800 and 2300 h. Sex-adjusted correlations were used to explore the relationships between birth size, cortisol and the metabolic variables., RESULTS: The participants were 55% male, mean age 23.1 +/- 0.5 years. Birth weight correlated positively with 2300-h cortisol (P = 0.04), although not after adjusting for gestational age. Gestational age was correlated with 2300 h cortisol (r = 0.38, P = 0.03), even after adjusting for birth weight (P = 0.02). 2300 h cortisol was not associated with adiponectin, IGF-I, myostatin, SI, AIRg or DI, but was negatively correlated with Sg (r = -0.30, P = 0.05) even after adjusting for birth and adult anthropometry. Adiponectin, IGF-I and myostatin were unrelated to glucose metabolism., CONCLUSIONS: Gestational age is associated with higher nocturnal cortisol, which in turn is associated with lower glucose effectiveness in adulthood. Higher glucose effectiveness could therefore be a compensatory mechanism to improve glucose uptake. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity is associated with unfavorable outcomes, which may be reflected in the as yet undiscovered gene expression profiles of the umbilical cord (UC)., METHODS: UCs from 12 lean (pregravid BMI < 24.9) and 10 overweight/obese (pregravid BMI >= 25) women without gestational diabetes were collected for gene expression analysis using Human Primeview microarrays. Metabolic parameters were assayed in mother's plasma and cord blood., RESULTS: Although offspring birth weight and adiposity (at 2 wk) did not differ between groups, expression of 232 transcripts was affected in UC from overweight/obese compared with those of lean mothers. Gene-set enrichment analysis revealed an upregulation of genes related to metabolism, stimulus and defense response, and inhibitory to insulin signaling in the overweight/obese group. We confirmed that EGR1, periostin, and FOSB mRNA expression was induced in UCs from overweight/obese mothers, while endothelin receptor B, KLF10, PEG3, and EGLN3 expression was decreased. Messenger RNA expression of EGR1, FOSB, MEST, and SOCS1 were positively correlated (P < 0.05) with mother's first-trimester body fat mass (%)., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a positive association between maternal obesity and changes in UC gene expression profiles favoring inflammation and insulin resistance, potentially predisposing infants to develop metabolic dysfunction later on in life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There are few studies concerning adiponectin and insulin concentration in cord blood of very low birth weight (VLBW) preterm and full-term newborns, small and appropriate for gestational age (GA)., AIM: To compare adiponectin and insulin concentrations between preterm and full-term infants, and to determine their relation with birth weight (BW) and size for GA., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of VLBW preterm newborns with GA < 32 weeks and BW < 1500 g, and full-term newborns with GA > 37 weeks born at our hospital between January 2010 and May 2011, was conducted., EXCLUSION CRITERIA: major congenital malformation, inborn errors of metabolism, chromosomal anomalies. Adiponectin was determined by enzimoimunoassay with ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) and insulin was assayed by chemiluminescence method., RESULTS: A total of 127 newborns were studied, 55 VLBW preterm (28 SGA), and 72 full-term (7 SGA). Insulin cord blood concentrations in preterm and full-term newborns were similar. Adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower in preterm than in full-term infants: 1.57 +/- 0.74 pg/ml versus 2.4 +/- 0.22 pg/ml (p < 0.001), respectively. Regression analyses showed that, after controlling for several neonatal and maternal factors, preterm birth was the only significant predictor of adiponectin concentrations., CONCLUSION: Being born prematurely is the main determinant factor for lower adiponectin concentration in umbilical cord blood of newborns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) promote fetal growth. Their availability is modulated by soluble leptin receptor (SLR) and insulin-like growth factor-binding proteins (IGFBP). Studies that accounted for SLR levels when investigating the association of leptin, IGF-I and IGFBPs on birth indices are scarce., METHODS: Cord blood leptin, SLR, IGF-I, IGFBP-1 and their association with birth indices were studied in term newborns (n = 110; males = 60). Data were compared between males and females using the Mann-Whitney U test/unpaired Student's t test as appropriate. Univariate correlations and multiple regression analyses were performed to identify variables significantly influencing birth indices., RESULTS: Birth indices were comparable between male and female newborns. Females had a significantly lower SLR (p = 0.0142), a higher leptin/Ponderal index (p = 0.033) and a higher free leptin index (leptin/SLR) (p = 0.0081). Leptin and male gender positively and IGFBP-1 negatively influenced birth weight (p = 0.0005, p = 0.02, and p = 0.005, respectively) and head circumference (p = 0.0052, p = 0.0098, and p = 0.0183, respectively) when accounted for other variables. When tested in a different multiple regression model, the free leptin index positively influenced crown-heel length (p = 0.0016) in addition to birth weight (p < 0.0001) and head circumference (p = 0.0016)., CONCLUSIONS: In healthy full-term pregnancies, cord blood leptin and IGFBP-1 exert independent and opposing effects on fetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Altered glucocorticoid activity is one possible mechanism linking fetal growth restriction with later insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes. We aimed to investigate whether serum glucocorticoid parameters are related to IR in children born small for gestational age (SGA)., DESIGN: A total of 110 children (55 age- and gender-matched pairs born SGA or appropriate for gestational age (AGA) in a case-control setting) were studied at the mean age of 12.2 (s.d. 0.2) years., METHODS: Serum cortisol, corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), free cortisol index (FCI=cortisol/CBG), and glucocorticoid bioactivity (GBA, transactivation assay) were analyzed and related to serum adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) concentrations and homeostasis model assessment for IR (HOMA-IR) and QUICKI indices., RESULTS: In the pooled study population, GBA correlated well with cortisol and FCI (r=0.681 and 0.586 respectively; P<0.001 for both). Serum cortisol, CBG, FCI, GBA, HOMA-IR, or QUICKI did not differ between the SGA and AGA subjects, but the SGA children had lower body mass index (P=0.005) and waist circumference (WC) (P=0.001). The mean GBA in the highest GBA quartile was higher among the SGA subjects than among the AGA subjects (138.6 vs 96.4 nmol/l cortisol equivalents, P<0.001). In the SGA children, GBA correlated positively with HOMA-IR (r=0.522, P<0.001) and inversely with adiponectin (r=-0.278, P=0.042) (WC/height ratio adjustments), and in logistic regression analysis, higher GBA (odds ratio (OR) 1.3; P=0.013), lower adiponectin (OR 1.4; P=0.038), and lower IGFBP1 (OR 1.9; P=0.010) associated independently with higher HOMA-IR., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that increased glucocorticoid activity and low serum adiponectin concentrations associate with IR in SGA children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to determine whether markers of growth hormone and insulin action differ between children born small for gestational age (SGA) and those born of an appropriate size for gestational age (AGA)., DESIGN: Fifty-five SGA children and their 55 age- and sex-matched AGA control subjects were studied in a case-control setting at 12 years of age., METHODS: We examined serum concentrations of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and IGFBP-3, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), leptin, fasting insulin, and blood glucose. Insulin sensitivity was evaluated by the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)., RESULTS: The body mass index (BMI), sex, and puberty-adjusted mean serum IGF-I concentration was higher in the SGA than in the AGA children (303.4 vs 282.3 microg/l, P = 0.006). The mean serum concentrations of IGF-II, IGFBP-I, IGFBP-3, SHBG, fasting insulin, blood glucose and HOMA-IR did not differ between the SGA and the AGA group. The BMI, sex, and puberty-adjusted mean serum leptin concentration was lower in the SGA than in the AGA children (7.9 vs 10.1 microg/l, P = 0.037). In multiple logistic regression analysis, high HOMA-IR predicted high serum IGF-I levels in the SGA children (odds ratio 8.3; 95% confidence interval 1.7-41; P = 0.010), whereas in the AGA group HOMA-IR did not associate with the serum IGF-I level., CONCLUSIONS: The BMI, sex, and puberty-adjusted mean serum IGF-I concentration was significantly higher and the leptin concentration was lower in the SGA than in the AGA children. No differences were found in the indices of insulin action or sensitivity between the SGA and AGA children at 12 years of age. However, HOMA-IR strongly associated with serum IGF-I levels in the SGA children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early infant weight development influences metabolic regulation later in life. For the prevention of obesity and metabolic diseases, it is important to understand the underlying mechanisms in detail., OBJECTIVES: This study aims to examine the effects of maternal anthropometric, sociodemographic, and lifestyle factors on maternal and cord blood leptin levels at birth and on the development of body mass index (BMI) standard deviation scores (SDS) in offspring up to 1 year of age., METHODS: Seventy-six mother-child pairs were enrolled in this follow-up analysis in a cross-sectional design. Standardized questionnaires were used to collect information regarding maternal anthropometrics, lifestyle habits, and sociodemographic conditions, and newborn weight, or, rather, BMI-SDS, development during the first year of life., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin (beta = -0.222, p = 0.074), maternal leptin (beta = 0.414, p = 0.001), and female sex of the offspring (beta = 0.385, p = 0.003) explained 29.0% of the variance in BMI-SDS changes in the first year of life. Cord blood leptin was influenced by newborn sex (male; beta = -0.220, p = 0.025) and maternal moderate-intensity physical activity in the third trimester (beta = 0.265, p = 0.007, corr. R2 = 9.2%); maternal leptin was influenced by maternal prepregnancy BMI (beta = 0.602, p < 0.001) and weight gain during pregnancy (beta = 0.247, p = 0.004, corr. R2 = 35.5%)., CONCLUSIONS: Higher maternal and lower cord blood leptin levels are associated with a higher BMI-SDS increase during the first year of life. Maternal leptin is influenced by maternal BMI and weight gain during pregnancy, and cord blood leptin is influenced by maternal physical activity; therefore, it can be suggested that an active and healthy maternal lifestyle may play a pivotal and beneficial role in the offspring's weight development.

AB  - Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) is associated with adverse metabolic outcome later in life. Healthy mice challenged with a Western-style diet (WSD) accumulated less body fat when previously fed a diet containing large lipid globules (complex lipid matrix (CLM)). This study was designed to clarify whether an early-life CLM diet mitigates 'programmed' visceral adiposity and associated metabolic sequelae after IUGR. In rats, IUGR was induced either by bilateral uterine vessel ligation (LIG) or sham operation (i.e. intra-uterine stress) of the dam on gestational day 19. Offspring from non-operated (NOP) dams served as controls. Male offspring of all groups were either fed CLM or 'normal matrix' control diet (CTRL) from postnatal days (PND) 15 to 42. Thereafter, animals were challenged with a mild WSD until dissection (PND 98). Fat mass (micro computer-tomograph scan; weight of fat compartments), circulating metabolic markers and expression of 'metabolic' genes (quantitative real-time PCR) were assessed. CLM diet significantly reduced visceral fat mass in LIG at PND 40. At dissection, visceral fat mass, fasted blood glucose, TAG and leptin concentrations were significantly increased in LIG-CTRL v. NOP-CTRL, and significantly decreased in LIG-CLM v. LIG-CTRL. Gene expression levels of leptin (mesenteric fat) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (liver) were significantly reduced in LIG-CLM v. LIG-CTRL. In conclusion, early-life CLM diet mitigated the adverse metabolic phenotype after utero-placental insufficiency. The supramolecular structure of dietary lipids may be a novel aspect of nutrient quality that has to be considered in the context of primary prevention of obesity and metabolic disease in at-risk populations.

AB  - Early overnutrition is associated with cardiometabolic alterations in adulthood, likely attributed to reduced insulin sensitivity due to its crucial role in the cardiovascular system. This study aimed to assess the long-term effects of early overnutrition on the development of cardiovascular insulin resistance. An experimental childhood obesity model was established using male Sprague Dawley rats. Rats were organized into litters of 12 pups/mother (L12-Controls) or 3 pups/mother (L3-Overfed) at birth. After weaning, animals from L12 and L3 were housed three per cage and provided ad libitum access to food for 6 months. L3 rats exhibited elevated body weight, along with increased visceral, subcutaneous, and perivascular fat accumulation. However, heart weight at sacrifice was reduced in L3 rats. Furthermore, L3 rats displayed elevated serum levels of glucose, leptin, adiponectin, total lipids, and triglycerides compared to control rats. In the myocardium, overfed rats showed decreased IL-10 mRNA levels and alterations in contractility and heart rate in response to insulin. Similarly, aortic tissue exhibited modified gene expression of TNF alpha, iNOS, and IL-6. Additionally, L3 aortas exhibited endothelial dysfunction in response to acetylcholine, although insulin-induced relaxation remained unchanged compared to controls. At the molecular level, L3 rats displayed reduced Akt phosphorylation in response to insulin, both in myocardial and aortic tissues, whereas MAPK phosphorylation was elevated solely in the myocardium. Overfeeding during lactation in rats induces endothelial dysfunction and cardiac insulin resistance in adulthood, potentially contributing to the cardiovascular alterations observed in this experimental model.

AB  - Background: Obesity is increasingly prevalent and related to increased risk of several autoimmune diseases, likely via generation of inflammatory adipokines. Prior studies have not evaluated obesity in relation to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) risk. We prospectively evaluated whether obesity was associated with increased SLE risk among women in the U.S. Nurses' Health Study cohorts. Methods: We conducted a prospective cohort study among 238,130 women in the Nurses' Health Studies (NHS, 1976-2012; NHSII, 1989-2013). Incident SLE was confirmed by American College of Rheumatology 1997 criteria and validated through medical record review. Body mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) was calculated at baseline and on biennial questionnaires. Cox proportional hazards models estimated HRs (95% CIs) for SLE by cumulative average BMI category {18.5 to <25 [normal (reference)], 25 to <30 (overweight), >= 30 (obese)), adjusting for potential time-varying confounders. Models were performed separately in each cohort; results were meta-analyzed. Sensitivity analyses used simple time-varying BMI, a 4-year lag between exposure and SLE risk window to address potential reverse causation, and evaluated BMI at age 18 and weight change since age 18. A secondary analysis started follow-up in both cohorts at similar calendar years when the prevalence of obesity in the U.S. increased most dramatically [1988 (NHS)/1989 (NHSII)]. Results: We identified 153 NHS incident SLE cases and 115 incident NHSII cases during 5,602,653 person years of follow-up. At baseline, 8.4% of women in NHS and 11.8% in NHSII were obese. Mean age at enrollment was 42.5 (SD 7.2) years in NHS and 34.4 (SD 4.7) years in NHSII. Cumulative average obesity was significantly associated with SLE risk in NHSII [HR = 1.85 (1.17-2.91)], but not in NHS [HR = 1.11 (0.65-1.87)] compared to normal BMI. In the meta-analysis of both cohorts, obesity was not significantly associated with increased risk of SLE [HR = 1.46 (0.88-2.40)]. Simple time-varying BMI and lagging the exposure window by 4 years produced similar findings to the primary analysis. In NHSII, a 4.54 kg gain between age 18 and enrollment slightly increased SLE risk [HR = 1.09 (1.02-1.18)]. In the secondary analysis starting follow-up of both cohorts at similar calendar years, the point estimate for obesity in NHS was higher than the primary analysis [HR = 1.67 (0.81-3.45)]. Conclusion: We observed an 85% significantly increased risk of SLE among obese compared to normal BMI women in the more recent NHSII cohort, but no association was observed in the earlier NHS cohort. Secular trends in obesity may account for the differences between the two birth cohorts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Offspring of women with diabetes mellitus (DM) during pregnancy have a risk of developing metabolic disease in adulthood greater than that conferred by genetics alone. The mechanisms responsible are unknown, but likely involve fetal exposure to the in utero milieu, including glucose and circulating adipokines. The purpose of this study was to assess the impact of maternal DM on fetal adipokines and anthropometry in infants of Hispanic and Native American women., METHODS: We conducted a prospective study of offspring of mothers with normoglycemia (Con-O; n = 79) or type 2 or gestational DM (DM-O; n = 45) pregnancies. Infant anthropometrics were measured at birth and 1-month of age. Cord leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMWA), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) and C-peptide were measured by ELISA. Differences between groups were assessed using the Generalized Linear Model framework. Correlations were calculated as standardized regression coefficients and adjusted for significant covariates., RESULTS: DM-O were heavier at birth than Con-O (3.7 +/- 0.6 vs. 3.4 +/- 0.4 kg, p = 0.024), but sum of skinfolds (SSF) were not different. At 1-month, there was no difference in weight, SSF or % body fat or postnatal growth between groups. Leptin was higher in DM-O (20.1 +/- 14.9 vs. 9.5 +/- 9.9 ng/ml in Con-O, p < 0.0001). Leptin was positively associated with birth weight (p = 0.0007) and SSF (p = 0.002) in Con-O and with maternal hemoglobin A1c in both groups (Con-O, p = 0.023; DM-O, p = 0.006). PEDF was positively associated with birth weight in all infants (p = 0.004). Leptin was positively associated with PEDF in both groups, with a stronger correlation in DM-O (p = 0.009). At 1-month, HMWA was positively associated with body weight (p = 0.004), SSF (p = 0.025) and % body fat (p = 0.004) across the cohort., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal DM results in fetal hyperleptinemia independent of adiposity. HMWA appears to influence postnatal growth. Thus, in utero exposure to DM imparts hormonal differences on infants even without aberrant growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate in vitro adipocyte differentiation in baboon fetuses in response to reduced maternal nutrition., DESIGN: Cross-sectional comparison of adipocyte differentiation in normally grown fetuses and fetuses of pregnant baboons fed 70% of the control global diet from 30 days of pregnancy to term., SUBJECTS: The subjects comprised control (CTR) fetuses (five female and five male) of mothers fed ad libitum and fetuses of mothers fed 70% of the global diet consumed by CTR (maternal nutrient reduction (MNR), five female and five male fetuses). The expression of genes/proteins involved in adipogenesis (PPARgamma, FABP4 and adiponectin) and brown adipose tissue development (UCP1, TBX15 and COXIV) were determined in in vitro-differentiated stromal-vascular cultures from subcutaneous abdominal, subcutaneous femoral and omental adipose tissue depots. Adipocyte number per area (mm(2)) was determined histologically to assist in the evaluation of adipocyte size., RESULTS: Maternal suboptimal nutrition suppressed growth of male but not female fetuses and led to adipocyte hypertrophy accompanied by increased markers of white- and, particularly, brown-type adipogenesis in male but not female fetuses., CONCLUSION: Adipose tissue responses to fetal nonhuman primate undernutrition are sexually dimorphic. While female fetuses adapt adequately, the male ones enhance pathways involved in white and brown adipose tissue development but are unable to compensate for a delayed development of adipose tissue associated with intrauterine growth restriction. These differences need to be considered when assessing developmental programming of adiposity in response to suboptimal maternal nutrition.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine in a population sample of cord blood the time structure (chronome) of leptin, an adipocyte-derived hormone, and to assess any effect of a familial history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and obesity, separately, on both the maternal and the paternal side., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Leptin concentration was determined in cord blood from 93 infants. Effects of gender, gestational age, birth weight, maternal weight, familial antecedents of obesity and noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and circadian and about-yearly stage were assessed by linear regression and ANOVA., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin concentration is elevated in the presence of a family history of obesity on the paternal side, but not on the maternal side. Leptin concentrations are higher in spring and summer than in fall and are higher in infants born before noon. In keeping with earlier work, leptin concentration in cord blood correlates positively with birth weight and height and is higher in infants who are appropriate for or large for gestational age than in infants who are small for gestational age or born prematurely., DISCUSSION: Changes along the scales of the day and the seasons point to synchronizing environmental as well as genetic influence. An association of cord blood leptin concentration with obesity on the paternal side may help clarify the role of leptin in parental contributions to human obesity and may prompt focus on cholesterol metabolism.

AB  - Objective: Visfatin is an adipocytokine that functions as an enzyme and a growth factor to investigate the relationship between serum visfatin and the fetus's anthropometric markers up to a year after birth. Materials and Methods: Forty-one eligible pregnant women in their first trimester were divided and matched in terms of body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy into normal and higher than normal BMI groups, A and B. Serum visfatin levels were measured during 6-12 and 15-20 weeks of gestation using ELISA. Results: The infants were followed up for a mean duration of 10.19 +/- 2.83 months. In group A, there was a strong positive relationship between birth head circumference and the first (p(1) = 0.054, r(1) = 0.580) and second trimester visfatin levels (p(2) = 0.051, r(2) = 0.530). In group B, second trimester visfatin levels correlated negatively with birth length (p= 0.015, r = -0.523) and infant's head circumference (p(2) = 0.050, r(2) = -0.392). In a separate study on group B, visfatin levels in the first and second trimesters showed a significant negative correlation with infant's weight. A significant correlation was observed between the first and second trimesters visfatin level with infant's height in both groups, such that this relationship was positive in group A and negative in group B. Linear regression analysis revealed that first and second trimester visfatin levels were significant independent predictors of infant's weight in group B and infant's height in both groups. Second trimester visfatin level was a significant predictor of birth height in group B. Conclusion: Maternal serum visfatin level shows a relationship with fetal and infant anthropometric indicators, with different effects in the two groups, suggesting visfatin dysfunction in the overweight group before pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants of diabetic mothers have been characterized by macrosomia due to hyperinsulinism. A relation has been observed between circulating levels of leptin and the intrauterine growth pattern., METHODS: We studied the leptin and insulin concentrations in the cord blood of 29 newborn infants of mothers with type 1 diabetes (iT1DM), 70 newborn infants of mothers with gestational diabetes and 105 newborn infants of nondiabetic mothers., RESULTS: There were significant differences (p < 0.001) between the 3 groups with the highest leptin levels 24.9 microg/l (range 1.7-94.1) in infants of mothers with iT1DM and the second-highest levels 14.0 microg/l (range 2.6-74.9) in infants of mothers with gestational diabetes (iGDM), whereas the control infants had the lowest leptin levels 10.0 microg/l (range 0.10-45.9). Girls had higher leptin concentrations than boys among the iT1DM and control infants. The insulin concentrations were 18.1 mU/l (range 1.9-123.3), 6.1 mU/l (range 1.1-51.4) and 3.6 mU/l (range 0.5-21.5) in the 3 groups (p < 0.001), respectively. A significant correlation was observed between leptin and insulin concentrations in iGDM and control infants (r = 0.51; p < 0.001 and r = 0.25; p < 0.05). Both absolute and relative birth weights correlated with leptin levels in all 3 groups (r = 0.60, p = 0.01 and r = 0.51, p = 0.05 in iT1DM; r = 0.51 and 0.56, p < 0.001 in iGDM and r = 0.42 and 0.59, p < 0.001 in control infants)., CONCLUSION: Our results confirm the relation between leptin concentrations and birth weight. They also suggest that leptin may be involved in the increased accumulation of adipose tissue characteristic of infants of diabetic mothers. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Aim: Fetal malnutrition is a condition characterized clinically by the inability of subcutaneous adipose tissue and muscle mass to reach the mai amount or by significant intrauterine loss. The major hormones regulating fetal growth, fetal energy metabolism and adipogenesis are insulin, leptin, ghrelin and adiponectin. Cholesterol and triglycerides are very important in fetal growth in the last period of pregnancy. In this study, it was aimed to compare the glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, cholesterol and triglyceride levels in the cord blood of newborn babies with and without fetal malnutrition. Materials and Methods: Term babies born in our hospital were included in this study. Babies with a Clinical Assessment of Nutritional Status of 24 or below were considered as cases with fetal malnutrition, and those over 24 were considered as cases without fetal malnutrition. Glucose, insulin, leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, very-lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels were studied from blood samples taken from the umbilical cord after delivery. Results: A total of 80 term newborn babies (40 babies with fetal malnutrition and 40 babies without fetal malnutrition) were included in this study. Birth weight, glucose and insulin values were found to be significantly lower in the group with fetal malnutrition (p<0.001; p<0.001; p=0.047, respectively), and adiponectin levels were found to be significantly higher (p<0.001). Concluslon: In our study, adiponectin levels in cord blood were found to be high in infants with fetal malnutrition. Considering the anti-inflammatory role of adiponectin, high adiponectin levels in infants with fetal malnutrition may directly or indirectly reflect a protective mechanism.

AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common association with hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance during pregnancy. The adipokines play an important to control insulin secretion and glucose. This study aimed to investigate the association between maternal circulating adipokine levels and ADIPOQ gene polymorphism among pregnant women subjects with GDM and normal glucose tolerance (NGT).Methods: Participants including 229 normal pregnant women and 197 GDM pregnant women were enrolled from 2015 to 2018 at Siriraj hospital. Serum adipokine levels including adiponectin, adipsin/factor D, NGAL/Lipocalin-2, total PAI-1, and resistin were measured by immunoassay. ADIPOQ variations were investigated including -11377C/G (rs266729), +45T/G (rs2241766), and +276G/T (rs1501299).Results: Serum adiponectin concentration was also significantly decreased among the GDM who had aged less than 35 years old whereas adipsin levels were significantly lower among the GDM who had aged more than 35 years old. Also, adiponectin and total PAI-1 levels were significantly lower among the GDM who had a BMI of less than 30 kg/m2. The G allele frequency of ADIPOQ +45T/G was significantly different between GDM and controls (p = 0.03). ADIPOQ +45T/G was associated with an increased risk of GDM (odds ratio [OR]: 1.554; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.010-2.390; p=0.045). The -11377C/G was affected by the level of adiponectin (p = 0.04). The C allele of -11377C/G SNP declined serum adiponectin levels and may be a risk factor for GDM.Conclusion: This study revealed that genetics play important roles in circulating adipokines among pregnant women. ADIPOQ polymorphisms had significant associations with adiponectin levels in GDM patients.

AB  - AIM: FTO is the most important polygene for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Our aims were to investigate whether a variant in FTO affects glucose dysregulation through its effect on fat accumulation or distribution, and when and how FTO influences fat accumulation and distribution and glucose dysregulation from birth until midlife., METHODS: A total of 454 Japanese female university students (mean age: 20 years) and 132 middle-aged women (mean age: 50 years) who were the biological mothers of the students underwent the following: genotyping for rs1558902 in the FTO gene, assessment of fat accumulation and distribution, obesity-related metabolic traits and serum adipokine measurement. A subsample of 364 students reported their weight history since birth., RESULTS: The A allele in rs1558902 was substantially less common in young and middle-aged Japanese women (18 and 17%, respectively) than in the European population (45%). The strong effect of genotype AA on BMI was evident at age 12, 15, 20 and 50 years whereas there was no effect on birth weight. In young and middle-aged women, the variant was strongly associated with higher body weight and fat mass. The effects on abdominal girth, fasting glucose, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance and HbA1c were evident in mothers but not in students. In addition, genotype AA was associated with increased white blood cell counts and hsCRP in mothers only. Associations with fasting glucose, insulin resistance, and white blood cell counts remained after correction for BMI, abdominal girth and fat mass. In multiple logistic regression analysis, AA homozygote in FTO was associated with higher odds of overweight (BMI >=25 kg/m(2)) in young (OR 1.73 (95%CI 1.06-30.0)) and middle-aged women (OR 1.73 (95%CI 1.06-30.0)). It was also associated with higher odds of abdominal fat accumulation (abdominal girth >=90 cm, OR 1.73 (95%CI 1.06-30.0)) and fasting hyperglycemia (>=100 mg/dL) (OR 1.87(95%CI 1.05-40.4)) in middle-aged mothers., CONCLUSION: Despite the small sample size, the low average BMI, and the low risk allele frequency, a genetic variation at the FTO locus was related to greater weight gain before age 12 in Japanese women. At age 20, it was related to general adiposity. In midlife, however, it was related to abdominal adiposity in addition to general adiposity, fasting hyperglycemia, higher HbA1c and subtle systemic inflammation. Fasting hyperglycemia associated with higher HbA1c in midlife was independent of its effects on general and abdominal adiposity.

AB  - Maternal circulating levels of the adipokine chemerin are elevated in preeclampsia, but its origin and contribution to preeclampsia remain unknown. We therefore studied (1) placental chemerin expression and release in human pregnancy, and (2) the consequences of chemerin overexpression via lentivirus-mediated trophoblast-specific gene manipulation in both mice and immortalized human trophoblasts. Placental chemerin expression and release were increased in women with preeclampsia, and their circulating chemerin levels correlated positively with the soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1)/placental growth factor (PlGF) ratio, a well-known biomarker of preeclampsia severity. Placental trophoblast chemerin overexpression in mice induced a preeclampsia-like syndrome, involving hypertension, proteinuria, and endotheliosis, combined with diminished trophoblast invasion, a disorganized labyrinth layer, and up-regulation of sFlt-1 and the inflammation markers nuclear factor-kappaB (NFkappaB), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-1beta. It also led to embryo resorption, while maternal serum chemerin levels correlated negatively with fetal weight in mice. Chemerin overexpression in human trophoblasts up-regulated sFlt-1, reduced vascular endothelial factor-A, and inhibited migration and invasion, as well as tube formation during co-culture with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The chemokine-like receptor 1 (CMKLR1) antagonist alpha-NETA prevented the latter phenomenon, although it did not reverse the chemerin-induced down-regulation of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt pathway. In conclusion, up-regulation of placental chemerin synthesis disturbs normal placental development via its CMKLR1 receptor, thereby contributing to fetal growth restriction/resorption and the development of preeclampsia. Chemerin might be a novel biomarker of preeclampsia, and inhibition of the chemerin/CMKLR1 pathway is a promising novel therapeutic strategy to treat preeclampsia. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood leptin and adiponectin are adipokines known to be associated with birth weight and overall infant adiposity. However, few studies have investigated their associations with abdominal adiposity in neonates. We examined maternal factors associated with cord blood leptin and adiponectin, and the association of these adipokines with neonatal adiposity and abdominal fat distribution measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in an Asian mother-offspring cohort., METHODS: Growing Up in Singapore Towards healthy Outcomes (GUSTO), is a prospective mother-offspring birth cohort study in Singapore. Cord blood plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured using Luminex and Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay respectively in 816 infants. A total of 271 neonates underwent MRI within the first 2-weeks after delivery. Abdominal superficial (sSAT), deep subcutaneous (dSAT), and intra-abdominal (IAT) adipose tissue compartment volumes were quantified from MRI images. Multivariable regression analyses were performed., RESULTS: Indian or Malay ethnicity, female sex, and gestational age were positively associated with cord blood leptin and adiponectin concentrations. Maternal gestational diabetes (GDM) positively associated with cord blood leptin concentrations but inversely associated with cord blood adiponectin concentrations. Maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) showed a positive relationship with cord blood leptin but not with adiponectin concentrations. Each SD increase in cord blood leptin was associated with higher neonatal sSAT, dSAT and IAT; differences in SD (95% CI): 0.258 (0.142, 0.374), 0.386 (0.254, 0.517) and 0.250 (0.118, 0.383), respectively. Similarly, each SD increase in cord blood adiponectin was associated with higher neonatal sSAT and dSAT; differences in SD (95% CI): 0.185 (0.096, 0.274) and 0.173 (0.067, 0.278), respectively. The association between cord blood adiponectin and neonatal adiposity was observed in neonates of obese mothers only., CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood leptin and adiponectin concentrations were associated with ethnicity, maternal BMI and GDM, sex and gestational age. Both adipokines showed positive association with neonatal abdominal adiposity. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that maternal and cord serum leptin concentrations correlate with birth weight of infants., METHODS: Pregnant women (n = 135) of low socioeconomic status who delivered full-term infants were selected from more than 1500 women who participated in a study to identify factors related to fetal growth restriction (FGR). They were divided into two groups based on their infants being classified as having FGR (n = 66) or not (n = 69), and each group was divided further into three subgroups based on prepregnancy body mass index (BMI): less than 19.8, 19.8-28.9, and 29 or more. Sample estimations indicated that 20 subjects per subgroup would be adequate to detect 50% difference in leptin concentrations., RESULTS: Mean maternal serum leptin concentrations adjusted for BMI were highest at approximately 22-27 weeks' gestation (29.8 ng/mL) and declined thereafter until term (25.2 ng/mL). Leptin concentration and prepregnancy BMI correlated significantly. We found neither significant difference in leptin concentrations between the subjects with and without FGR infants nor significant correlation between maternal leptin concentrations and birth weight of infants. Mean cord serum leptin concentration (10.8 ng/mL) was lower than maternal concentrations and correlated significantly with birth weight (r = .61, P < .001)., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that maternal leptin concentration during pregnancy is not an accurate indicator of fetal growth. Cord serum leptin concentrations were lower than maternal serum concentrations and correlated significantly with birth weight.

AB  - Maternal leptin levels in serum and urine, their relations to maternal weight and body mass index, were examined in 9 healthy pregnant women from the 12th week of gestation until term. Serum leptin concentration was found to increase progressively during the first two trimesters followed by a slight decline thereafter. The peak value of 27.6 +/- 15.3 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) concentration was reached at the 28th week. Serum leptin levels during the first two trimesters correlated significantly with maternal weight (p = 0.002) and body mass index (p = 0.002) but such a relationship was absent during the third trimester. Leptin could be detected only in about half of urine samples; its concentrations proved to be independent of serum values. No correlation was found between maternal serum leptin levels and the birth weight of neonates. Maternal leptin levels appear to refer to alterations in maternal fat tissue mass that occur during pregnancy.

AB  - PURPOSE: Low birth weight has been associated with metabolic and vascular diseases, but the precise mechanism is debated. Adiponectin is one of the key molecules in metabolic disease, and a decrease in level precedes the onset of type 2 diabetes and development of atherosclerosis. Our aim is to examine whether low birth weight is associated with adiponectin concentration in adult., METHODS: We conducted a population-based cross-sectional study of 2277 subjects (1661 men and 616 women) aged 35 to 66 years who had their self-reported birth weights and adiponectin concentrations measured as adults., RESULTS: After adjusting for potential confounders, including age, sex, current body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol consumption, and exercise, geometric mean adiponectin levels were 6.63, 6.45, 6.86, 7.05, 6.75, and 7.22 microg/mL for subjects with birth weights less than 2500, 2500 to less than 2800, 2800 to less than 3000, 3000 to less than 3200, 3200 to less than 3500, and greater than 3500 g, respectively. A positive association was found between birth weight and adiponectin concentration (trend p = 0.002). Stratified by current BMI of 25 kg/m2, a positive association was not observed for subjects with a BMI less than 25 kg/m2, but was pronounced in those with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 or greater., CONCLUSION: This study indicates that low birth weight contributes to decreased adiponectin concentrations in adult life independently of current BMI, especially for obese subjects.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Menarche is a milestone of reproductive development, and its timing may be differentially influenced by the growth conditions before birth and those between birth and puberty. The present study explored the relationships among menarcheal timing and markers of prenatal and midchildhood growth in healthy Australian girls., SETTING, DESIGN, AND PATIENTS: A total of 156 girls aged 8 yr from a birth cohort of full-term babies had height, weight, and waist circumference measured. One hundred three girls had dual x-ray absorptiometry performed and blood analyzed for insulin, leptin, IGF-I, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels. Girls were followed up at age 15 yr and their age of menarche was recorded., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measures included age of menarche; birth weight and birth length; height, weight, waist circumference, and body composition by dual x-ray absorptiometry; and plasma insulin, leptin, IGF-I, estradiol, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate at age 8 yr., RESULTS: Girls with earlier menarche were light and long at birth and had higher total and central adiposity and IGF-I and estradiol levels in midchildhood, compared with those with later menarche. Age of menarche was best predicted by combining size at birth and body mass index z score at age 8 yr (r2 = 0.12; P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: The timing of menarche appears to be influenced in opposing directions by pre- and postnatal growth. Menarche was found to occur earlier in girls who were long and light at birth and who had a higher fat mass and circulating IGF-I in childhood. These findings may partly explain ethnic differences and secular trends in the age of menarche.

AB  - Introduction: We studied weight trajectory since birth and dietary intake in Japanese female students majoring in nutrition sciences. Materials and Methods: Birth weight, adolescent height and weight, current body composition by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, dietary intake, glucose tolerance, lipid profile, and adipokines were cross-sectionally compared between young underweight (body mass index [BMI] <18.5) and normal-weight (BMI >=18.5 and <25.0) women with overweight (BMI >=25.0) women as an internal reference. Results: Serum adiponectin (leptin) was the highest (lowest) in 42 underweight women, intermediate levels in 251 normal-weight women, and the lowest (highest) levels in 14 overweight women. Compared with normal-weight women, underweight women had lower weight at birth, at age 12, 15, and 20 years, but comparable height, and hence lower BMI at three time points. Underweight women had higher gluteofemoral fat adjusted for total body fat and weight-adjusted skeletal muscle mass, although absolute and height-adjusted fat mass and skeletal muscle mass were lower. Glucose tolerance assessed by oral glucose testing, serum triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not differ between the two groups. Daily intake expressed per kg of body mass of energy and protein was the highest in underweight women, intermediate levels in normal-weight women, and the lowest levels in overweight women. Conclusions: Some young Japanese women are underweight not because of a strong drive for thinness, but because they were born lighter and remained lean until young adults. Underweight was associated with higher gluteofemoral fat adjusted for total body fat and relative skeletal muscle mass. Copyright © Mika Takeuchi et al., 2022; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Backgrounds: Maternal malnutrition and the resulting low birth weight predispose offspring to various diseases, including adult-onset insulin resistance syndrome. Several lines of evidence demonstrate that calcium (Ca) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance syndrome and obesity, suggesting that hypocalcemia is a risk factor for developing these conditions. We previously reported that maternal Ca deficiency during pregnancy can affect regulation of non-imprinted genes by altering epigenetic regulation of gene expression, thereby inducing different metabolic phenotypes. On the other hand, osteocalcin (OC), a bone formation biomarker, acts directly on beta-cells to increase their mass and proliferation and, therefore, increases insulin secretion. Aim(s): We studied whether alterations in insulin resistance and secretion were induced in offspring by feeding dams a Ca-deficient diet during pregnancy and lactation, and to explore the association between bone and glucose metabolism. Method(s): Female Wistar rats consumed either a Ca-deficient (0.008% Ca) or control (0.90% Ca) diet ad libitum from 3 weeks preconception to 21 days postparturition. Pups were allowed to nurse their original mothers until weaning. The offspring were fed a control diet beginning at weaning (day 21) and were killed on day 180 +/- 10. Serum carboxylated OC (Gla-OC) and undercarboxylated OC (Glu-OC), insulin and adipokines in offspring were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. Ionized calcium (iCa) and magnesium (iMg) were measured by ion-selective electrodes. Result(s): In males, mean levels of insulin, glucose, and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance were higher in the Ca-deficient group than in the control group. Mean adiponectin levels and iMg in Ca-deficient male offspring were higher than those in control male offspring. The serum ionized Ca/Mg ratio in Ca-deficient male offspring was lower than that in control male offspring. In addition, iCa was inversely associated with serum Glu-OC and adiponectin in males. In females, mean levels of Glu-OC and Gla-OC in the Ca-deficient group were higher than in the control group, whereas no significant difference was observed in these measures between the two groups in male offspring. In all offspring, serum leptin levels were correlated with iMg (p=0.0039, R=0.436) and serum insulin levels (p<0.0001, R=0.62), and inversely correlated with iCa (p=0.0025, R=-0.454). Conclusion(s): Maternal Ca restriction during pregnancy alters postnatal growth and insulin resistance in a sex- and window of exposure-specific manner. Increased Glu- OC may mitigate insulin resistance in female Ca-deficient offspring. The present study provided further support for the hypothesis that early postnatal lactation plays a sexually divergent role in programming the phenotype later in life.

AB  - Objective: Placental transport of nutrients is dependent on vascular development, which determines blood flow to the placenta. The ability of the uterine artery to dilate during pregnancy may be specifically related to upregulation of multiple pathways for production of nitric oxide (NO). Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), an L-arginine analog and a nonselective NO synthase inhibitor is associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. In addition, epidemiological studies confirm that the relationships between human birth weight and adult obesity, hypertension, or insulin resistance follow U-shaped curves. We hypothesized that increased ADMA and decreased NO might underlie the initial pathophysiologic events leading to insulin resistance. To test the hypothesis, the relationship between birth weight and ADMA or nitric oxide parameters was evaluated. Method(s): The study group consisted of 41 singleton subjects with gestational ages ranging from 36-41 wk, and birth weights ranging from 1,798-3,822 g. The subjects were divided into 9 infants with small for gestational age (SGA) and 32 with appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Their cord plasma ADMA, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1(IGF-1), and adipocytokine levels were determined using enzymelinked immunosorbent assays. The plasma NOX [nitrite (NO2-)+nitrate (NO3-)] levels were measured using the colorimetric assay. Result(s): The relationship between birth weight and ADMA levels followed a U-shaped curve rather than inverse linear associations expected over a full range of birth weight distribution. ADMA positively correlated with birth weight in AGA group (p< 0.001, R=0.590), and inversely correlated with birth weight in SGA group (p< 0.05, R=-0.741). Plasma ADMA was inversely correlated with adiponectin (p< 0.05, R=-0.289) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (p< 0.05, R=-0.294) in all subjects, while not correlated with NOx. Plasma glucose, ADMA, NOx, and resistin concentrations did not differ significantly between SGA and AGA group. However, plasma insulin, IGF-1, leptin, adiponectin and QUICKI were lower in the SGA group than in the AGA group. Conclusion(s): Plasma ADMA levels in cord blood might be an early marker of fetal growth and insulin resistance. High plasma ADMA levels may represent prenatal programming of insulin resistance, and may be used as a predictor of adult diseases. An analysis of all of these reports would generate that the relationship between birth weight and these metabolic abnormalities in adult life can be described by a U-shaped curve. Our results indicate a possible role of ADMA in fetal life for future disorders characterized by insulin resistance.

AB  - Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) is a nonselective nitric oxide (NO) synthase inhibitor associated with cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. NO regulates placental blood flow, which plays an important role in fetal growth. Many epidemiological studies have disclosed that restricted fetal growth is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance in adult life. We studied the relationship between ADMA in cord blood and birth size. Nine small for gestational age (SGA) and 32 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants were studied. Their cord plasma ADMA, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and adipocytokine levels were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The relationship between birth weight and ADMA levels followed a U-shaped curve rather than inverse linear associations expected over a full range of birth weight distribution. ADMA positively correlated with birth weight in the AGA group (p<0.001, R=0.590), and inversely correlated with birth weight in the SGA group (p<0.05, R=-0.741). ADMA inversely correlated with adiponectin (p<0.05, R=-0.289) and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) (p<0.05, R=-0.294) in all subjects, and did not correlate with nitrogen oxides (NOX). Insulin, IGF-1, leptin, adiponectin and QUICKI were lower in the SGA than the AGA group. Plasma ADMA levels in cord blood may be a marker of fetal growth and insulin resistance.

AB  - Many epidemiologic studies have disclosed that restricted fetal growth has been associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance in adulthood. We studied the relationship of intracellular magnesium [Mg2+]i in cord blood platelets to adipocytokine and birth size. The subjects were 20 infants with small for gestational age (SGA) and 45 infants with appropriate for gestational age (AGA). By using a fluorescent probe, we examined [Mg2+]i of platelets in the cord blood. Cord plasma insulin, IGF-I, ghrelin, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and leptin levels were determined with the use of ELISA. Mean [Mg2+]i was lower in the SGA than in the AGA groups (p < 0.001). Adiponectin and IGF-I were also lower in the SGA than in the AGA, whereas PAI-1 was higher in the SGA. [Mg2+]i was significantly correlated with birth weight, birth length, and adiponectin. Birth weight was also correlated with cord plasma IGF-I, adiponectin, and leptin. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was lower in the SGA group than in the AGA group. [Mg]i and adiponectin were correlated with QUICKI in all subjects. [Mg]i, as well as leptin and IGF-I, reflect the extent of fetal growth. Decreased [Mg2+]i may be involved in the underlying processes to insulin resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between fetoplacental leptin secretion and blood gases., METHODS: We measured the levels of umbilical arterial and venous leptin, umbilical cord gas, umbilical venous blood glucose, and estradiol-17beta (E2) in 89 pregnant women. Correlation between the leptin levels and other variables (gestational age, birth weight, maternal body weight, height, body mass index, maternal body weight gain, placental weight, umbilical cord gas data, and levels of umbilical venous blood glucose and E2) were examined statistically., RESULTS: Umbilical arterial and venous leptin levels were 7.64 +/- 12.76 and 7.76 +/- 13.17 (ng/mL), respectively, correlating positively with carbon dioxide pressure levels (r = 0.446, P <.001; r = 0.406, P <.001, respectively) and correlating inversely with pH (r = -0.337, P =.001; r = -0.247, P =.019, respectively). Umbilical venous glucose, E2, and other factors did not correlate with leptin levels., CONCLUSION: Leptin secretion into the fetoplacental circulation may be associated with fetal hypercapnia, suggesting two important roles for leptin: one for basal control of fetal fat tissue and one as an acute stress-related hormone.

AB  - Background: Leptin is potentially involved in the correction of early postnatal growth of infants having deviated from their genetic trajectory in utero. Aim: To analyse the potential mediating role of cord blood leptin level in the association between neonatal anthropometry and early postnatal growth in the mother-child EDEN cohort. Subjects and methods: We included term newborns with information on leptin, birth weight and length, and weight and length SD-score changes over the first 2 months. The Baron and Kenny method was used to quantify the mediation contribution of leptin in the association between neonatal anthropometry and postnatal growth, considering several confounders. Analyses were stratified to consider sexual dimorphism. Results: A 1 SD higher birth weight was associated with a lower 2-months weight variation of 0.27 (0.18; 0.36) SD and a 0.16 (0.06; 0.26) SD, in boys and girls, respectively. Leptin explained 20% and 25% of these associations, respectively. Leptin did not mediate the association between birth length and birth-to-2 months length variation. Conclusion: Our results suggest that cord blood leptin may not be involved in the negative association between birth length and postnatal length growth but may play a modest mediating role in early postnatal catch-up or catch-down in weight.

AB  - Changes in maternal diet at different stages of reproduction can have pronounced influences on the health and well-being of the resulting offspring, especially following exposure to an obesogenic environment. The mechanisms mediating adaptations in development of the embryo, placenta, fetus and newborn include changes in the maternal metabolic environment. These changes include reductions in a range of maternal counter-regulatory hormones such as cortisol, leptin and insulin. In the sheep, for example, targeted maternal nutrient restriction coincident with the period of maximal placental growth has pronounced effects on the development of the kidney and adipose tissue. As a consequence, the response of these tissues varies greatly following adolescent-onset obesity and ultimately results in these offspring exhibiting all the symptoms of the metabolic syndrome earlier in young adult life. Leptin administration to the offspring after birth can have some long-term differential effects, although much higher amounts are required to cause a response in small compared with large animal models. At the same time, the responsiveness of the offspring is gender dependent, which may relate to the differences in leptin sensitivity around the time of birth. Increasing maternal food intake during pregnancy, either globally or of individual nutrients, has little positive impact on birth weight but does impact on liver development. The challenge now is to establish which components of the maternal diet can be sustainably modified in order to optimise the maternal endocrine environment through pregnancy, thus ensuring feto-placental growth is appropriate in relation to an individual's gender and body composition.

AB  - For overweight and obese women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF) the pregnancy and live birth rates are compromised while the underlying mechanisms and predictors are unclear. The aim was to explore the association between adipose tissue-related inflammatory and metabolic markers and the pregnancy and live birth outcome of IVF in a cohort of predominantly overweight and obese women. Serum samples, fulfilling standardizing criteria, were identified from 195 women having participated in either the control (n = 131) or intervention (n = 64) group of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), seeking to evaluate the effect of a weight reduction intervention on IVF outcome in obese women. Serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and the adipokines leptin and adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) were analyzed for the whole cohort (n = 195) in samples collected shortly before IVF [at randomization (control group), after intervention (intervention group)]. Information on age, anthropometry [BMI, waist circumference, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)], pregnancy and live birth rates after IVF, as well as the spontaneous pregnancy rate, was extracted or calculated from collected data. The women of the original intervention group were also characterized at randomization regarding all variables. Eight women [n = 3 original control group (2.3%), n = 5 original intervention group (7.8%)] conceived spontaneously before starting IVF. BMI category proportions in the cohort undergoing IVF (n = 187) were 1.6/20.1/78.3% (normal weight/overweight/obese). The pregnancy and live birth rates after IVF for the cohort were 35.8% (n = 67) and 24.6% (n = 46), respectively. Multivariable logistic regression revealed that none of the variables (age, hsCRP, leptin, AFABP, BMI, waist circumference, WHtR) were predictive factors of pregnancy or live birth after IVF. Women of the original intervention group displayed reductions in hsCRP, leptin, and anthropometric variables after intervention while AFABP was unchanged. In this cohort of predominantly overweight and obese women undergoing IVF, neither low-grade inflammation, in terms of hsCRP, other circulating inflammatory and metabolic markers released from adipose tissue (leptin, AFABP), nor anthropometric measures of adiposity or adipose tissue distribution (BMI, waist, WHtR) were identified as predictive factors of pregnancy or live birth rate. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01566929. Trial registration date 30-03-2012, retrospectively registered.

AB  - This study evaluated nutrition and growth in relation to plasma adipokine levels in 21 very-low-birth-weight (VLBW) children with radiographic bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), 19 VLBW controls, and 19 term controls with a median age of 11.3 years. We took anthropometric measurements; assessed plasma levels of adipsin, resistin, adiponectin, and leptin; and analyzed the children's 3-day food records. Children with BPD had a smaller age-adjusted head circumference and more microcephaly but no other significant growth differences. Daily recommended nutritional intake levels were poorly met but did not differ between the groups. Leptin levels correlated positively with the body mass index standard deviation score in VLBW children. No other associations between adipokine concentrations and growth were found. There were negative correlations between leptin concentrations and fat intake, resistin levels and carbohydrate intake, and adiponectin, adipsin, and leptin levels and energy intake.

AB  - AIM: The role of inflammation in the bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) survivors is indistinct. We evaluated lung function in relation to inflammatory markers in plasma, exhaled breath condensate and exhaled air in school-aged very low birthweight (VLBW) survivors with and without radiographic BPD., METHODS: Pre- and postbronchodilator impulse oscillometry were performed by 21 six to 14-year-old VLBW children with radiographic BPD, 19 VLBW children without radiographic BPD and 19 age-matched nonasthmatic term controls. Eosinophilic cationic protein, interleukins 6 and 8, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin and resistin in plasma, leukotriene B4 and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate, and bronchial and alveolar nitric oxide output were measured., RESULTS: Abnormal lung function was found in 12.5% of the former VLBW children. Airway resistance at 5 Hz was highest in the radiographic BPD, but bronchodilator responses were most prominent in the non-BPD group. Plasma adiponectin had a modest positive correlation with obstruction and with bronchodilator responses, and alveolar nitric oxide and plasma interleukin 6 with bronchodilator responses., CONCLUSION: Very low birthweight children with radiographic BPD had poorest lung function. The most pronounced bronchodilator responses were found in VLBW children without radiographic BPD. Current detected inflammatory markers had only a minor association with lung function in school-aged BPD survivors. Copyright ©2014 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Adipose tissue produces hormones, such as leptin and adiponectin, that are key factors in energy metabolism. The aim of this study was to assess the endocrine role of the adipose tissue in controlling intrauterine growth, so we evaluated the relationships among maternal adiposity, leptin and adiponectin-pregnancy trends and foetal growth in 48 Large White x Landrace crossbreed sows. Two groups of sows were designated based on backfat (BF) depth at the end of the lactation phase: a Low Fat group (LF, 11.60 mm; n = 24) and a High Fat group (HF, 18.20 mm; n = 24). During the subsequent pregnancies, the same level of feed was provided to both groups. The BF values of the sows were recorded, and blood samples were collected to assess the concentrations of leptin and adiponectin at mating and during gestation. The weights and temperatures of piglets were recorded at farrowing and after 24 h, and their body mass index and ponderal index values were calculated at farrowing. Before the piglets suckled colostrum, blood samples were collected, and the leptin, adiponectin and IGF-1 plasma levels were analysed. The observed differences in backfat depth between the LF and HF groups at mating persisted during pregnancy, and a decrease in adiponectin and an increase in leptin plasma levels were observed throughout gestation in both groups. Plasma adiponectin was lower in the HF group than in the LF group, but plasma leptin did not differ significantly. Compared to HF sows, LF sows gave birth to lighter piglets (P = 0.014). In addition, the weights of 27% of the piglets in the LF group and 14% in the HF group fell within the first 25th percentile (weight <= 1 kg). A positive correlation between offspring weight and maternal adiposity at mating (r = 0.149; P = 0.020) and a negative correlation between offspring weight and adiponectin-leptin ratio at mating (r = - 0.198; P = 0.022) were observed. The morphometric parameters (body mass index, ponderal index) and thermoregulatory abilities of the piglets were unaffected by maternal adiposity. In terms of haematology, differences were found in the IGF-1 level, which was lower in piglets born from LF than HF sows (P < 0.001). The knowledge gained from this study suggested that differences in maternal adiposity, which were due to individual variability and not feeding strategies, influence the plasma concentration of adipokines, thus affecting offspring weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased adiposity during pregnancy may be related to offspring risk for mental health disorders, although the biological mechanisms are poorly understood. One promising hypothesis is that factors secreted from adipocytes such as leptin and adiponectin may explain this association. The current study examined whether pregnancy or umbilical cord blood concentrations of leptin and/or adiponectin a) predict elevated infant negative affect at 6 months (an early life marker of risk for psychopathology); and b) help explain the association between pregnancy adiposity and increased infant negative affect., METHODS: Data came from a prospective cohort (N = 305) of pregnant individuals and their offspring. Second trimester adiposity was assessed using air displacement plethysmography. Concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were measured in second trimester plasma and umbilical cord plasma. Infant negative affect was assessed by standardized observation at 6 months. Second trimester inflammation was assessed using a comprehensive panel of cytokines., RESULTS: Lower second trimester adiponectin was associated with elevated infant negative affect, and mediated the effect of pregnancy adiposity on infant negative affect. This association was independent of the effect of second trimester inflammation. Umbilical cord leptin also predicted higher infant negative affect and mediated the association between pregnancy adiposity and infant negative affect., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to link pregnancy adiponectin or cord blood leptin to infant markers of risk for psychopathology, and the first to demonstrate that these adipokines mediate the association between pregnancy adiposity and offspring behavioral outcomes, suggesting novel markers of risk and potential mechanisms of effect.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study was carried out to investigate changes in the plasma leptin concentrations during preeclampsia treatment and to determine whether antihypertensive treatments, aimed at decreasing leptin levels, would improve foetal outcomes., METHODS: A prospective study was undertaken in 57 pregnant women with preeclampsia (37 with mild and 20 with severe preeclampsia) and 46 normal pregnant women who were matched in maternal and gestational age and body mass index. The mild preeclampsia group was treated with alpha-methyldopa, while the severe preeclampsia group was treated with a combination of alpha-methyldopa and nifedipine., RESULTS: The severe preeclampsia group had significantly lower platelet counts, higher systolic and diastolic blood pressures and elevated serum uric acid concentrations. Pre-treatment plasma leptin levels were significantly increased in the severe preeclampsia group (range 18.3-49.5) compared to the the mild preeclampsia group (range 20.7-45.4) and normal controls (range 8.6-19.2). Post-treatment plasma leptin levels in both the mild and severe preeclampsia groups (range 10.2-23.5 and 11.3-24.4, respectively) were statistically similar to those of the control group (range 9.1-20.7). Estimated foetal weight, intrauterine growth retardation and demise were statistically similar in the three study groups., CONCLUSION: Plasma leptin concentrations were found to be elevated in women diagnosed with severe preeclampsia. However, the exact mechanism underlying the increased plasma leptin levels in preeclampsia and the functional role of leptin in the development of hypertension need to be further clarified. Leptin has a promising future as a valuable marker to identity women with a high risk for preeclampsia.

AB  - Leptin, a hormone that signals the brain about the status of body (fat) energy stores, has recently been shown to play a role in the regulation of several hypothalamic pituitary axes, including the growth hormone axis. To investigate a potential association of serum leptin concentrations and clinical condition in preterm, sick term and healthy term newborns, serum leptin concentrations were evaluated in 104 newborns. Twenty-eight of them were healthy term (18 males and 10 females; gestational age, 37-42 weeks), 21 were sick term (12 males and 9 females; gestational age, 37-42 weeks) and 55 were preterm neonates (35 males and 20 females; gestational age: 26-37 weeks). Leptin values correlate positively with birth weight, birth length, head circumference, waist circumference, hip circumference, body surface, weight/length ratio, and gestational age (r = 0.38, 0.42, 0.29, 0.21, 0.29, 0.40, 0.31 and 0.28), respectively. The concentrations of leptin are statistically significantly higher (p < 0.05) in term neonates (3.02 +/- 2.94 ng/ml) than preterm neonates (1.93 +/- 2.21 ng/ml). Female infants also have significantly higher (p < 0.05) serum leptin values than male infants in preterm and healthy term groups. We also found leptin present in venous blood after 26 weeks of gestation.

AB  - Background and Objectives: obesity and blood pressure disorders are one of the main risk factors for antenatal, intra, postpartum, and neonatal complications. In preeclampsia (PE), the placental hypoxia leads to vascular endothelium dysfunction, cell necrosis, and apoptosis. This condition is associated with the release of free fetal DNA (cffDNA) circulating in plasma. The disturbance of the efficiency of vasodilatation and blood pressure regulation in PE can be confirmed by analyzing the apelin, salusin, and prosalusin. This study aimed to assess the influence of obesity on cffDNA, and the effectiveness of maintaining normal blood pressure in patients with preeclampsia and gestational hypertension. Material and Methods: the research material was blood serum and oral mucosa swabs, obtained from 168 patients. Pregnant women were divided into the following: a control group (C)-67 women; a gestational hypertension group (GH)-35 patients; a preeclampsia with obesity group (PE + O) (pre-gravid BMI > 30)-23 patients. The rest were lean preeclamptic women (PE)-66 patients-(pre-gravid BMI < 25 in 43 women). Results: the cffDNA was observed in 1.50% of women in the C group, in 2.45% in the GH group, but in 18.18% of lean patients with preeclampsia. The cffDNA was detected in 58% of obese pregnant women with PE. The greater the placental hypoxia was in preeclampsia, the less efficient the hypotensive mechanisms, according to an analysis of the studied adipokines. The prosalusin concentration was significantly lower in the PE group with cffDNA than in the PE group without it (p = 0.008). Apelin was higher in the PE group with cffDNA (p = 0.006) compared to other groups. The same results were also observed in the subgroup with obesity. Conclusion: in preeclamptic women, obesity seems to act as an additive factor of placental damage by means of the dysregulation of hypotensive mechanisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To estimate the independent effect of gestational impaired glucose tolerance, defined as a single abnormal oral glucose tolerance test value, on metabolic dysfunction at 3 years postpartum. METHODS: We used multiple linear regression to measure associations between glucose testing during pregnancy and metabolic markers at 3 years postpartum in Project Viva, a prospective cohort study of maternal and infant health. We compared metabolic measures at 3 years postpartum among four groups: normal glucose challenge test (less than 140 mg/dL, n = 461); abnormal glucose challenge test but normal glucose tolerance test (n = 39); impaired glucose tolerance (a single abnormal glucose tolerance test value, n = 21); and gestational diabetes mellitus (n = 16). RESULTS: Adjusting for age, race, parity, parental history of diabetes, and maternal body mass index at 3 years postpartum, we found women with gestational diabetes mellitus had lower adiponectin (11.2 ng/mL compared with 20.7 ng/mL) and higher homeostatic model assessments of insulin resistance (3.1 compared with 1.3) and waist circumference (91.3 cm compared with 86.2 cm) compared with women with impaired glucose tolerance or normal glucose tolerance. Women in both the impaired glucose tolerance and gestational diabetes mellitus groups had lower high-density lipoprotein (gestational diabetes mellitus 44.7 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance 45.4/dL compared with normal glucose tolerance 55.8 mg/dL) and higher triglycerides (gestational diabetes mellitus 136.1 mg/dL; impaired glucose tolerance 140.1 mg/dL compared with normal glucose tolerance 78.3) compared with women in the normal glucose tolerance group. We found the highest values for hemoglobin A1c (gestational diabetes mellitus 5.1%, impaired glucose tolerance 5.3%, normal glucose tolerance 5.1%) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (gestational diabetes mellitus 1.4 mg/dL, impaired glucose tolerance 2.2 mg/dL, normal glucose tolerance 1.0 mg/dL) among women with impaired glucose tolerance. CONCLUSION: Gestational diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy are associated with persistent metabolic dysfunction at 3 years postpartum, independent of other clinical risk factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Besides foetal or maternal disorders, placental dysfunction is a major cause of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Although numerous macro- and histopathological changes have been described, little is known about the precise aetiology and the contribution of foetal/placental genes in this disorder., DESIGN: Placental tissues of 20 IUGR and control neonates were analysed by microarray technique. Four of the regulated genes with possible relevance in the pathogenesis of IUGR and its consequences were further studied in placentas of 27 IUGR and 35 control newborns., RESULTS: Elevated gene expression of leptin, corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH), and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) in IUGR placentas could be confirmed in the larger group by real-time PCR, whereas prolactin showed no significant difference. Accordingly, protein expression of leptin and IGFBP-1 depicted by Western blot was elevated in IUGR, prolactin was not different. Birthweight standard deviation score (SDS) correlated negatively to leptin, IGFBP-1, and CRH, whereas placental weight correlated only to IGFBP-1. Leptin correlated negatively to gestational age of IUGR patients and positively to placental score, a marker of severity of impaired foeto-placental circulation., CONCLUSIONS: As confirmed in a large group of IUGR and control samples, the up-regulated factors leptin, IGFBP-1, and CRH may serve as candidate genes for the prediction of subsequent metabolic consequences in IUGR newborns. These three factors may not only influence growth of the foetus, but might also interact with programming of its metabolic functions, which has to be determined in an ongoing study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal growth restriction is associated with an increased risk for metabolic and cardiovascular disease in later life. To further elucidate mechanisms that might be involved in the process of prenatal programming, we measured the adipokines leptin, resistin, and adiponectin and the GH-releasing hormone ghrelin in the placenta of small for gestational age (SGA) neonates., STUDY DESIGN: The control group included 24 placentas of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns, in the study group were 16 placentas of SGA neonates. Gene expression of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and ghrelin was examined. For hormones showing alterations in gene regulation placental protein expression was measured by Western blot., RESULTS: Placental mRNA expression of leptin was significantly increased in SGA placentas (p=0.0035, related to beta-actin). Protein concentration was increased, as well. There were no differences in placental resistin, adiponectin, or ghrelin gene expressions between SGA neonates and controls. Leptin was the only hormone to demonstrate a significant inverse correlation with birth weight (r=-0.44, p=0.01). Adiponectin correlated significantly with leptin (r=0.53, p=0.0023) and ghrelin (r=0.50, p=0.0045)., CONCLUSIONS: Placental leptin gene expression and protein concentration showed the expected increase in the SGA group. Leptin was inversely correlated with birth weight. Positive correlation of adiponectin with leptin and ghrelin expression suggests an interaction between these hormones in the placenta. However, the unchanged expression of resistin, adiponectin, and ghrelin in SGA placentas and the absence of correlation with birth weight cast doubt whether these hormones produced in the placenta play a key role in fetal programming.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Our aim was to investigate plasma levels of adiponectin, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) in low birth weight (LBW) children and to determine correlations among these adipokines and birth weight and cardiovascular disease risk factors. In a case-control study, the concentrations of adiponectin, MCP-1 and PAI-1 were measured in 180 schoolchildren (ages 6-11 years). MCP-1 and PAI-1 levels were significantly elevated in LBW children. Conversely, adiponectin concentration was significantly reduced in these children. Similar findings were observed after adjustment for current age, gender and abdominal circumference. Because the children with LBW had altered adipokine levels, as well as higher abdominal circumference, HOMA-IR and systolic blood pressure (SBP), we evaluated the correlation among these variables. These analyses showed that adiponectin levels were inversely correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) (r = -0.501; P < 0.001), HOMA-IR (r = -0.293; P = 0.023) and waist circumference (r = -0.317; P = 0.014). The proinflammatory markers were positively correlated with HOMA-IR (PAI-1: r = 0.358; P = 0.005) and waist circumference (PAI-1: r = 0.571; P < 0.001 and MCP-1: r = 0.267; P = 0.039)., CONCLUSION: Adipokines levels were correlated with cardiovascular risk factors in LBW children, and these compounds could be involved in the mechanism that links birth weight to the development of cardiovascular diseases in adulthood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between markers of adiposity and common carotid artery (CIMT) in obese children born small for gestational age (SGA) versus appropriate for gestational age (AGA), to establish cut-off values for CIMT in obese pediatric populations., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out over a 1-year period (Jul 2013 - June 2014). We analyzed 122 obese patients aged 4-20 (mean age 14.9 +/- 2.28). Twenty-six patients were born SGA. CIMT was measured in all the patients. Using ROC curve, cut-off values were obtained for both groups., RESULTS: We demonstrated a correlation between CIMT and adiponectin, leptin and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (r = -0.25, r = 0.279, r = 0.498) in obese children. CIMT in obese children born SGA were significantly increased as compared with obese children born AGA of similar age, sex and body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.0035). A CIMT cut off value of 0.049 cm has been obtained with a high sensitivity and specificity., CONCLUSION: CIMT is a well-known marker of subclinical atherosclerosis and its measurement is a noninvasive and inexpensive method of detecting subclinical atherosclerosis. Being born SGA increases the atherogenic risk. Obese children with CIMT above 0.049 cm should be screened for metabolic syndrome (MetS).

AB  - AIM: Adiponectin, leptin and insulin play an important role in the control of growth and glyco-metabolic homeostasis both during pre- and post-natal life. In order to find out markers indicative of post-natal growth, we evaluated circulating levels of these growth factors in full term small for gestational age (SGA) children, during the first 2 years of life, correlating them with the auxological parameters., METHODS: Fourteen SGA (8 males and 6 females) and 16 AGA (appropriate for gestional age) infants (7 males and 9 females) have been included in this study, recording length, weight, body mass index (BMI), adiponectin, leptin and insulin levels at birth. In SGA subjects, these biochemical and clinical parameters have also been evaluated at the first and at the second year of age., RESULTS: AGA and SGA adiponectin and insulin levels at birth did not show statistically significant differences, while leptin concentrations were significantly (P=0.011) lower in SGA children (median 418.49, range 157.68-903.67 pg/mL) in comparison with AGA ones (median 811.71, range 312.50-3085.95 pg/mL)., CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, at birth adiponectin and insulin levels do not differ between AGA and SGA subjects while leptin concentrations are significantly lower in SGA infants and positively correlated to the birthweight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) is related to a higher incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus. We previously reported reduced adiponectin and increased interleukin 6 (IL6) concentrations in IUGR placentas, which are features of insulin resistance. We aimed to investigate placental insulin receptor (IR) function and activation in human placenta and subsequently the relationships of insulin signalling peptides with placental protein content in IL6, insulin, resistin and adiponectin, and with parameters of fetal growth., DESIGN AND METHODS: Whole villous tissue was collected from 18 IUGR and 24 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) placentas of comparable gestational age. Insulin signalling peptides, suppressors of cytokine signalling-2 (SOCS2), insulin, adiponectin, resistin, and IL6 concentrations were determined by using western immunoblotting or specific research kits., RESULTS: The amount of total IR was similar in both groups but activated IR significantly higher in IUGR. Total IR substrate-1 (IRS1) was increased in IUGR, whereas total IRS2 and activated IRS1 were similar. AKT content was reduced and activated AKT was undetectable in IUGR placentas. c-Jun N-terminal kinase content was reduced in IUGR. Total and activated ERK1/2 was similar in IUGR and AGA groups, and total SOCS2 was increased in IUGR. IL6 lysate concentrations correlated with AKT content and activated IR. Correlations were found also with adiponectin and resistin. SOCS2 correlated negatively with all growth parameters at birth., CONCLUSIONS: IR was more activated in placentas of IUGR compared with AGA; however, signal transduction downstream of the receptor was impaired. The increase in activated IR could be in favour of a compensatory mechanism to increase insulin sensitivity. Close relationships of insulin action in placenta with fetal growth were shown.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been related to a higher incidence of insulin resistance in adult life, which is associated with low adiponectin and high resistin, insulin and interleukin (IL)-6 serum concentrations. This study assessed cortisol, insulin, total insulin receptor, resistin, adiponectin and IL-6 concentrations, as markers of insulin sensitivity, in placental lysates and cord serum of IUGR and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns, to establish relationships among peptides and with growth parameters at birth., DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Whole villous tissue and cord serum at birth were collected from 24 AGA and 18 IUGR newborns of comparable gestational age., MEASUREMENTS: Hormonal and peptide concentrations were assayed in placental lysates and cord serum using specific commercial kits. Concentrations in lysates were adjusted per mg of total protein content., RESULTS: Cortisol, insulin and resistin concentrations and the total amount of insulin receptor were similar in both groups. IL-6 concentration in lysates was significantly higher in IUGR compared with AGA newborns. Adiponectin was significantly lower in lysates from IUGR compared with AGA newborns. Placental insulin and resistin concentrations were positively correlated. Placental adiponectin concentration was positively correlated with the weight of the placenta, birthweight and head circumference. IL-6 concentration in lysates was negatively correlated with birth length, birthweight and head circumference., CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluated the markers of insulin sensitivity in the placentas of subjects born IUGR, showing new potential roles for adiponectin and IL-6 in particular, and suggesting a role for the placenta in the programming of these hormones.

AB  - Importance: The balance of mercury risk and nutritional benefit from fish intake during pregnancy for the metabolic health of offspring to date is unknown., Objective: To assess the associations of fish intake and mercury exposure during pregnancy with metabolic syndrome in children and alterations in biomarkers of inflammation in children., Design, Setting, and Participants: This population-based prospective birth cohort study used data from studies performed in 5 European countries (France, Greece, Norway, Spain, and the UK) between April 1, 2003, and February 26, 2016, as part of the Human Early Life Exposome (HELIX) project. Mothers and their singleton offspring were followed up until the children were aged 6 to 12 years. Data were analyzed between March 1 and August 2, 2019., Exposures: Maternal fish intake during pregnancy (measured in times per week) was assessed using validated food frequency questionnaires, and maternal mercury concentration (measured in micrograms per liter) was assessed using maternal whole blood and cord blood samples., Main Outcomes and Measures: An aggregate metabolic syndrome score for children was calculated using the z scores of waist circumference, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, and levels of triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and insulin. A higher metabolic syndrome score (score range, -4.9 to 7.5) indicated a poorer metabolic profile. Three protein panels were used to measure several cytokines and adipokines in the plasma of children., Results: The study included 805 mothers and their singleton children. Among mothers, the mean (SD) age at cohort inclusion or delivery of their infant was 31.3 (4.6) years. A total of 400 women (49.7%) had a high educational level, and 432 women (53.7%) were multiparous. Among children, the mean (SD) age was 8.4 (1.5) years (age range, 6-12 years). A total of 453 children (56.3%) were boys, and 734 children (91.2%) were of white race/ethnicity. Fish intake consistent with health recommendations (1 to 3 times per week) during pregnancy was associated with a 1-U decrease in metabolic syndrome score in children (beta = -0.96; 95% CI, -1.49 to -0.42) compared with low fish consumption (<1 time per week) after adjusting for maternal mercury levels and other covariates. No further benefit was observed with fish intake of more than 3 times per week. A higher maternal mercury concentration was independently associated with an increase in the metabolic syndrome score of their offspring (beta per 2-fold increase in mercury concentration = 0.18; 95% CI, 0.01-0.34). Compared with low fish intake, moderate and high fish intake during pregnancy were associated with reduced levels of proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines in children. An integrated analysis identified a cluster of children with increased susceptibility to metabolic disease, which was characterized by low fish consumption during pregnancy, high maternal mercury levels, decreased levels of adiponectin in children, and increased levels of leptin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and the cytokines interleukin 6 and interleukin 1beta in children., Conclusions and Relevance: Results of this study suggest that moderate fish intake consistent with current health recommendations during pregnancy was associated with improvements in the metabolic health of children, while high maternal mercury exposure was associated with an unfavorable metabolic profile in children.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adiponectin is a key insulin-sensitizing adipokine acting on muscle metabolism via two specific receptors [adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, respectively)]., OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to investigate the genetic and nongenetic control of plasma adiponectin and muscle AdipoR1/R2 gene expression and the impact of these components on in vivo glucose and fat metabolism., DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Plasma adiponectin and muscle gene expression of AdipoR1/R2 were measured before and during insulin infusion in 89 young and 69 elderly monozygotic and dizygotic twins. Insulin action, and glucose and fat oxidation rates were determined using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamps and indirect calorimetry., RESULTS: We demonstrated a genetic component in the control of plasma adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 gene expression. Furthermore, levels of adiponectin and AdipoR1/R2 were influenced by age, sex, abdominal obesity, and aerobic capacity. Intrapair correlations in monozygotic twins indicated a nongenetic influence of birth weight on plasma adiponectin and AdipoR2 expression. Nonoxidative glucose metabolism was associated with AdipoR1 and plasma adiponectin, in young and elderly twins, respectively. In addition, plasma adiponectin was related to glucose and fat oxidation in younger subjects., CONCLUSIONS: Plasma adiponectin and muscle gene expression of its specific receptors are controlled by genetic and several specific nongenetic factors. The data suggest that the "adiponectin axis" plays a role in in vivo insulin action and nonoxidative glucose metabolism.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The ob gene product leptin is involved in the regulation of body weight and energy expenditure, suggesting a potential role of leptin in embryonal and fetal development and progression of pregnancy. In term infants, leptin concentrations showed a positive correlation with birth weight. We aimed at comparing leptin cord blood levels in AGA (appropriate for gestational age) to SGA (small for gestational age) preterm and term newborns., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety-seven human newborns, 47 females and 50 males, 33 born at term and 64 born before 36 weeks of gestation, were studied prospectively. Leptin concentrations in venous cord blood were determined using a specific RIA (radioimmunoassay)., RESULTS: In term newborns, mean gestational age (GA) was 39 weeks (wk) (+/- 0.7 wk) and mean birth weight (BW) was 3316 g (+/- 473 g); in preterm newborns (n = 64), mean GA was 30 wk (+/- 5.0 wk) and mean BW was 1398 g (+/- 505 g). Mean standard deviation score of birth weight (BW SDS) was calculated as - 0.47. Mean leptin concentrations in term newborns differed significantly from those in preterm newborns (9.21 +/- 2.63 ng/ml vs. 1.58 +/- 0.88 ng/ml; p < 0.0001). In preterm and term infants, leptin concentrations showed a linear correlation with BW (r = 0.46; p < 0.0001) and GA (r = 0.48; p < 0.0001), respectively. Leptin levels were best predicted by an exponential regression model with GA (Leptin = exp(- 4.41 + 0.14 x GA); r = 0.61; p < 0.0001). Using multivariate regression analysis (r = 0.57; p < 0.0001), we found significant influences of GA (p < 0.00001) and BW SDS (p < 0.05) on leptin levels. No difference was observed between leptin values in AGA versus SGA preterm infants., CONCLUSION: These data suggest fetal leptin levels to be primarily determined by GA and additionally modulated by growth restriction in term newborns. We found a dramatic increase at weeks 33 to 35 of gestation and no modulation by BW SDS in very preterm infants.

AB  - Small for gestational age (SGA) children exhibiting catch-up (CU) growth have a greater risk of cardiometabolic diseases in later life compared with non-catch-up (NCU) SGA children. The aim of this study was to establish differences in metabolism and gene expression profiles between CU and NCU at age 4-9 years. CU children (n=22) had greater height, weight and body mass index standard deviation scores along with insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and fasting glucose levels but lower adiponectin values than NCU children (n=11; all P<0.05). Metabolic profiling demonstrated a fourfold decrease of urine myo-inositol in CU compared with NCU (P<0.05). There were 1558 genes differentially expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells between the groups (P<0.05). Integrated analysis of data identified myo-inositol related to gene clusters associated with an increase in insulin, growth factor and IGF-I signalling in CU children (P<0.05). Metabolic and transcriptomic profiles in CU SGA children showed changes that may relate to cardiometabolic risk.

AB  - Preeclampsia (PE) contributes to maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Moreover, it is associated with an increased future metabolic and cardiovascular risk for mother and newborn. Recently, growth arrest specific protein (Gas) 6 has been introduced as a novel metabolic risk factor with anti-angiogenic, pro-atherogenic, and pro-adipogenic properties. In the current study, we investigated serum concentrations of Gas6 in patients with PE (n = 51) as compared to healthy, age-matched controls (n = 51) during and 6 months after pregnancy. Furthermore, association of Gas6 with markers of renal function, glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as inflammation, was assessed in all individuals. Median maternal Gas6 serum levels adjusted for body mass index and gestational age at blood sampling were significantly increased in PE patients (5.7 mu g/l) as compared to healthy, age-matched pregnant women (4.6 mu g/l) (p<0.05). Furthermore, Gas6 concentrations positively correlated with blood pressure, creatinine, free fatty acids, C-reactive protein, leptin, and adiponectin during pregnancy. Moreover, leptin and adiponectin remained independently associated with Gas6 levels in multivariate analysis. Gas6 serum levels 6 months after pregnancy were not significantly different between former PE and control patients. Taken together, maternal Gas6 serum concentrations are significantly increased in PE during pregnancy. Furthermore, the adipokines leptin and adiponectin are independent predictors of circulating Gas6 in pregnant women. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood leptin increases with advancing gestation. Preterm delivery leads to premature separation from the maternal and placental leptin source predisposing infants to postnatal leptin deficiency, but this has not been fully described., METHOD: Blood leptin levels were measured for infants born before 33 weeks gestation daily for the first 2 days, then weekly until 36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). Cord blood was obtained to provide gestational age (GA)-specific standards., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin levels were positively associated with GA at birth, maternal body mass index (BMI) and pregnancy weight gain (all P < 0.05). Following birth, infant leptin levels decreased rapidly (74% decrease within 48 h). The extent of this decline correlated with GA (P < 0.05). Postnatal leptin began to increase by 33-36 weeks PMA, but remained below cord blood leptin levels (P < 0.01). At 36 weeks PMA, leptin levels were influenced by infant's weight and sex (P < 0.01), with females having higher leptin levels (1213 pg/ml vs. 984, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Cord blood leptin is influenced by maternal weight gain and BMI, suggesting an important role for trans-placental leptin delivery. Preterm delivery leads to sustained leptin deficiency through 36 weeks PMA, with the most premature male infants facing the longest and harshest deficiency.

AB  - The risk of hypertension is increased by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) and preterm birth. In the search for modifiable etiologies for this life-threatening cardiovascular morbidity, a number of pathways have been investigated, including excessive glucocorticoid exposure, nutritional deficiency and aberration in sex hormone levels. As a neurotrophic hormone that is intimately involved in the cardiovascular regulation and whose levels are influenced by glucocorticoids, nutritional status and sex hormones, leptin has emerged as a putative etiologic and thus a therapeutic agent. As a product of maternal and late fetal adipocytes and the placenta, circulating leptin typically surges late in gestation and declines after delivery until the infant consumes sufficient leptin-containing breast milk or accrues sufficient leptin-secreting adipose tissue to reestablish the circulating levels. The leptin deficiency seen in IUGR infants is a multifactorial manifestation of placental insufficiency, exaggerated glucocorticoid exposure and fetal adipose deficit. The preterm infant suffers from the same cascade of events, including separation from the placenta, antenatal steroid exposure and persistently underdeveloped adipose depots. Preterm infants remain leptin deficient beyond term gestation, rendering them susceptible to neurodevelopmental impairment and subsequent cardiovascular dysregulation. This pathologic pathway is efficiently modeled by placing neonatal mice into atypically large litters, thereby recapitulating the perinatal growth restriction-adult hypertension phenotype. In this model, neonatal leptin supplementation restores the physiologic leptin surge, attenuates the leptin-triggered sympathetic activation in adulthood and prevents leptin- or stress-evoked hypertension. Further pathway interrogation and clinical translation are needed to fully test the therapeutic potential of perinatal leptin supplementation. Copyright © 2016 Society for Endocrinology.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptin is a polypeptide hormone, and in pregnancy, it is secreted by the placenta and maternal and fetal adipose tissues. Normal leptin production is a factor responsible for uncomplicated gestation, embryo development, and fetal growth. The study compared maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations at delivery in normal pregnancies and in pregnancies complicated by intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)., METHODS: The study was performed in 25 pregnant women with isolated IUGR and in 194 pregnant women without any complications. Leptin concentrations in maternal serum and in cord blood samples collected at delivery were measured by ELISA and subsequently analyzed by maternal body mass index (BMI), mode of delivery, and infant gender and birth weight. For comparative analyses of normally distributed variables, parametric tests were used, that is, the Student t test and a one-way ANOVA. The nonparametric Mann-Whitney test was used when the distribution was not normal. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between normally distributed variables (p < 0.05)., RESULTS: In pregnancies complicated by IUGR, the mean maternal serum leptin concentration at delivery was significantly higher (52.73 +/- 30.49 ng/mL) than in normal pregnancies (37.17 +/- 28.07 ng/mL) (p = 0.01). The mean cord blood leptin concentration in pregnancies complicated by IUGR was 7.97 +/- 4.46 ng/mL and significantly lower than in normal pregnancies (14.78 +/- 15.97 ng/mL) (p = 0.04). In normal pregnancies, but not in pregnancies complicated by IUGR, a statistically significant correlation was established between maternal serum leptin concentrations and maternal BMI at delivery (r = 0.22; p = 0.00). No statistically significant correlation was found between cord blood leptin concentrations and maternal BMI in either study subjects or controls. In normal pregnancies, but not in pregnancies complicated by IUGR, a strong correlation was observed between cord blood leptin concentrations and birth weight (r = 0.23; p = 0.00)., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated maternal blood leptin concentrations in pregnancies complicated by IUGR may indicate a significant adverse effect of elevated leptin on fetal growth. The differences in leptin concentrations, measured in maternal serum and in cord blood, between the study subjects and controls suggest that deregulated leptin levels may increase the risk of obstetric complications associated with placental insufficiency.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Studies have demonstrated leptin involvement in the physiology and pathophysiology of pregnancy and suggest that leptin may be a prognostic marker for some complications of pregnancy although the association remains unclear. To date no studies have reported leptin reference intervals established in normal pregnancy, which could be used for interpreting the differences in leptin levels found in normal and pathological pregnancies., OBJECTIVE: To determine leptin concentrations at delivery, in maternal serum in normal pregnancy and in cord blood and to establish reference intervals for leptin., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed in 194 pregnant women without any comorbid health conditions. Leptin concentrations in maternal serum and in cord blood were measured by ELISA and subsequently analyzed by gestational age (weeks), maternal Body Mass Index (BMI), mode of delivery and infant gender and birth weight. For comparative analyses of normally distributed variables, parametric tests such as the Student-t were used to test the assumption of homogeneity or non-homogeneity of variance and a One-Way ANOVA when more than two groups were compared. The Pearson correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the correlation between normally distributed variables (p<0.05). The reference intervals for leptin were obtained by referring to the central 95% of laboratory test values., RESULTS: In normal pregnant women, the mean serum leptin concentration at delivery was 37.17 +/- 28.07 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 33.19-41.14 ng/mL. The mean leptin concentration in cord blood was 14.78 +/- 15.97 ng/mL and the established reference interval was 12.32-17.67 ng/mL. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations (r = 0.37; p = 0.00). Mean leptin concentrations in cord blood increased with gestational age (p = 0.00). No statistically significant differences in maternal serum and cord blood leptin concentrations were found in regard to mode of delivery and neonatal gender. A statistically significant correlation was found between maternal serum leptin and third-trimester BMI (r = 0.22; p = 0.00), but there was no association between maternal BMI and cord blood leptin concentration. There was a statistically significant positive correlation between cord blood leptin concentration and birth weight (r = 0.23; p = 0.00)., CONCLUSIONS: Reference intervals for leptin in maternal serum and in cord blood established in normal pregnancy could be used in clinical practice for interpreting the differences in leptin concentrations found in normal pregnancy and in complications of pregnancy. The results indicate a strong association between maternal serum leptin levels and obesity and between cord blood leptin levels and birth weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In children born small for gestational age (SGA) with catch-up growth, a higher risk of insulin resistance (IR) and cardiovascular diseases is noted. Ghrelin stimulates a growth hormone (GH) secretion and regulates lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. We assessed gherlin's influence on achieving normal height and the occurrence of metabolic complications in SGA children., METHODS: Ghrelin, insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I), leptin, adiponectin, resistin, glucose, insulin and lipid concentrations were analysed in 134 prepubertal children in four groups: normal-height SGA, short SGA, normal-height born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and short AGA., RESULTS: Ghrelin and IGF-I concentrations were significantly higher while adiponectin - lower in normal-height SGA comparing to others., CONCLUSIONS: The increased production of ghrelin and IGF-I seems to be an adaptive mechanism to achieve normal growth in SGA children. The significance of high ghrelin and low adiponectin concentrations, observed in normal-height prepubertal SGA children, requires elucidation, with reference to the development of metabolic complications.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The insulin gene variable number of tandem repeats (INS VNTR) class III allele has been implicated in lower birth weight, obesity, and insulin resistance. We assessed its influence on birth weight in the Polish population and on the current body mass and metabolic profile in prepubertal children born small for gestational age (SGA)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: DNA for genotyping of INS VNTR was available for 123 subjects born SGA and 132 born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). We identified two alleles: class I and class III. Next, in 112 prepubertal (aged: 6.8 +/- 1.38 years) SGA children, the auxological measurements, fasting serum C-peptide, triglycerides, cholesterol, ghrelin, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, cortisol, and insulin-like growth factor type I (IGF-I) concentrations, as well as glucose and insulin during oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), were assessed and insulin resistance indices were calculated. The results were analysed depending on INS VNTR variants., RESULTS: The occurrence of individual INS VNTR variants were similar in the SGA and AGA groups. In prepubertal SGA children, we did not observe any statistical differences as regards birth weight, body mass, lipids, or adipocytokine concentrations among I/I, I/III, and III/III class groups. The concentration of insulin in 120' of OGTT was significantly higher in class III homozygous than in class I homozygous individuals., CONCLUSIONS: Variant INS VNTR class III was shown not to be associated in any essential way with birth weight in the Polish population. Among prepubertal SGA children, the presence of INS VNTR class III is related to higher insulin secretion during OGTT. (Endokrynol Pol 2016; 67 (6): 585-591).

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) remains a significant concern in modern obstetrics, linked to high neonatal health problems and even death, as well as childhood disability, affecting adult quality of life. The role of maternal and fetus adaptation during adverse pregnancy is still not completely understood. This study aimed to investigate the disturbance in biological processes associated with isolated IUGR via blood plasma proteomics. The levels of 125 maternal plasma proteins were quantified by liquid chromatography-multiple reaction monitoring mass spectrometry (LC-MRM MS) with corresponding stable isotope-labeled peptide standards (SIS). Thirteen potential markers of IUGR (Gelsolin, Alpha-2-macroglobulin, Apolipoprotein A-IV, Apolipoprotein B-100, Apolipoprotein(a), Adiponectin, Complement C5, Apolipoprotein D, Alpha-1B-glycoprotein, Serum albumin, Fibronectin, Glutathione peroxidase 3, Lipopolysaccharide-binding protein) were found to be inter-connected in a protein-protein network. These proteins are involved in plasma lipoprotein assembly, remodeling, and clearance; lipid metabolism, especially cholesterol and phospholipids; hemostasis, including platelet degranulation; and immune system regulation. Additionally, 18 proteins were specific to a particular type of IUGR (early or late). Distinct patterns in the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems were observed between isolated early- and late-onset IUGR. Our findings highlight the complex interplay of immune and coagulation factors in IUGR and the differences between early- and late-onset IUGR and other placenta-related conditions like PE. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for developing targeted interventions and improving outcomes for pregnancies affected by IUGR.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of birth weight with abdominal fat distribution and markers known to increase risk for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes in adolescents., STUDY DESIGN: In 575 adolescents aged 14-18 years (52% female, 46% black), birth weight was obtained by parental recall. Fasting blood samples were measured for glucose, insulin, lipids, adiponectin, leptin, and C-reactive protein. Subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue and visceral adipose tissue were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging., RESULTS: When we compared markers of cardiometabolic risk across tertiles of birth weight, adjusting for age, sex, race, Tanner stage, physical activity, socioeconomic status, and body mass index, there were significant U-shaped trends for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, leptin, and visceral adipose tissue (all Pquadratic < .05). A significant linear downward trend across tertiles of birth weight was observed for triglycerides (Plinear = .03). There were no differences in fasting glucose, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, or subcutaneous abdominal adipose tissue across tertiles of birth weight., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that both low and high birth weights are associated with greater visceral adiposity and biomarkers implicated in insulin resistance and inflammation in adolescents.

AB  - An elevated ratio of n-6 to n-3 long-chain (LC-) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may be a potential risk factor for obesity development. N-3 LC-PUFA are thought to alter adiponectin concentrations, and thus may have a beneficial effect on weight development. We analysed the association between n-3 LC-PUFA concentrations in cord blood and adiponectin concentrations at 10 years. Fatty acid composition was measured in cord blood and at 10 years of age by gas chromatography, and adiponectin concentrations were measured only at 10 years of age in 237 children from the Munich LISAplus birth cohort study. Linear regression models assessed associations between n-3 LC-PUFA, n-6 LC-PUFA and the n-6/n-3 ratio in cord blood with adiponectin concentrations at 10 years of age. LC-PUFA were presented as percentages and categorized into tertiles. Regression models were adjusted for LC-PUFA percentages at 10 years of age and other potential confounding factors. Cord blood n-3 LC-PUFA tertiles were significantly associated with adiponectin concentrations in an inverse J-shaped relationship [2nd tertile versus 1st tertile: Beta=1.84 (SE=0.65), and 3rd tertile versus 1st tertile: 1.02 (0.68), p-value<0.01 (ANOVA)]. Further, cord blood n-6/n-3 ratios were significantly associated with adiponectin concentrations [2nd tertile versus 1st tertile: 0.14 (0.67), and 3rd tertile versus 1st tertile: -1.37 (0.68), p-value=0.03 (ANOVA)]. The cord blood n-6 LC-PUFA tertiles were not associated with adiponectin concentrations. Our results suggest that a higher n-3 LC-PUFA concentrations and a lower n-6/n-3 ratio in cord blood are associated with higher adiponectin concentrations at 10 years of age.

AB  - The mechanisms underlying the association between prenatal arsenic exposure and the development of metabolic diseases remain unclear. Aberrant adipogenesis and adipokine production are associated with increased risk for the development of metabolic diseases in susceptible populations. Generation of mature adipocytes is tightly regulated by the expression of genes encoding: peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARG), fatty acid-binding protein (FABP4), and glucose transporter-4 (SLC2A4), and adipokines such as leptin (LEP) and adiponectin (ADIPOQ). This study aimed to investigate the expression of these genes, which are associated with the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases in newborns and children exposed to arsenic in utero. A high arsenic exposed group showed significantly decreased PPARG and FABP4 expression in cord blood samples from newborns and in saliva samples from children. By contrast, the expression of the SLC2A4 and ADIPOQ mRNA was significantly decreased in high-arsenic exposed children. Furthermore, the levels of toenail arsenic were negatively correlated with the salivary mRNA expression levels of PPARG (r = -0.412, p < 0.01), aP2 (r = -0.329, p < 0.05), and SLC2A4 (r = -0.528, p < 0.01). In vitro studies utilizing umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) as a surrogate for fetal MSCs showed that arsenite treatment (0.5 muM and 1 muM) significantly impaired adipogenic differentiation in a concentration dependent manner. Such impairment may be related to a significant decrease in the expression of: PPARgamma, FABP4, and SLC2A4 observed at 1 muM arsenite. Arsenite treatment also promoted inflammation through a significant increase in the mRNA expression levels of the pro-inflammatory adipokine, LEP, and the inflammatory cytokines: CXCL6, IL-1beta, and CXCL8. Collectively, our results suggests that such alterations may be a consequence of the effects of arsenic exposure on fetal MSCs eventually leading to impaired adipogenic differentiation and the promotion of inflammation, both of which contribute to the development of metabolic diseases later in life.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) leads to offspring obesity. In a maternal food restriction (MFR) during pregnancy-related IUGR rat model, bone marrow stem cells showed enhanced adipogenic programming; however, the effect of IUGR on white adipose tissue (WAT) progenitors is unknown. Here, by mRNA and functional profiling, we determined sex-specific adipogenic programming of WAT progenitors isolated from pups on the postnatal day (PND) 1 and 21. On PND1, PPAR gamma and Pref-1 expression was significantly downregulated in preadipocytes of both MFR males and females; however, at PND21, preadipocytes of MFR males showed upregulation in these genes. Even following adipogenic induction, both male and female MFR adipocytes exhibited lower PPAR gamma, ADRP, and adiponectin levels at PND1; however, at PND21 MFR male adipocytes showed an upward trend in the expression of these genes. An adipogenesis-specific RT-PCR array showed that male MFR adipocytes were programmed to exhibit stronger adipogenic propensity than females. Last, serum sex hormone and adipocyte estrogen/testosterone receptor expression profiles provide preliminary insights into the possible mechanism underlying sex-specific adipogenic programming in the IUGR offspring. In summary, IUGR programs WAT preadipocytes to greater adipogenic potential in males. Although the altered adipogenic programming following MFR was detectable at PND1, the changes were more pronounced at PND21, suggesting a potential role of postnatal nutrition in facilitating the sex-specific adipogenic programming in the IUGR offspring.

AB  - Aims Adiponectin, visfatin, and omentin have been shown to be associated with insulin sensitivity and might have a role in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to (1) compare adiponectin, visfatin, and omentin mRNA expressions in placenta and their serum levels between normal pregnancy (NP) and GDM class A1 (GDMA1) pregnancy and (2) determine correlations between placental gene expressions as well as serum levels with maternal and neonatal clinical parameters in all, NP, and GDM subjects. Methods NP subjects (n = 37), who had normal medical history during their pregnancies without diagnosis of any abnormalities and GDMA1 subjects (n = 37), who were diagnosed since they had antenatal care, were recruited when they were in labor with a gestational age of at least 34 weeks. Clinical parameters and serum adiponectin, visfatin, and omentin levels were measured in the delivery room. Results GDMA1 subjects had higher serum visfatin and plasma glucose levels, but lower serum omentin levels (p < 0.05 all) compared to controls, with comparable levels of placental adiponectin, visfatin, and omentin expressions, plasma insulin, and indices of insulin sensitivity and insulin resistance. Serum visfatin was negatively correlated with neonatal weight and length in the GDM group (p < 0.05 all). Serum omentin was negatively correlated with pre-pregnancy body mass index and waist circumference only in the NP group (p < 0.05 all). Serum adiponectin was negatively correlated with maternal age and HOMA-IR in the NP group (p < 0.05 all) and with placental weight and serum omentin in the GDM group (p < 0.05 all). Conclusions In conclusion, in GDMA1, increased serum visfatin, which has insulin-mimetic effect, might be associated with a compensatory mechanism that improves the impaired insulin function. Decreased serum omentin in GDMA1, which is normally found in visceral obesity, might lead to insulin resistance and contribute to the pathophysiology of GDM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children born small for gestational age are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes in adulthood. The satiety signal leptin that regulates food intake and energy expenditure might be a possible molecular link, as umbilical cord leptin levels are positively correlated with birth weight. In the present study, we examined whether common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the leptin (LEP; 19G>A) gene and its receptor (LEPR; Q223R and K109R) are associated with birth weight and adult metabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes in twins., DESIGN: SNPs were genotyped in 396 monozygotic and 232 dizygotic twins (286 men and 342 women, mean age 25 years) recruited from the East Flanders Prospective Twin Survey. Data were analysed using linear mixed models., RESULTS: The LEPR K109R SNP was associated with birth weight (KK, KR and RR (95% confidence interval, CI): 2511 (2465-2557), 2575 (2516-2635) and 2726 (2606-2845) gram; P(additive)=0.001). Also the LEPR Q223R SNP showed a significant association with weight at birth (QQ, QR and RR (95% CI): 2492 (2431-2554), 2545 (2495-2595) and 2655 (2571-2740) gram; P(additive)=0.003). Furthermore, an interaction between the LEPR K109R and the Q223R SNP on birth weight was observed (P=0.014). G allele carriers of the LEP 19G>A SNP had higher high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels compared to 19A homozygotes (GX vs AA (95% CI): 1.62 (1.58-1.66) vs 1.49 (1.40-1.58) mmol l(-1); P(recessive)=0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that leptin may act as a growth-promoting signal during fetal development, and suggests a possible role for the LEPR in explaining the inverse relationship between birth weight and the development of metabolic diseases in adulthood. Additionally, these results suggest that the LEP 19G>A SNP affect HDL cholesterol levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish mean plasma ghrelin levels during fetal life and childhood. Study design Cord blood was obtained at birth from premature (n=29) and full-term newborns (n=124). Fasting blood samples were taken from 224 normal subjects divided according to Tanner stage and sex. Ponderal index or body mass index was determined. Ghrelin; insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I; IGF-II; IGF binding proteins 1, 2, and 3; insulin; glucose; and leptin levels were measured., RESULTS: Ghrelin levels did not differ between preterm and full-term newborns. Ghrelin increased significantly after birth, peaking during the first 2 years of life, then decreasing until the end of puberty. Ghrelin levels correlated negatively with anthropometric variables in full-term newborns and postnatally, but not in preterm newborns. A positive correlation between ghrelin and IGF binding protein 1 was found., CONCLUSIONS: Ghrelin changes significantly throughout development, correlating with anthropometric and metabolic parameters during extrauterine life. The highest levels of ghrelin are found during early postnatal life, when growth hormone begins to exert its effects on growth and important changes in food intake occur, suggesting that this hormone may participate in these processes.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the plasma leptin concentrations in twin pregnancies in relation to chorionicity and discordant fetal growth. We studied 53 twin pregnancies of which 26 had growth discordance of > or =20% and 27 were concordant for growth (discordance of < or =10%). Paired maternal and fetal blood samples were obtained at birth. Plasma leptin concentrations were measured by RIA. In discordant monochorionic pregnancies, fetal plasma leptin concentrations in the intrauterine growth-restricted twins were lower than the co-twins with normal growth (mean difference, 3 ng/mL; 95% CI, 2.2 to 3.3 ng/mL; p < 0.001), whereas no such differences were present between concordant monochorionic twin pairs (mean difference, 0.1 ng/mL; 95% CI, -0.2 to 0.5 ng/mL; NS). Similarly, fetal plasma leptin concentrations in appropriate-for-gestational-age twins were higher than in the intrauterine growth-restricted twins of the discordant dichorionic pregnancies (mean difference, 2.4 ng/mL; 95% CI, 1.8 to 3.1 ng/mL; p < 0.001). No such differences were present between the concordant dichorionic twin pairs (mean difference, 0.2 ng/mL; 95% CI, -0.1 to 0.5 ng/mL; NS). Maternal plasma leptin concentrations were comparable among all four groups and were higher than the fetal levels. Fetal plasma leptin concentrations of the intrauterine growth-restricted twins of discordant monochorionic and dichorionic pregnancies were comparable. There was a positive association between cord plasma leptin concentrations and the birth weight of twin pairs (y = 0.002x - 0.32; r = 0.63; p < 0.001; n = 106). A significant positive association was also found between percent differences in birth weight and fetal delta plasma leptin concentrations of the discordant monochorionic and dichorionic twin pairs (y = 0.057x + 0.93; r = 0.60; p < 0.001, n = 26). In conclusion, irrespective of chorionicity, plasma leptin concentrations in intrauterine growth-restricted twins were 2-fold lower than their co-twins with normal growth. These differences may be attributed to placental factors.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine the plasma leptin concentrations in monochorionic twin fetuses with and without twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). Paired maternal and fetal blood samples were obtained at birth from monochorionic twin pregnancies complicated with (n=12) or without TTTS (n=12). Amniotic fluid samples were also collected from twin pairs at amnioreduction and/or fetal blood sampling in utero. Plasma and amniotic fluid leptin concentrations were measured by radio-immunoassay. Fetal leptin levels in the growth-restricted donor were lower than the recipient twin of the TTTS group (Delta mean 3.7; CI 2.6 to 4.7 ng/ml; P< 0.001). Fetal leptin levels were comparable between non-TTTS twin pairs (Delta mean 0.9; CI 0.1 to 1.4 ng/ml; P=0.10) and recipient twins of TTTS (P=NS). Maternal plasma concentrations of leptin were comparable between the two groups and were higher than the fetal levels. There was a positive association between cord leptin levels and birthweight of twin pairs (y=0.002x-0.37; r=0.58; P< 0.01; n=48). A significant positive relation was also found between delta leptin levels and percentage discordance in birthweight in the TTTS group (y=0.25x-2.21; r=0.82; P< 0.001, n=12). In conclusion, leptin levels in the recipient twins were three times higher than their growth restricted donor twins. However further studies are warranted to elucidate the underlying mechanism.

AB  - ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine how the rat placenta and fetus respond to maternal high-fat (HF) diet during gestation and to identify the possible mechanisms. MethodsPregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were fed with standard chow (13.5% fat) or HF (60% fat) diet during gestation. Placentas were collected on gestation day 21. ResultsHF dams had greater fat mass, higher plasma leptin, lower plasma adiponectin, and impaired glucose tolerance during pregnancy. The placental labyrinth thickness was reduced in both male and female fetuses of HF dams. In HF male placentas, glucose transporter 3 gene expression, system A amino acid transporter (SNAT) 2 gene expression, and SNAT2 protein expression were increased through the activation of the mTORC1 4EBP1 branch. In HF female placentas, gene expression of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and IGF2 receptor was elevated compared to placentas of females fed standard chow. Although male and female placentas responded differently to prenatal HF diet exposure, both male and female fetal weight was not altered by maternal HF diet. ConclusionsPlacenta responds and adapts to maternal metabolic changes by altering placental layer thickness, mTORC1 signaling, expression of nutrient transporters, and growth factors in a sex-specific manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in serum adipokines in preeclampsia remain vague. We investigated the roles of leptin, adiponectin and resistin and their relationships with clinical characteristics in normotensive and preeclamptic patients., METHODS: A case-control study was carried out in a cohort of 74 preeclampsia(PE) and 79 healthy pregnant women. Serum levels of leptin, adiponectin and resistin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: The mean body mass index(BMI), the serum leptin and resistin levels were significantly higher in the PE group than in the control group (p<0.001). The resistin/creatinine ratio was also higher in the PE group than in the control group (p=0.018). No significant difference was observed in the serum adiponectin level between both groups. Serum leptin levels were positively correlated with BMI (r=0.301, p<0.001) and negatively correlated with newborn birth weight (r=-0.435, p<0.001). Serum resistin levels were also negatively correlated with birth weight (r=-0.229, p=0.005) but were unrelated to BMI. Logistic regression showed that BMI>=28 and serum leptin levels were independent factors of PE. Leptin was a potential mediator between BMI and PE (p<0.001), and the mediating effect accounted for 22.54% of the total effect., CONCLUSIONS: Leptin, resistin, and obesity play important roles in the onset of PE. Leptin and resistin may have some impacts on the fetal growth and development. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maternal obesity has been related to adverse neonatal outcomes and fetal programming. Oxidative stress and adipokines are potential biomarkers in such pregnancies; thus, the measurement of these molecules has been considered critical. Therefore, we developed artificial neural network (ANN) models based on maternal weight status and clinical data to predict reliable maternal blood concentrations of these biomarkers at the end of pregnancy. Adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, and resistin), and DNA, lipid and protein oxidative markers (8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine, malondialdehyde and carbonylated proteins, respectively) were assessed in blood of normal weight, overweight and obese women in the third trimester of pregnancy. A Back-propagation algorithm was used to train ANN models with four input variables (age, pre-gestational body mass index (p-BMI), weight status and gestational age). ANN models were able to accurately predict all biomarkers with regression coefficients greater than R-2 = 0.945. P-BMI was the most significant variable for estimating adiponectin and carbonylated proteins concentrations (37%), while gestational age was the most relevant variable to predict resistin and malondialdehyde (34%). Age, gestational age and p-BMI had the same significance for leptin values. Finally, for 8-oxo-2-deoxyguanosine prediction, the most significant variable was age (37%). These models become relevant to improve clinical and nutrition interventions in prenatal care.

AB  - Background. Maternal metabolic changes impact fetal metabolism resulting in a higher risk for developing chronic diseases later in life. The aim of this study was to assess the association between maternal and fetal adipokine and lipid profiles, as well as the influence of maternal weight on this association. Methods. Healthy pregnant women at term who delivered by C-section were enrolled. Maternal and fetal glucose, lipid profile, adiponectin, leptin, and resistin levels were analyzed by obesity and maternal weight gain. Statistics included descriptives, correlations, and mean differences (SPSS v20.0). Results . Adiponectin and resistin concentrations were higher in fetal blood, while leptin was lower (p < 0.05). A significant inverse association between maternal resistin and fetal LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) (r = -0.327; p = 0.022) was observed. A positive correlation was found between maternal and fetal resistin (r = 0.358; p = 0.013). Women with excessive weight gain had higher leptin levels and their fetuses showed higher LDL-C levels (p < 0.05). Conclusions . Maternal resistin showed an inverse association with fetal LDL-C, suggesting that maternal adiposity status may play an active role in the regulation of fetal lipid profile and consequently, in fetal programming. Excessive maternal weight gain during pregnancy may exert an effect over metabolic mediators in both mother and newborn.

AB  - AIM: Adiponectin is an insulin sensitizing protein. Because gestational diabetes mellitus is associated with insulin resistance, we compared serum adiponectin levels in women with gestational diabetes mellitus and healthy pregnant women., STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-nine women with gestational diabetes and 26 women with impaired glucose tolerance were compared with 27 normal pregnant women in control group. Controls were matched for gestational age, age and body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy with two other groups. At 28 weeks of gestation serum concentration of adiponectin, insulin and insulin resistance (calculated by the homeostasis model assessment) were measured in three groups., MAIN FINDINGS: The serum adiponectin level in gestational diabetes (6379.31 + or - 1934.90 ng/ml), was significantly lower than the impaired glucose tolerance test (7384.61 + or - 1626.70 ng/ml) and control groups (7962.96 + or - 2667.20 ng/ml),(p = 0.02). Serum level of insulin and HOMA index in gestational diabetes were higher than the normal group (p > 0.05). In patients with gestational diabetes, there was a significant correlation between serum adiponectin level and BMI before pregnancy (r = -0.531, p = 0.013). Also, the correlation between maternal serum adiponectin levels and neonatal birth weight was not significant (r = -0.07, p value = 0.73)., CONCLUSION: Our data show that serum adiponectin level was significantly lower in gestational diabetes in comparison with healthy pregnant women.

AB  - Background: Nonessential metals have endocrine disrupting properties, interfere with cellular processes, generate reactive oxygen and deplete antioxidants, while essential metals and vitamins act as antioxidants. The extent to which prenatal metals and vitamins are associated with cord blood hormones involved in maternal and fetal metabolic and growth processes is unknown., Methods: We measured six nonessential (arsenic, barium, cadmium, cesium, lead, mercury) and four essential (magnesium, manganese, selenium, zinc) metals and trace elements, and two vitamins (B12 and folate) in first trimester blood from participants in the longitudinal pre-birth Project Viva cohort, who were recruited between 1999-2002 in eastern Massachusetts. We measured adiponectin, C-peptide, IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3, insulin, and leptin concentrations in cord blood (~n=695). We used covariate-adjusted quantile g-computation for mixtures and linear regression for individual exposures to estimate associations with cord blood peptide hormones., Results: The essential metal mixture (magnesium, manganese, selenium, zinc) was associated with higher IGF-1 (beta=3.20 ng/ml per quartile, 95% CI: 0.39, 6.01), IGF-2 (beta=10.93 ng/ml, 95% CI: 0.08, 21.79), and leptin (beta=1.03 ng/ml, 95% CI: 0.25, 1.80). Magnesium was associated with higher leptin (beta=2.90 ng/ml, 95% CI: 0.89, 4.91), while B12 was associated with lower adiponectin, IGF-2, and leptin, but higher C-peptide. Other individual nonessential metals were associated with cord blood hormones., Conclusions: Our findings suggest that some prenatal metals and vitamins are associated with cord blood hormones, which may influence growth and development.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome is a growing cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Metabolic syndrome is characterized by the presence of a variety of metabolic disturbances including obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and elevated fasting blood sugar. Although the risk for metabolic syndrome has largely been attributed to adult lifestyle factors such as poor nutrition, lack of exercise, and smoking, there is now strong evidence suggesting that predisposition to the development of metabolic syndrome begins in utero. First posited by Hales and Barker in 1992, the "thrifty phenotype" hypothesis proposes that susceptibility to adult chronic diseases can occur in response to exposures in the prenatal and perinatal periods. This hypothesis has been continually supported by epidemiologic studies and studies involving animal models. In this review, we describe the structural, metabolic and epigenetic changes that occur in response to adverse intrauterine environments including prenatal and postnatal diet, maternal obesity, and pregnancy complications. Given the increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome in both the developed and developing worlds, a greater understanding and appreciation for the role of the intrauterine environment in adult chronic disease etiology is imperative.Copyright © 2015 Smith and Ryckman.

AB  - Aim. To study the relationship between obesity of the mother, the body weight of the newborn and the formation of metabolic disturbances in subsequent periods of life. Materials and methods. A prospective study was conducted in which 1,000 women of reproductive age and their newborns were included by the random number method. The mean age is 29.5 [25.0; 33.5] years. The examination included the collection of anamnesis, measurement of body height and body weight, blood pressure, waist circumference and body mass index determination. Micro-and macrosomia in term infants was diagnosed with a birth weight less than 15 and more than 97 percentiles (WHO, 2005). The laboratory study included the determination of glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, high and low density lipoproteins, insulin and C-peptides of basal and stimulated levels, leptin, adiponectin, determination of insulin resistance indices (HOMA-IR) and pancreatic beta-cell function (HOMA-beta). The statistical analysis of the material was carried out using the Statistica 10 software package, SPSS 13.0. Statistically significant differences were taken into account at a level of p < 0.05. Results. It was found that when pregnancy occurs, 41.0% of women are overweight or obese. In the study, the pathological mass of the body in the neonatal period was detected in every fourth newborn (24.8%), including microsomia (11.3%) and macrosomia (13.5%). As a result, differences in the body weight of newborns were found, depending on the maternal pregestational BMI. For example, women with obesity of the first degree were more likely to have children with macrosomia in 33.3% of cases than women with normal body weight, whose incidence of children with macrosomia was detected in 12.0% of cases (OR 6.8; 95% CI 2.66-17.56; p < 0.001). In women in the reproductive period, macrosomia at birth was more characteristic for people with a metabolic syndrome, and was associated with hormone-metabolic changes. Conclusion. The results demonstrate the effect of pre-gestational body weight in women with obesity on the body weight of offspring at birth. Both macrosomia and microsomia at birth can be risk factors for the development of the metabolic syndrome in the long term, which confirms the importance of preventing overweight and obesity in women of childbearing age in the pre-gestational period.

AB  - Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived plasma protein with insulin-sensitizing and antiatherosclerotic properties. The aim of this study was to examine whether adiponectin is present in human fetal blood, to define its association with fetal birth weight, and to evaluate whether dynamic changes in adiponectin levels occur during the early neonatal period. Cord blood adiponectin levels were extremely high (71.0 +/- 21.0 microg/ml; n = 51) compared with serum levels in children and adults and positively correlated with fetal birth weights (r = 0.4; P < 0.01). No significant differences in adiponectin levels were found between female and male neonates. In addition, there was no correlation between cord adiponectin levels and maternal body mass index, cord leptin, or insulin levels. Cord adiponectin levels were significantly higher compared with maternal levels at birth (61.1 +/- 19.0 vs. 17.6 +/- 4.9 microg/ml; P < 0.001; n = 17), and no correlation was found between cord and maternal adiponectin levels. There were no significant differences between adiponectin levels at birth and 4 d postpartum (61.1 +/- 19.0 vs. 63.8 +/- 22.0 microg/ml; n = 17). These findings indicate that adiponectin in cord blood is derived from fetal and not from placental or maternal tissues. The high adiponectin levels in newborns compared with adults may be due to lack of negative feedback on adiponectin production resulting from lack of adipocyte hypertrophy, low percentage of body fat, or a different distribution of fat depots in the newborns.

AB  - It has recently been reported that the ob gene receptor was expressed on human and murine hematopoietic stem cells and that the ob gene product leptin stimulated hemato- and lymphopoiesis at the stem cell level. These findings suggest a role for leptin in hemato- and lymphopoiesis during fetal development. There is at present no evidence, however, that leptin is synthesized and released by the fetus. To investigate this possibility, we have measured plasma leptin concentrations in the cord blood of 78 newborn infants. We found that leptin was present in all 78 infants in concentrations comparable with those found in adults (0.6-55.7 ng/ml). Overall, plasma leptin concentrations in the cord blood of infants correlated with birth weight (r = 0.74, P < 0.001). These observations show that leptin is synthesized and released by fetal fat cells. In addition, they are compatible with the concept that leptin may play a role in human fetal hematopoiesis.

AB  - CONTEXT: We previously demonstrated that low birth weight (BW) infant girls show increased serum anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) concentrations and poststimulated estradiol levels compared to normal-BW infants, suggesting an altered follicular development. However, the impact of high BW on reproductive function is less known., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of BW on AMH, we determined the concentrations of this hormone in low-BW, normal-BW, and high-BW female infants during the first 3 months of life., DESIGN: Twenty-seven low-BW, 29 normal-BW, and 28 high-BW infant girls were studied. We measured serum gonadotropins, steroid hormones, AMH, glucose, insulin, free fatty acids, IGF-I, and adiponectin in a fasting blood sample. In addition, in a subgroup of normal-BW (n = 23) and high-BW infants (n = 10), a GnRH analog leuprolide acetate test was performed., RESULTS: Serum concentrations of AMH were higher in low-BW and high-BW infants compared to normal-BW infants (P = 0.028 and 0.022, respectively). In addition, in high-BW infants, adiponectin concentrations were lower (P = 0.018), and poststimulated FSH and estradiol levels were higher compared to normal-BW infants (P = 0.024 and 0.047, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum AMH and poststimulated estradiol concentrations are increased in low-BW and high-BW female infants, suggesting that these girls may show evidence of an altered follicular development. However, the increased poststimulated FSH levels and low adiponectin concentrations observed in high-BW infants suggest that ovarian function is perturbed through a different mechanism from that in low-BW infants.

AB  - Maternal diabetes-induced fetal programming predisposes offspring to type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity in adulthood. However, lifelong health and disease trajectories depend on several factors and nutrition is one of the main ones. We intend to understand the role of maternal diabetes-induced fetal programming and its association with a high-fat diet during lifelong in the female F1 generation focusing on reproductive outcomes and the possible changes in physiological systems during pregnancy as well as the repercussions on the F2 generation at birth. For this, we composed four groups: F1 female pups from control (OC) or from diabetic dams (OD) and fed with standard (SD) or high-fat diet from weaning to full-term pregnancy. During pregnancy, glucose intolerance and insulin sensitivity were evaluated. In a full-term pregnancy, the maternal blood and liver were collected to evaluate redox status markers. The maternal blood, placental tissue, and fetal blood (pool) were collected to evaluate adiponectin and leptin levels. Maternal reproductive parameters were evaluated as well. Maternal diabetes and high-fat diet consumption, in isolation, were both responsible for increased infertility rates and fasting glucose levels in the F1 generation and fetal growth restriction in the F2 generation. The association of both conditions showed, in addition to those, increased lipoperoxidation in maternal erythrocytes, regardless of the increased endogenous antioxidant enzyme activities, glucose intolerance, decreased number of implantation sites and live fetuses, decreased litter, fetal and placental weight, increased preimplantation losses, and increased fetal leptin serum levels. Thus, our findings show that fetal programming caused by maternal diabetes or lifelong high-fat diet consumption leads to similar repercussions in pregnant rats. In addition, the association of both conditions was responsible for glucose intolerance and oxidative stress in the first generation and increased fetal leptin levels in the second generation. Thus, our findings show both the F1 and F2 generations harmed health after maternal hyperglycemic intrauterine environment and exposure to a high-fat diet from weaning until the end of pregnancy.

AB  - Atherosclerotic CVD is the most common cause of death in the West. Yet, its pathogenesis and early development are only partially understood. Central to the early atherosclerotic process is impairment of vascular endothelial function. Endothelial dysfunction can be measured non-invasively and is evident in children before clinical manifestations of atherosclerosis in adulthood. Factors in early life, such as conventional cardiovascular risk factors, or programming by perinatal growth and nutrition strongly affect endothelial function and hence the development of atherosclerosis and CVD. For instance, low birth weight and faster growth early in infancy have a detrimental effect on vascular structure and function. Childhood obesity, a key independent risk factor for CVD, also adversely affects early vascular health. Obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction and greater arterial stiffness from as early as the first decade of life, while weight loss is beneficial. This effect on vascular function is probably mediated in part by low-grade inflammation and insulin resistance associated with obesity or by the production by adipose tissue of cytokine-like molecules, collectively termed adipokines. A high leptin concentration, in particular, is found in obese individuals and is strongly associated with vascular changes related to early atherosclerosis. The present review focuses on the early origins of endothelial dysfunction, emphasising the role of obesity. It also considers the mechanisms by which obesity impairs endothelial function, understanding of which will be important to further scientific knowledge and to improve public health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine leptin levels in term newborns who were born in the north of Jordan. We also aimed to investigate the relationships of leptin levels with fetal growth parameters, and to assess the difference in leptin levels according to sex and gestational age., METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study that involved 170 term newborns was conducted. A working sheet for data collection was created for each newborn and included sex, weight, length, head circumference, gestational age, and Apgar score. Blood samples were obtained from the umbilical cord vein of newborns after delivery to measure serum leptin levels. Data are shown as frequency, percentages, means, and standard deviations., RESULTS: We found that the mean leptin level was 1.17 +/- 0.48 ng/mL. The independent t-test showed that the mean leptin level in boys (0.93 +/- 0. 34 ng/mL) was significantly lower than that in girls (1.38 +/- 0.47 ng/mL). Pearson's correlations showed that leptin levels of newborns were positively and significantly correlated with weight, length, and head circumference., CONCLUSION: In Jordanian healthy term newborns, leptin levels correlate with sex and intrauterine growth parameters.

AB  - Introduction: Preeclampsia, a hypertensive disease of pregnancy, is globally one of the primary causes of maternal morbidity and mortality. Betatrophin is shown to be a novel adipokine in pathophysiology of metabolic disorders. It plays a role in glucose and lipid metabolism and is associated with diabetes mellitus, obesity and metabolic syndrome. Aim: To analyse the relationship between betatrophin levels and the occurrence/severity of preeclampsia. Materials and Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study was carried out for a sample of 73 women diagnosed with preeclampsia (severe and mild) and 76 healthy pregnant controls matched for betatrophin levels, age, Body Mass Index (BMI), and gestational age. All data were analysed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 17 program (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Distribution of data was evaluated with Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Results were presented as medians (interquartile range) except for normal parameters that are presented as mean +/- SD. The data with normal distribution were analysed with one-way ANOVA test whereas data without normal distribution were evaluated with Kruskal-Wallis test. Correlations between betatrophin and biochemical markers were assessed using Spearman's correlation test. Results were evaluated with 95% confidence intervals and the level of significance was indicated as p<0.05. Results: Betatrophin levels (in ng/mL) were 2.2 +/- 0.6 in severe preeclampsia group, 2.0 +/- 0.5 in mild preeclampsia group, and 1.3 +/- 0.6 in control group. There were significant differences between severe preeclampsia and control groups (p<0.001) and also between mild preeclampsia and control groups (p<0.001). On the other hand, no significant difference was found between severe and mild preeclampsia groups. Furthermore, betatrophin concentrations were found to be significantly positively correlated with both diastolic blood pressure and Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance Index (HOMA-IR) (p<0.001). This is also shown to be associated with the presence of preeclampsia. Conclusion: Betatrophin is believed to be an important predictive biomarker that can be studied for early diagnosis and management of preeclampsia in pregnancies with high risk. More specifically, studies that focus on the evolution of this relationship over the pregnancy weeks could help reduce the maternal and fetal death rates in developing countries. Further randomized trials are needed in order to determine the applicability of this approach in clinical practice.

AB  - Context: Exposure to maternal adiposity during pregnancy is associated with higher offspring birth weight and greater adiposity through childhood and adult life. As birth weight reflects the summation of lean and fat mass, the extent to which fat mass at birth tracks into later life is unknown., Objective: To determine whether fat mass at birth is associated with child and adolescent adiposity., Design, Setting, and Participants: UK birth cohort with markers of neonatal fat mass; cord blood leptin, adiponectin, and birth weight and adiposity outcomes at age 9 (n = 2775) and 17 years (n = 2138)., Main Outcomes: Offspring body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry-determined fat mass, and obesity at age 9 and 17 years., Results: Higher cord blood leptin was associated with higher z scores of fat mass [difference in mean per 10 pg/mL: 0.03 standard deviation (SD); 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.00 to 0.06], waist circumference (0.04 SD; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.07), and BMI (0.04 SD; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.08) at age 9. However, by age 17 the adjusted results were attenuated to the null. Cord blood adiponectin was not associated with measures of adiposity at age 9. At age 17, cord blood adiponectin was positively associated with fat mass (0.02 SD per 10 mug/mL; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.03) and waist circumference (0.04 SD per 10 mug/mL; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.05). Birth weight was positively associated with waist circumference (0.03 SD per 100 g; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.04) and BMI (0.02 SD per 100 g; 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.03), but not fat mass or odds of obesity. Cord blood leptin and adiponectin were not associated with obesity at either age., Conclusions: Increased cord blood leptin and adiponectin, known surrogates of fetal fat mass, were weakly associated with increased fat mass in late childhood and adolescence, respectively.

AB  - CONTEXT: Maternal adiposity in pregnancy is associated with offspring adiposity and metabolic dysfunction postnatally, including greater risk of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Recent genetic analyses suggest a causal effect of greater maternal body mass index on offspring birth weight and ponderal index, but the relative roles of the environment in utero or later in life remains unclear., OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine whether markers of infant adiposity (birth weight, umbilical cord blood leptin, adiponectin, and lipids) were associated with markers of NAFLD in adolescence., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a UK prospective birth cohort with 17 years of follow-up with liver function tests (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyltransferase) (n = 1037 participants), and ultrasound scan assessed liver fat, volume, and sheer velocity at age 17 (n = 541 participants). Missing covariate data were imputed., MAIN OUTCOMES: Ultrasound and biochemical measures of NAFLD were measured., RESULTS: Birth weight, cord blood leptin, and adiponectin were not associated with a diagnosis of NAFLD. In adjusted analyses, 2 of 42 associations attained conventional 5% levels of significance. Birth weight was positively associated with liver volume (1.0% greater per 100 g [95% confidence interval 0.5%-2.0%]). Cord high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol was positively associated with alanine aminotransferase (11.6% higher per 1 mmol/L [95% confidence interval 0.3, 23.4]); however, this association was primarily mediated via offspring adiposity., CONCLUSIONS: In this extensive analysis, we found little evidence measurements of infant fat mass and birth size were related to adolescent markers of NAFLD. The association between birth weight and adolescent liver volume may indicate the contribution of greater organ size to birth weight and tracking of organ size.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to analyze the role of cord blood adiponectin and its multimeric forms in neonatal adiposity and fetal growth velocity (FGV) during the third trimester of pregnancy according to fetal gender., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective analytical observational study conducted at the Diabetes and Pregnancy Unit, University Hospital Joan XXIII, Tarragona, Spain. In all, 96 healthy pregnant women were included in the early third trimester and were followed up until delivery. Maternal blood was obtained upon recruitment, and cord blood was obtained at delivery. Serial fetal ultrasounds were performed during the third trimester to assess FGV. Skinfolds were measured after birth to assess neonatal adiposity. Adiponectin multimers were determined in maternal and cord blood., RESULTS: In female neonates, adiposity and FGV in the late third trimester were correlated positively with cord blood insulin (r = 0.343, P = .015 and r = 0.430, P = .002, respectively) and maternal pregravid body mass index (r = 597, P < .001 and r = 0.428, P = .002, respectively), and negatively with maternal high-molecular-weight (HMW)/total adiponectin ratio (r = -0.269, P = .035 and r = -0.387, P = .005, respectively), but in the stepwise multiple regression model, the main determinants were cord blood insulin, pregravid body mass index, and cord blood HMW adiponectin. Otherwise, in male neonates, adiposity and fetal growth were correlated with cord blood low-molecular-weight adiponectin (r = 0.486, P = .003 and r = 0.394, P = .020, respectively), and it was this multimeric form that emerged as an independent determinant in the stepwise regression model., CONCLUSION: Adiponectin seems to determine fetal growth and adipose tissue accretion, and low molecular weight is more specifically implicated in males, whereas the HMW isoform may be more important in females.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare umbilical cord leptin concentrations in different ethnic groups and between pregnancies with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in Auckland, New Zealand., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 116 European, Polynesian, and South Asian women and their infants with and without GDM. Maternal metabolic measures were recorded at 36 weeks' gestation, umbilical cord samples were collected at birth, and neonatal anthropometric measures were recorded 24 h after delivery., RESULTS: Compared with Europeans and South Asians, samples of Polynesian umbilical cords had higher leptin concentrations (8.7 and 9.5 vs. 14.9 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.026). Umbilical cord samples from pregnancies complicated by GDM had higher leptin concentrations than those from normal pregnancies (22.3 vs. 13.8 ng/ml, respectively; P = 0.022). Maternal leptin concentrations at 36 weeks were similar across ethnic groups and with and without GDM. Cord leptin correlated with birth weight, measures of fetal size, and cord insulin in normal pregnancies and those complicated by GDM. In multivariate analyses, cord leptin was related to birth weight (P < 0.001), gestation at delivery (P = 0.038), and ethnic group (P = 0.017) in normal pregnancies and to birth weight (P < 0.001), gestation at delivery (P < 0.001), and sex (P = 0.003) but not maternal diabetes status (P = 0.909) in pregnancies complicated by GDM., CONCLUSIONS: Offspring of Polynesian women are relatively hyperleptinemic, independent of birth size. Offspring of women with GDM are also relatively hyperleptinemic at birth, but this was associated with their increased birth weight. We speculate that this GDM-associated relative hyperleptinemia may be due to fuel-mediated teratogenesis affecting the adipoinsular axis, which in turn could also lead to leptin resistance and obesity in adult life. The reason for the ethnic difference in hyperleptinemia is unclear.

AB  - BACKGROUD: Air pollution in ambient air could affect the increase of obesity in children., METHOD: Review analyze papers about the effect of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), fine particles (particulate matter < 2.5 mum, PM2.5), and traffic air pollution (NO2, NOx, PM2.5)., RESULTS: Prenatal exposure to concentrations 1.73-3.07 ng/m3 PAHs significantly increased obesity at age 5 and 7 years, up to 11 years. All studies indicate the significance of prenatal exposure with concentration > 0.3 ng/m3 of B[a]P (benzo[a]pyrene). Prenatal exposure to PM2.5 above concentrations 10.6-11.9 mug/m3 increased obesity in children up to the age of 9 years. Traffic air pollution was evaluated according to exposure to NO2 and PM2.5. Concentrations NO2 higher 30 mug/m3 affect adiponectin levels in cord blood, cholesterol metabolism, and therefore increase later the risk of overweight or obesity. PM2.5 9.2-11.6 mug/m3 during pregnancy affect adiponectin. These concentrations from the traffic air pollution can affect the metabolism in newborns later related to obesity., CONCLUSION: All these studies indicate that contemporary concentrations of PAHs, PM2.5 and NO2 in ambient air, especially during prenatal period, affect overweight and obesity in children.

AB  - Low weight in early infancy is a known risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome in adult life. However, little is known either about developmental programming in subjects of normal birthweight or about events between the ages which separate early programming and the occurrence of disease at late adulthood. We tested the hypothesis that circulating concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and insulin in young, healthy adults, born with a birth size within the normal range, are influenced by early life growth patterns. In an observational study of 188 healthy volunteers aged 18-25 years (97 males, 91 females) we investigated the association of metabolic function with their birth size, their growth during childhood and their body composition. High plasma leptin in early adulthood, a risk factor for cardio-metabolic syndrome, was associated with low weight at age 2 years (correlation coefficient controlled for adult weight = -0.21, P < 0.01). It was also positively associated with pre-prandial insulin and with HOMA (Homeostasis Model Assessment) insulin resistance. Leptin, leptin-adiponectin ratio and insulin correlated with lean mass, fat mass and percent fat (P < 0.0001). In conclusion, high leptin in early adulthood was associated with both low weight at age 2 years and insulin resistance. We speculate that high leptin is developmentally programmed and can contribute to the association between low weight in early infancy and increased cardio-metabolic risk in adulthood in healthy subjects.

AB  - It is known that prenatal hyperandrogenization induces alterations since early stages of life, contributing to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome affecting the reproductive axis and the metabolic status, thus promoting others associated disorders, such as dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, liver dysfunction, and even steatosis. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of fetal programming by androgen excess on the hepatic lipid content and metabolic mediators at adult life. Pregnant rats were hyperandrogenized with daily subcutaneous injections of 1 mg of free testosterone from days 16 to 19 of pregnancy. The prenatally hyperandrogenized (PH) female offspring displayed two phenotypes: irregular ovulatory phenotype (PHiov) and anovulatory phenotype (PHanov), with different metabolic and endocrine features. We evaluated the liver lipid content and the main aspect of the balance between fatty acid (FA) synthesis and oxidation. We investigated the status of the peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) alpha and gamma, which act as lipid mediators, and the adipokine chemerin, one marker of liver alterations. We found that prenatal hyperandrogenization altered the liver lipid profile with increased FAs levels in the PHanov phenotype and decreased cholesterol content in the PHiov phenotype. FA metabolism was also disturbed, including decreased mRNA and protein PPARgamma levels and impaired gene expression of the main enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. Moreover, we found low chemerin protein levels in both PH phenotypes. In conclusion, these data suggest that prenatal hyperandrogenization exerts a negative effect on the liver and alters lipid content and metabolic mediators' expression at adult age.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the genetic variants related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and its metabolic complications in girls born small for gestational age (SGA)., DESIGN: Retrospective birth cohort study., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 66 women of reproductive age born at term (37-42 weeks of gestational age) according to the birth weight in relation to gestational age: 26 SGA and 40 AGA (Adequate for gestational age). Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics were measured, as well as the PCOS prevalence. We analyzed 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with PCOS and its comorbidities using TaqMan Low-Density Array (TLDA). miRNet and STRING databases were used to predict target and disease networks., RESULTS: Anthropometric and biochemical characteristics did not differ between the SGA and AGA groups, as well as insulin resistance and PCOS prevalence. Two SNPs were not in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, the rs2910164 (MIR146A C > G) and rs182052 (ADIPOQ G > A). The rs2910164 minor allele frequency (MAF) was increased in SGA (OR, 2.77; 95%; CI, 1.22-6.29), while the rs182052 was increased AGA (OR, 0.34; 95%; CI, 0.13 - 0.88). The alleles related to reduced miRNA-146a (C) and ADIPOQ (A) activity showed increased frequency in SGA. The mature miR-146a targets 319 genes, been the CXCR4, TMEM167A and IF144L common targets and contributes to PCOS. The ADIPOQ main protein interactions were ERP44, PPARGCIA and CDH13., CONCLUSIONS: The miR-146a (rs2910164) and ADIPOQ (rs182052) allelic variants are related to birth weight in SGA and may predict health-related outcomes, such as PCOS and obesity risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare cord blood leptin concentrations between normal pregnancy, pregnancy induced hypertension (PIH), and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study., SETTING: Academic institutes and a tertiary care maternal hospital., METHOD: 48 newborns of normal pregnancies (N=18), pregnancy induced hypertension (N=16), and gestational diabetes mellitus (N=14) were studied. Cord blood samples were collected and newborn anthropometric indices recorded at delivery. Leptin concentrations were measured using an enzyme immunoassay., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin levels were significantly different between the 3 groups (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA; P=0.0064), and the difference resulted mainly from higher levels in GDM than in PIH [geometric mean (95% CI) for GDM: 10.89 (6.30, 18.84) vs PIH: 3.49 (2.14, 5.69) ng/ml (Dunn's multiple comparison: P<0.01). This pattern persisted even when leptin levels were normalized to the ponderal index (Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA P=0.0035; Dunn's multiple comparison: P<0.01). Leptin levels significantly and positively correlated with the ponderal index in normal pregnancy (Spearman r=0.506, p<0.05) and with birth weight in PIH (r=0.5463, p<0.05)., CONCLUSION: In GDM cord blood leptin levels are significantly higher, and a source other than fetal adipocytes appears to contribute to this.

AB  - Background MIRAGE syndrome is a rare multisystem disorder characterized by myelodysplasia, infection, growth restriction, adrenal hypoplasia, genital phenotypes, and enteropathy. The syndrome is associated with mutations in Sterile Alpha Motif Domain Containing 9 (SAMD9) gene, encoding an endosome fusion facilitator protein with additional function in growth factor signaling. To date, there are no reported cases of MIRAGE syndrome associated with severe insulin resistance in infancy. Clinical Case The patient was a premature female infant born at 30 6/7 weeks gestation with a history of IUGR and brain abnormalities. Her hospital course was complicated by respiratory failure, impaired immune function, chronic diarrhea due to pancreatic exocrine deficiency, anemia, and primary adrenal insufficiency. Whole exome sequencing revealed a novel, de novo missense mutation in SAMD9 (R1293Q), confirming the clinical diagnosis of MIRAGE syndrome. At 5 months of age, she developed severe hyperglycemia with insulin resistance (insulin 303 muIU/mL, normal < 13 muIU/mL, and C-peptide 18.2 ng/mL, normal < 2.2 ng/mL). Markers of insulin receptor defects were normal, including adiponectin, IGFBP-1, and SHBG, and no mutations were identified in INSR by whole exome sequencing. The patient had no episodes of diabetic ketosis or metabolic acidosis, and had no lipodystrophy or acanthosis nigricans on exam. Initially, an insulin infusion of 0.1-0.2 U/kg/hr was sufficient to maintain euglycemia. By age 6 months, persistent hyperglycemia led to a rapid increase of the insulin infusion to 18 U/kg/hr over the course of 3 days. On day 2 of insulin up titration, glucophage was started at 15 mg/kg/day. After 72 hours of escalating insulin doses and 48 hours of glucophage, both her hyperglycemia and insulin resistance rapidly improved, with insulin requirements decreasing to < 0.5 U/kg/hr over the next 2 days to maintain glucose in the 100-200 mg/dL range. In the following months, her insulin requirement varied greatly. While fasting, no insulin was needed to maintain euglycemia. However, while on parental nutrition or enteral feeds, insulin infusion requirement varied at 0.03 U/kg/hr - 0.5 U/kg/hr. At 8 months, she transitioned to subcutaneous insulin while enteral feeds were optimized and condensed. Subcutaneous insulin doses were gradually increased to 20-24 U/kg/day in an effort to maintain blood glucose <200 mg/dl. Unfortunately, at 9 months of age, the patient expired from sepsis. Conclusion This is the first case of severe insulin resistance presenting as a manifestation of MIRAGE syndrome due to a missense mutation in SAMD9. This patient had improvement in glycemic control after treatment with glucophage and insulin. SAMD9 mutations should be considered in patients with multiple endocrinopathies including adrenal hypoplasia, severe insulin resistance, and pancreatic exocrine deficiency.

AB  - Children born with IUGR develop features of the metabolic syndrome and exhibit deranged markers of hepatorenal physiology. Metabolic and hepatorenal biochemistry and the rs9939609 FTO polymorphism were investigated in prepubertal children born with IUGR. Ninety-eight prepubertal children (46 IUGR and 52 AGA), subdivided in <5 years and >5 years old groups were included. Anthropometry; creatinine, eGFR, urea, AST, ALT, triglycerides, uric acid, total cholesterol, HDL-c, LDL-c, glucose, C-peptide, insulin and glucagon z-scores; HOMA-IR; leptin and adiponectin concentrations; rs9939609 FTO polymorphism frequency were measured. In males, weight and ALT were higher and adiponectin was lower, in IUGR < 5 years; C-peptide, insulin and leptin were higher in IUGR > 5 years; C-peptide was higher in all IUGR, than the respective AGA. In females, creatinine and triglycerides were higher in IUGR < 5 years old; creatinine was higher and eGFR was lower in all IUGR, than the respective AGA. In males and females, creatinine was higher in all IUGR, than the respective AGA; C-peptide, insulin and HOMA-IR were lower, and AST was higher in IUGR < 5 than in IUGR > 5 years old. FTO rs9939609 frequency did not differ between IUGR and AGA. In conclusion prepubertal males born with IUGR increased weight, insulin and leptin and decreased adiponectin, as compared to males born AGA, emerge as early metabolic syndrome characteristics. The concentrations of these hormones do not differ between prepubertal males and females born with IUGR. Weight control, healthy nutrition and physical exercise should be recommended to these children. The deranged renal (particularly evident in females below the age of 5) and liver biochemistry in prepubertal children born with IUGR suggests that hepatorenal derangements might commence in utero. Regular checkup of biochemical and lipid profile is recommended for all children born with IUGR.

AB  - Adipose tissue secretes dozens of biologically active molecules known as adipokines or adipocytokines. Apelin receptor early endogenous ligand (ELABELA, also known as ELA or APELA) is a circulating signaling protein expressed in placental tissue that binds to apelin receptors. The first animal experimental findings suggested that the ELABELA deficiency might be responsible for the pathogenesis of preeclampsia-like symptoms, i.e., hypertension and proteinuria in mice. Exogenous ELABELA supplementation reverted preeclampsia symptoms and normalized fetal birth weight in mice. Several in vitro studies confirmed that ELABELA supplementation could improve trophoblast cell functions such as invasiveness and proliferation capacity. Thus, the ELABELA axis could serve as the target of innovative therapies for gestational complications. Nonetheless, most human studies do not support the thesis that disturbances in ELABELA secretion in early pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of preeclampsia. Therefore, it is unlikely that ELABELA could serve as a novel early marker of preeclampsia in humans. Alterations in the ELABELA secretion have also been discovered among patients with other gestational complications such as GDM and fetal growth restriction.Copyright © 2022 Rafal Sibiak, published by Sciendo.

AB  - Placental lactogen (PL) is a peptide hormone secreted throughout pregnancy by both animal and human specialized endocrine cells. PL plays an important role in the regulation of insulin secretion in pancreatic beta-cells, stimulating their proliferation and promoting the expression of anti-apoptotic proteins. Cases of pregnancy affected by metabolic conditions, including obesity and diabetes, are related to alterations in the PL secretion pattern. Whereas obesity is most often associated with lower PL serum concentrations, diabetes results in increased PL blood levels. Disruptions in PL secretion are thought to be associated with an increased prevalence of gestational complications, such as placental dysfunction, diabetic retinopathy, and abnormalities in fetal growth. PL is believed to be positively correlated with birth weight. The impaired regulation of PL secretion could contribute to an increased incidence of both growth retardation and fetal macrosomia. Moreover, the dysregulation of PL production during the intrauterine period could affect the metabolic status in adulthood. PL concentration measurement could be useful in the prediction of fetal macrosomia in women with normal oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) results or in evaluating the risk of fetal growth restriction, but its application in standard clinical practice seems to be limited in the era of ultrasonography.Copyright © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The adipokine visfatin has been proposed to exert insulin-mimicking effects and to play a role in the development of metabolic syndrome. Preterm infants are at risk for the later development of insulin resistance and, possibly, for other components of metabolic syndrome. Dietary long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) during the perinatal period may reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome. The authors' objective was to study the circulating concentrations of visfatin in preterm infants and to examine associations of visfatin with anthropometric measurements, metabolic indices, and dietary LCPUFAs. Serum visfatin concentrations were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay at mean (SD) 33.8 (11.7) days of life in 60 healthy preterm infants (gestational age, 32.7 [1.9] weeks) randomly assigned to be fed since birth either a formula containing LCPUFA (arachidonic and docosahexaenoic acid) (+LCPUFA group) or the same formula without LCPUFA (-LCPUFA group). Associations of visfatin with anthropometric parameters, serum glucose, insulin, homeostasis model assessment index of insulin resistance, blood lipids, and adiponectin levels were examined. Serum visfatin levels were significantly higher in the +LCPUFA than in the -LCPUFA group (P < .001) and correlated positively with body weight z score (beta = 0.31, P = .02), total cholesterol (beta = 0.34, P = .01), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (beta = 0.47, P < .001), and adiponectin levels (beta = 0.29, P = .03), but not with indices of insulin sensitivity. In multiple regression analysis, HDL-C and dietary LCPUFAs correlated independently with serum visfatin levels. Circulating visfatin levels in preterm infants are independently associated with HDL-C levels and dietary LCPUFAs. Whether the higher visfatin levels in the +LCPUFA preterm infant group are beneficial for the later health of these infants remains to be determined. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine circulating levels of adiponectin in preterm infants and examine possible associations with anthropometric measurements, weight gain, and leptin and insulin levels., DESIGN: Prospective study., SETTING: A university hospital neonatal care unit., STUDY POPULATION: 62 preterm (mean (SD) gestational age 32.0 (2.1) weeks) and 15 full-term infants (reference group)., INTERVENTIONS: Blood samples taken at discharge (40.9 (14.8) days of life) from the preterm infants and at a comparable postnatal age in full-term infants. All infants were fed the same commercial formula, but in nine preterms the formula contained long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin. Associations of adiponectin levels were tested only in the preterm group., RESULTS: Serum levels of adiponectin were lower in preterm (40.9 (14.8) microg/ml) than full-term infants (53.1 (16.0) microg/ml, p<0.01). However, after adjustment for body weight, the influence of prematurity on adiponectin levels was no longer significant. In preterm infants, adiponectin levels independently correlated with being born small for gestational age (SGA) (beta=-0.35, p=0.01), weight gain (beta=0.28, p=0.03) and LCPUFA-supplemented formula (beta=0.34, p=0.009). Serum adiponectin levels did not correlate with insulin or leptin levels. However, insulin levels were higher in preterm than in full-term infants after adjustment for body weight., CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin levels are lower in preterm infants at discharge than full-term infants probably due to decreased adiposity. The levels are influenced by being born SGA, weight gain and, possibly, by dietary LCPUFAs. The importance of these findings in the development of insulin or leptin resistance in children born prematurely needs to be further studied.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Genetic correlations, causalities and pathways between large-scale complex exposures and ovarian and breast cancers need systematic exploration., METHODS: Mendelian randomisation (MR) and genetic correlation (GC) were used to identify causal biomarkers from 95 cancer-related exposures for risk of breast cancer [BC: oestrogen receptor-positive (ER + BC) and oestrogen receptor-negative (ER - BC) subtypes] and ovarian cancer [OC: high-grade serous (HGSOC), low-grade serous, invasive mucinous (IMOC), endometrioid (EOC) and clear cell (CCOC) subtypes]., RESULTS: Of 31 identified robust risk factors, 16 were new causal biomarkers for BC and OC. Body mass index (BMI), body fat mass (BFM), comparative body size at age 10 (CBS-10), waist circumference (WC) and education attainment were shared risk factors for overall BC and OC. Childhood obesity, BMI, CBS-10, WC, schizophrenia and age at menopause were significantly associated with ER + BC and ER - BC. Omega-6:omega-3 fatty acids, body fat-free mass and basal metabolic rate were positively associated with CCOC and EOC; BFM, linoleic acid, omega-6 fatty acids, CBS-10 and birth weight were significantly associated with IMOC; and body fat percentage, BFM and adiponectin were significantly associated with HGSOC. Both GC and MR identified 13 shared factors. Factors were stratified into five priority levels, and visual causal networks were constructed for future interventions., CONCLUSIONS: With analysis of large-scale exposures for breast and ovarian cancers, causalities, genetic correlations, shared or specific factors, risk factor priority and causal pathways and networks were identified.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal blood leptin levels are positively associated with adiposity. Recent studies suggest that leptin is also abundantly produced by the placenta and may function as a regulator of foetal growth. Our goal was to examine mid-pregnancy levels of leptin in maternal blood in relation to birthweight for gestational age (BW/GA) and timing of delivery after accounting for maternal prepregnancy body mass index (prepreg-BMI) and pregnancy complications., PATIENTS: Data were from 1304 subcohort mother/infant pairs who participated in the Pregnancy Outcomes and Community Health (POUCH) Study (1998-2004)., MEASUREMENTS: Leptin levels, measured at 16-27 weeks' gestation, were log-transformed. Geometric mean (GMean) leptin levels were estimated by weighted linear regression with gestational age at blood draw as a covariate. GMean was re-transformed to the original scale for reporting., RESULTS: Using the GMeans leptin in mothers of term appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates as the referent (25.2 mug/l), we observed lower levels in mothers of preterm-AGA (21.9 mug/l), term small-for-gestational age (SGA) (20.3 mug/l) and preterm-SGA neonates (21.7 mug/l). Results were largely unchanged after adjustment for prepreg-BMI. Leptin levels were higher in mothers who delivered large-for-gestational age (LGA) neonates, both preterm (33.6 mug/l) and term (29.1 mug/l), but the GMeans were markedly attenuated after adjustment for prepreg-BMI., CONCLUSION: The association between BW/GA and maternal leptin levels after adjustment for prepreg-BMI may represent: (i) a residual effect of maternal adiposity that is not fully captured by BMI; and/or (ii) variation in placental leptin levels entering the maternal circulation. In conclusion, mid-pregnancy maternal blood leptin levels may be an early indicator of foetal growth status. Copyright © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Abnormal fetal growth, i.e., intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) or fetal growth restriction (FGR) and fetal overgrowth, is associated with increased perinatal morbidity and mortality and is strongly linked to the development of metabolic and cardiovascular disease in childhood and later in life. Emerging evidence suggests that changes in placental amino acid transport may contribute to abnormal fetal growth. This review is focused on amino acid transport in the human placenta, however, relevant animal models will be discussed to add mechanistic insights. At least 25 distinct amino acid transporters with different characteristics and substrate preferences have been identified in the human placenta. Of these, System A, transporting neutral nonessential amino acids, and System L, mediating the transport of essential amino acids, have been studied in some detail. Importantly, decreased placental Systems A and L transporter activity is strongly associated with IUGR and increased placental activity of these two amino acid transporters has been linked to fetal overgrowth in human pregnancy. An array of factors in the maternal circulation, including insulin, IGF-1, and adiponectin, and placental signaling pathways such as mTOR, have been identified as key regulators of placental Systems A and L. Studies using trophoblast-specific gene targeting in mice have provided compelling evidence that changes in placental Systems A and L are mechanistically linked to altered fetal growth. It is possible that targeting specific placental amino acid transporters or their upstream regulators represents a novel intervention to alleviate the short- and long-term consequences of abnormal fetal growth in the future.

AB  - Adipokines can affect intrauterine development while calf birthweight (CBW) is a breeding standard of calves, which reflects the status of fetal intrauterine development. To explore the correlation between placental adipokines and CBW, 54 healthy Chinese Holstein cows were used in the present study. The cows were grouped according to the CBW of their calves. Placentas were collected immediately after delivery and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction were used to detect the placental expression levels of adiponectin, leptin, visfatin and resistin. Our results show that the mRNA transcription and blood placental content of adiponectin, leptin, visfatin and resistin increased with increasing CBW. The analysis showed that the mRNA transcription levels of placental adiponectin, leptin and resistin were positively correlated with CBW. The mRNA and protein expression levels of adiponectin, leptin and visfatin between the three groups were significantly correlated. Placental resistin mRNA levels correlated positively with adiponectin mRNA, but not leptin or visfatin. The protein expression levels of resistin were significantly positively correlated with those of adiponectin, leptin and visfatin. These results suggest that placental adipokines play important roles in regulating calf intrauterine growth.

AB  - The Intrauterine fetal development process is complicated and affected by many regulating factors such as maternal nutritional status, transcription factors and adipokines. Adipokines are kinds of active substances secreted by adipose tissue, including more than 50 kinds of molecules. To explore the correlation between calf birth weights and adipokines including adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, and IGF-1 in cows venous and venous cord blood. Fifty-four healthy multiparous Chinese Holstein cows were used; in which, cows with a calf weight less than 40 kg were included in group A (n=9); those with a calf weight between 40 kg similar to 45 kg were included in group B (n=25) and >= 45 kg were included in group C (n=20), venous blood and cord venous blood was collected. An ELISA kit was used to evaluate the concentration of adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, and IGF-1, correlations between index-index and index-calf birth weight were analysed. In both cows venous and cord venous blood, adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, and IGF-1 levels were significantly correlated with each other (p<0.01), and levels of these adipokines in venous blood were significantly higher than cord venous blood (p<0.01). Adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, and IGF-1 in venous cord blood were positively correlated with calf birth weights, and significantly correlated with calf birth weights respectively (p<0.01). Our study showed that adiponectin, leptin, and IGF-1 were found in venous blood and cord venous blood, and adiponectin, leptin, and IGF-1 in venous and cord venous blood potentially inter-regulated each other; adiponectin, leptin, and IGF-1 in venous blood were not significantly correlated with calf birth weights, while adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, and IGF-1 in venous cord blood were significantly correlated with calf birth weights, respectively.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of prenatal and postnatal glucocorticoids use on serum leptin and weight gain in sick preterm infants and its correlation with caloric intake., METHODS: Serum leptin was measured in 24 neonates at day 1 (cord), 14 and 28 by radioimmunoassay. Total caloric intake (enteral and parenteral) and weight were measured on days 14 and 28 of life., RESULTS: Mean birth weight and gestational age of study infants were 864 +/- 273 g (mean +/- SD) (range 520-1755 g), and 26.6 +/- 2.4 weeks (23-32 weeks) respectively. Cord blood leptin was greater in infants whose mothers received antenatal steroids (1.98 +/- 1.05 ng/ml vs 0.94 +/- 0.39 ng/ml, p=0.004). Serum leptin increased postnatally from 1.52 +/- 1.0 ng/ml at birth to 2.2 +/- 1.3 ng/ml on day 28 of life (p=0.03). Mean serum leptin had an inverse exponential relationship with postnatal weight gain by day 28 of life (R2=0.56). Total caloric intake on days 14 and 28 of life did not correlate with postnatal weight gain., CONCLUSIONS: Increased serum concentration of leptin following glucocorticoids may be associated with poor weight gain in sick preterm infants.

AB  - Leptin is a 16-kD protein encoded by the ob/ob (obesity) gene. In rodents it plays a role in obesity, diabetes, fertility, and neuroendocrine function. In humans serum concentrations of leptin correlate with total body fat in both adults and children. We measured cord blood leptin in 186 neonates that included 82 appropriate for gestational age (AGA), 47 large for gestational age (LGA), 20 infants of diabetic mothers, 52 preterm infants, and 15 intrauterine growth-retarded (IUGR) infants. There were 16 pairs of twins. The mothers of 17 preterm infants were treated with steroids before delivery. Leptin (mean +/- SD) concentration in term, AGA infants (39.4 +/- 1.1 wk) with birth weight (BW) of 3.2 +/- 0.3 kg, body mass index (BMI) of 12.6 +/- 1.1 was 4.01 +/- 3.5 ng/mL. BW correlated with cord leptin (p = 0.002) in a multivariate analysis controlling for potential confounders. Both LGA infants and infants of diabetic mothers had higher cord leptin concentration 7.3 +/- 3.8 and 6.1 +/- 4.8 ng/mL, respectively, compared with AGA infants (p < 0.05). Preterm infants had a mean leptin level of 1.8 +/- 0.97 ng/mL and a 3-fold elevation was seen if mothers received steroids antenatally (p = 0.006). IUGR infants had increased leptin (6.5 +/- 3.9 ng/mL, p = 0.03). Concerning the twin pairs, the smaller had a higher leptin level compared with larger twin (4.1 +/- 9.51 versus 2.8 +/- 5.14, p = NS). Neonatal cord leptin concentrations correlate well with BW and BMI. No gender differences were found in cord blood leptin. Maternal obesity had no effect on cord leptin, whereas exogenous maternal steroids increased neonatal leptin concentrations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triclosan is a phenolic biocide used in a multitude of consumer products and in health care settings. It is widely detected in the American and Canadian populations and has been shown in animal models to act as an endocrine disrupting agent. However, there has been little examination to date of the effects of triclosan exposure in pregnancy on perinatal metabolic outcomes in human populations., METHODS: Using data from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a Canadian pregnancy cohort, we measured associations of first-trimester urinary triclosan concentrations with total gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes mellitus and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy, and fetal markers of metabolic function. Leptin and adiponectin were measured in plasma from umbilical cord blood samples in term neonates and categorized into low (< 10th percentile), intermediate (10th-90th percentile) and high (> 90th percentile) levels. Triclosan concentrations were grouped into quartiles and associations with study outcomes were examined using logistic regression models with adjustment for maternal age, race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, education and urinary specific gravity. Restricted cubic spline analysis was performed to help assess linearity and shape of any dose-response relationships. All analyses for leptin and adiponectin levels were performed on the entire cohort as well as stratified by fetal sex., RESULTS: Triclosan measures were available for 1795 MIREC participants with a live born singleton birth. Regression analyses showed a non-significant inverse association between triclosan concentrations and leptin levels above the 90th percentile that was restricted to female fetuses (OR for highest quartile of triclosan compared to lowest quartile = 0.4 (95% CI 0.2-1.1), p-value for trend across quartiles = 0.02). Triclosan concentrations in the second quartile were associated with elevated odds of adiponectin below the 10th percentile in male fetuses (OR for Q2 compared to Q1 = 2.5, 95% CI 1.1-5.9, p-value for trend across quartiles = 0.93). No significant linear associations between triclosan concentrations and leptin or adiponectin levels in overall or sex-specific analyses were observed from restricted cubic spline analyses. No significant associations were observed in adjusted analyses between triclosan concentrations and gestational diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance or gestational weight gain., CONCLUSIONS: This study does not support an association between triclosan concentrations in pregnancy and fetal metabolic markers, glucose disorders of pregnancy, or excessive gestational weight gain.

AB  - Background: The heat-stable HSA/CD24 gene encodes a protein that shows high expression levels in adipocyte precursor cells but low levels in terminally differentiated adipocytes. Its high expression in many types of human cancer suggests an association between cancer, diabetes, and obesity, which is currently unclear. In addition, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) is a regulator of adipogenesis that plays a role in insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and adipokine expression in adipocytes. Aim: To assess gender-dependent changes in CD24 KO and its association with PPAR gamma expression. Experimental approach: WT and CD24 KO mice were monitored from birth up to 12 months, and various physiological and molecular characteristics were analysed. Mean body weight and adipose mass were higher in KO mice than in WT mice. Male, but not female, KO mice showed increased insulin sensitivity, glucose uptake, adipocyte size, and PPAR gamma expression than WT mice. In addition, enteric bacterial populations, assessed through high-throughput sequencing of stool 16S rRNA genes, were significantly different between male KO and WT mice. Conclusions: CD24 may negatively regulate PPAR gamma expression in male mice. Furthermore, the association between the CD24 and insulin sensitivity suggests a possible mechanism for diabetes as a cancer risk factor. Finally, CD24 KO male mice may serve as a model of obesity and insulin hyper-sensitivity.

AB  - AIM: We have shown that some markers of oxidative stress were higher in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study examines the relationship between adipokines and oxidative stress and their potential effects in pregnant women., METHODS: Three markers of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, 8-isoprostane and xanthine oxidase) and three adipokines (leptin, adiponectin and resistin) were measured in maternal plasma, cord plasma and placenta of 208 pregnant women., RESULTS: Among all these women, 105 were diagnosed with GDM while the other 103 were controls. Leptin, resistin, malondialdehyde, xanthine oxidase and 8-isoprostane in maternal plasma, cord plasma and placenta were significantly higher while maternal adiponectin significantly lower in women with GDM (P < 0.05). Adipokines in maternal plasma, cord plasma and placenta were positively correlated with markers of oxidative stress. Both markers of oxidative stress and adipokines were correlated inversely with homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance whereas positively with quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (P < 0.01). Adiponectin is negatively correlated with leptin and resistin. Placental/cord leptin and cord resistin levels were higher in the macrosomia while maternal adiponectin level was lower (P < 0.05) than normal birthweight newborns. Both markers of oxidative stress and adipokines in maternal and cord plasma are negatively correlated with newborn birthweight (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Adipokines interact with markers of oxidative stress, both of which lead to insulin resistance, GDM and macrosomia. It has long been known that placenta involves in the development of GDM. Adipokines might participate in this process and need to be confirmed by further studies.

AB  - Maternal protein restriction diminishes placental 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11beta-HSD2) activity and causes fetal growth restriction in mammals. However, it is unknown whether such effect was caused directly by nutrient deficiency, or indirectly through the mediation of maternal hormones. In the present study, a human placental cell line (BeWo) was cultured in F12K as control and F12 as low amino acids (LAA) media for 48 h to investigate the effects of amino acids deficiency on 11beta-HSD2 expression and activity. Despite a significant up-regulation of 11beta-HSD2 mRNA expression in LAA cells, 11beta-HSD2 activity and protein content were decreased by 38 and 54%, respectively (P<0.05), indicating a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation. Among 5 miRNAs targeting 11beta-HSD2, miR-498 was expressed significantly higher in LAA cells. Leptin concentration was significantly lower (P<0.01) in LAA medium. The mRNA expression of both isoforms of leptin receptor was significantly higher in LAA cells, although no difference was detected at protein level. To further clarify whether leptin is involved in mediating the effect of LAA on 11beta-HSD2 activity, leptin was supplemented to LAA medium, whereas three specific inhibitors of leptin signaling pathways, WP1066 for JAK-STAT, PD98059 for MAPK and LY294002 for PI3K, respectively were added to control medium. Leptin restored the diminished 11beta-HSD2 activity in LAA cells, whereas WP1066 (5 nM) and PD98059 (50 nM) significantly decreased 11beta-HSD2 activity in control cells. In conclusion, the present results indicate that LAA diminishes 11beta-HSD2 expression and activity in BeWo cells through leptin-activated JAK-STAT and MAPK pathways.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between adipocyte factors (adiponectin and visfatin) and fetus intrauterine growth., METHODS: Enzyme immunoassay was used to measure the adiponectin and visfatin levels in maternal and umbilical serum from 14 women with fetal growth restriction (FGR group), 14 women with macrosomia (macrosomia group) and 14 normal pregnant women (control group). The correlations of cord serum adiponectin and visfatin with maternal serum adiponectin and visfatin were analyzed., RESULTS: (1) Serum visfatin levels in FGR mothers [(41.4 +/- 5.5)] microg/L were significantly higher than that in control women [(34.7 +/- 4.9) microg/L] and macrosomia mothers [(37.3 +/- 4.4) microg/L; P < 0.01, P < 0.05]. Serum adiponectin levels in macrosomia mothers [(4.1 +/- 1.3) mg/L] were significantly lower than that in control women [(6.6 +/- 1.5) mg/L] and FGR mothers [(6.4 +/- 1.3) mg/L; P < 0.01]. (2) Serum visfatin levels in FGR babies [(58.1 +/- 7.6) microg/L] were significantly increased than that in control newborns [(42.6 +/- 7.8) microg/L] and macrosomia babies [(48.5 +/- 9.1) microg/L; P < 0.01, P < 0.05]. Serum adiponectin levels in macrosomia babies [(6.5 +/- 1.3) mg/L] were significantly decreased than that in control newborns [(7.7 +/- 1.5) mg/L] and FGR babies [(7.7 +/- 1.0) mg/L; P < 0.05, P < 0.05]. (3) Maternal serum visfatin levels were positively correlated with umbilical serum visfatin levels (r = 0.720, P < 0.01). Umbilical serum adiponectin levels were higher than that in maternal serum, but there were no relationship between them (r = 0.301, P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: The changes of visfatin and adiponectin levels may be related to the occurrence of FGR and fetal macrosomia.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Hypertensive disorder in pregnancy is the significant disease that badly affects the maternal and fetal prognosis and lead to higher mortality and morbidity in the prenatal period. Visfatin, potentially a new adipokine has emerged having high contribution in pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. The objective of the study was to find the level of Visfatin in pregnancy induced hypertension and normal pregnant women. Methods: This study was carried out in tertiary care hospitals, Peshawar from March-October 2014. A total of 234 pregnant women (gestational age >20 weeks) were included in the study with distribution as Preeclampsia (PE= 86), Eclampsia (E= 74) and control (N= 74). Blood was taken for measuring Visfatin level by Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique. SPSS version 19 was used for statistical analysis. Student's t test was performed to evaluate the mean differences in patients and control. Results: Serum level of visfatin was significantly higher in pregnancy induced hypertension when compared with control (P value < 0.001). Comparisons of mean value of visfatin with age group of 21-40 years, body mass index (BMI), primary parous and parity 2-4, gestational age of >36 weeks and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure were highly significant in pregnancy induced hypertension when compared with control (p value < 0.001). Conclusion: Pregnancy induced hypertensive women showed increased level of serum Visfatin than normal pregnant women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common respiratory disease of preterm infants. Lower circulatory/intrapulmonary levels of the adipokine, adiponectin (APN), occur in premature and small-for-gestational-age infants and at saccular/alveolar stages of lung development in the newborn rat. However, the role of low intrapulmonary APN during hyperoxia exposure in developing lungs is unknown., METHODS: We test the hypothesis that treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn mice with recombinant APN protein attenuates the BPD phenotype characterized by inflammation, impaired alveolarization, and dysregulated vascularization. We used developmentally appropriate in vitro and in vivo BPD modeling systems as well as human lung tissue., RESULTS: We observed reduced levels of intrapulmonary APN in experimental BPD mice and human BPD lungs. APN-deficient (APN-/-) newborn mice exposed to moderate (60% O2) hyperoxia showed a worse BPD pulmonary phenotype (inflammation, enhanced endothelial dysfunction, impaired pulmonary vasculature, and alveolar simplification) as compared to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment of hyperoxia-exposed newborn WT mice with recombinant APN protein attenuated the BPD phenotype (diminished inflammation, decreased pulmonary vascular injury, and improved pulmonary alveolarization) and improved pulmonary function tests., CONCLUSIONS: Low intrapulmonary APN is associated with disruption of lung development during hyperoxia exposure, while recombinant APN protein attenuates the BPD pulmonary phenotype., IMPACT: Intrapulmonary APN levels were significantly decreased in lungs of experimental BPD mice and human BPD lung tissue at various stages of BPD development. Correlative data from human lung samples with decreased APN levels were associated with increased lung adhesion markers (intercellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, and E-selectin). Decreased APN levels were associated with endothelial dysfunction and moderate BPD phenotype in APN-deficient, as compared to WT, experimental BPD mice. WT experimental BPD mice treated with recombinant APN protein had an improved pulmonary structural and functional phenotype. Exogenous APN may be considered as a potential therapeutic agent to prevent BPD. Copyright © 2021. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine maternal serum leptin concentrations throughout normal pregnancy, as well as cord blood leptin concentration, and to correlate serum and cord blood leptin levels with gestational weight gain and birth weight, respectively., METHODS: This study comprised 52 normal pregnant women, including 11 in the first, 19 in the second, and 22 in the third trimester, in addition to 30 healthy, fertile nonpregnant women of comparable age and with normal body mass index (BMI). Maternal blood and fetal cord blood samples were withdrawn from the normal, healthy pregnant women and the nonpregnant controls for the determination of serum leptin by a specific radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: Maternal serum leptin concentrations in the first trimester did not differ significantly from those of healthy nonpregnant control subjects, whereas leptin concentrations in the second and third trimesters were elevated significantly. There were significant positive correlations between maternal serum leptin concentration and gestational age, gestational weight, and BMI. Cord blood leptin concentration correlated positively with birth weight and third trimester maternal serum leptin., CONCLUSION: Elevated serum leptin is associated with maternal adiposity and risk of developing large for gestational age infants.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity is increasing among the pregnant population. Leptin has an important role in the regulation of energy balance and hunger. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between maternal leptin levels with maternal obesity, gestational weight gain (GWG), single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the leptin gene, and the age-adjusted birth weight of the child., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Maternal leptin levels (n = 740) and SNPs (n = 504) were analyzed in blood samples taken within the Uppsala Biobank of Pregnant women at pregnancy weeks 16-19., RESULTS: Maternal leptin levels differed significantly between body mass index (BMI) groups. Normal weight women had the lowest median leptin levels and levels increased with each BMI group. Leptin SNP genotype was not associated with leptin levels or BMI. There was also no association between maternal leptin levels and age-adjusted birth weight of the child except for a negative association between leptin levels and birth weight in the morbid obese group., DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Maternal BMI was identified as the best positive explanatory factor for maternal leptin levels. Leptin was a strong positive explanatory factor for GWG. Birth weight of children of uncomplicated pregnancies was, however, dependent on maternal height, BMI, GWG, and parity but not leptin levels, except for in morbid obese women where a negative association between maternal leptin levels and birth weight was found. We speculate that this indicates altered placental function, not manifested in pregnancy complication. We conclude that maternal leptin levels do not affect the birth weight of the child more than BMI, GWG, and parity. Copyright © 2019 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: Osteocalcin (OC) is an osteoblast-derived marker of bone turnover that has recently been linked to glucose metabolism, glucocorticoid action, and cardiovascular risk. Objective(s): We determined whether serum total OC (tOC) is associated with cardiometabolic factors, such as insulin sensitivity (IS) markers and endogenous glucocorticoids in 12-year-old children. In addition, we assessed whether low birth weight or exposure to maternal preeclampsia affect tOC concentrations. Method(s): In this cross-sectional study, 192 children (109 girls) were studied at 12 years of age. Seventy of them had been born small (SGA), 78 appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and 44 from preeclamptic pregnancies (PRE) as AGA. Blood pressure was measured, and fasting blood samples were collected for markers of glucose metabolism, osteoblast, adipocyte, and adrenocortical function. IS was estimated by Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI). Free cortisol index (FCI) was calculated as serum cortisol/corticosteroid binding globulin. Result(s): The highest tOC concentrations were detected in midpubertal children (Tanner B/G stage 3). The children in the highest tOC quartile (n = 48) had lower body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio, diastolic blood pressure, leptin, cortisol/cortisone ratio and FCI, and higher insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), IGFBP-3, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) than those in the lower tOC quartiles (p < 0.02 for all). QUICKI was similar in these subgroups. In logistic regression analysis, pubertal developmental stages 2 and 3, high ALP, IGF-I, and low FCI and BMI (p < 0.02 for all) were associated independently with higher tOC. The means of serum tOC and IS markers were similar in the SGA, AGA, and PRE subgroups. Conclusion(s): In both sexes, the highest tOC levels were detected in midpubertal children reflecting the fast pubertal growth phase. Higher tOC levels were associated with lower BMI and FCI, whereas no association was found with IS. Birth weight or exposure to preeclampsia had no effect on tOC concentrations.© Copyright © 2019 Seppa, Tenhola and Voutilainen.

AB  - CONTEXT: Among cytokines, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), adiponectin (Adn), and irisin have been considered potential biomarkers for insulin sensitivity (IS)., OBJECTIVE: We evaluated whether serum FGF21, Adn, and irisin associate with markers of IS and serum lipids in 12-year-old children., DESIGN PARTICIPANTS AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: This cohort study included 192 12-year-old children (109 girls). Seventy-eight of them had been born appropriate for gestational age (AGA), 70 small for gestational age (SGA), and 44 from preeclamptic pregnancies (PREs) as AGA. Fasting serum FGF21, Adn, irisin, lipids, inflammatory markers, and IS markers were measured. Quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI) was calculated., RESULTS: The means of serum FGF21, high molecular weight (HMW) Adn, and irisin did not differ between the sexes or between the SGA, AGA, and PRE children. In the whole study population, FGF21 associated positively with irisin and uric acid and negatively with leptin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). HMW Adn associated positively with total Adn, HDL-C, leptin, and SHBG. Apart from FGF21, irisin associated positively with insulin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, gamma-glutamyltransferase, and triglycerides, and negatively with QUICKI, SHBG, and IGF binding protein-1. In multivariate regression analyses, irisin predicted lower IS and HMW Adn predicted higher HDL-C body mass index-independently, whereas FGF21 had no independent contribution to IS or lipid variables., CONCLUSION: In 12-year-old children, serum irisin was associated with markers reflecting reduced IS. HMW Adn predicted HDL-C, whereas FGF21 did not contribute to IS or lipid parameters in multivariate regression analyses.

AB  - CONTEXT: Elevated IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) concentrations are associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk in adults., OBJECTIVE: To determine if serum IL-1Ra and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) levels are associated with markers of reduced insulin sensitivity (IS) and serum lipids in 12-year-old children., DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Of 191 children (n = 109 girls), 78 were categorized as having had birth weight and length appropriate for gestational age (AGA), 69 were small for gestational age, and 44 were AGA and from preeclamptic pregnancies. Serum markers of low-grade inflammation, IS, and lipids were measured. Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) was calculated., RESULTS: Mean serum IL-1Ra levels did not differ between the sexes or among the gestational categories. Children in the highest IL-1Ra tertile had lower QUICKI, IGF-binding protein-1, SHBG, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol values; and higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference to height ratio (WHtR), and serum insulin, hs-CRP, leptin, and triglyceride concentrations than those in the lowest IL-1Ra tertile. Logistic regression analysis showed higher serum hs-CRP and leptin levels, and WHtR were associated with high serum IL-1Ra levels. IL-1Ra concentration could be used to discriminate the children with lowest IS (area under the curve, 0.68; P < 0.001); hs-CRP level could not., CONCLUSION: Children with the highest IL-1Ra levels had lower IS, higher hs-CRP levels and BMI, and a less favorable lipid profile than those with the lowest IL-1Ra levels, suggesting that high IL-1Ra concentrations may be associated with increased CVD risk in 12-year-old children.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Gender-based differences in serum leptin levels have been reported in umbilical cord blood, and leptin has been detectedin human amniotic fluid. In order to understand if leptin may be directly synthesized by human placentae an analysis made up of several steps was performed. First at all RT-PCR analysis from placenta-derived RNA was used to detect human leptin mRNA. The leptin-like immunoradioactivity detected in placentae extracts was identical to human leptin according to the criteria of charge, immunorecognition, SDS-PAGE analysis and blotting, indicating that intact leptin was found and no variants in size, charge or immunoactivity were present in the placentae. Finally an immunohistochemical analysis showed the presence of leptin in the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblast cells but not in the core of villi., IN CONCLUSION: leptin is synthesized as a single molecular variant identical to human recombinant leptin in human placentae at delivery.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pregnant women with an abnormal screening glucose challenge test (GCT) but without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on subsequent oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) are at increased risk of delivering macrosomic and large for gestational age (LGA) neonates. We thus sought to evaluate the maternal constitutional and biochemical factors that determine infant birth weight in this patient population., METHODS: Women with an abnormal GCT were evaluated at the time of their OGTT in late pregnancy. This analysis was restricted to Caucasian women without GDM (N = 86). Maternal demographic and biochemical factors were evaluated in relation to infant birth weight and LGA., RESULTS: After adjustment for length of gestation, birth weight was positively associated with pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.31, p = 0.0063) and negatively correlated with maternal serum levels of the insulin-sensitizing protein adiponectin (r = -0.30, p = 0.0084). On multiple linear regression analysis, pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain in pregnancy were positive independent determinants of infant birth weight, while family history of diabetes emerged as a negative independent correlate. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that pre-pregnancy BMI was a positive predictor of LGA (odds ratio (OR) = 1.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.05-1.49), whereas family history of diabetes was again identified as a negative determinant (OR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.59). In contrast, neither measures of glycemia nor insulin resistance/sensitivity were independently associated with birth weight or LGA., CONCLUSION: In pregnant women with an abnormal GCT but without GDM, pre-gravid maternal obesity predicts increased infant birth weight, whereas family history of diabetes is independently associated with decreased infant size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Omega-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 LCPUFA) supplementation during infancy may reduce adult cardiovascular risk as observed in animals. We assessed the effect of n-3 LCPUFA supplementation in infancy on growth, body composition, and cardiometabolic risk factors at 5 years of age., METHODS: Infants were randomly assigned to a daily supplement of n-3 LCPUFA or olive oil (control) from birth to 6 months (n = 420). Measurements included weight, length, cord blood adipokines at birth and anthropometry, skinfolds, blood pressure, heart rate, fasting blood adipokines, and biochemistry at 5 years., RESULTS: The infants who received n-3 LCPUFA had a smaller waist circumference at 5 years (coefficient: 1.1 cm; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01 to 2.14), which remained significant after adjustments for confounders (coefficient: 0.8 cm; 95% CI: 0.19 to 1.30). Five-year-old boys who received n-3 LCPUFA supplementation as infants had a 21% reduction in insulin concentrations (ratio: 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66 to 0.94) and a 22% reduction in insulin resistance (ratio: 0.78; 95% CI: 0.64 to 0.95) compared with the control group. There were no other differences in growth and cardiometabolic risk factors between the groups for the whole cohort at birth, 2.5, or 5 years., CONCLUSIONS: Supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA in infancy revealed a reduction in waist circumference at 5 years. Boys in the n-3 LCPUFA group showed reduced insulin concentrations and insulin resistance at 5 years, which may have beneficial outcomes for later health. No effects were seen in girls. Longer term follow-up of the cohort is warranted to determine whether these differences are maintained into adolescence. Copyright © 2018 by the American Academy of Pediatrics.

AB  - Adult health is dependent, in part, on maternal nutrition and growth during early life, which may independently affect insulin sensitivity, body composition, and overall energy homeostasis. Since the publication of the "thrifty phenotype hypothesis" by Hales and Barker (Diabetologia 1992;35:595-601), animal experiments have focused on establishing the mechanisms involved, which include changes in fetal cortisol, insulin, and leptin secretion or sensitivity. Intrauterine growth retardation can be induced by either prolonged modest changes in maternal diet or by more severe changes in uterine blood supply near to term. These contrasting challenges result in different amounts of cellular stress in the offspring. In addition, shifts in the transcriptional activity of DNA may produce sustained metabolic adaptations. Within tissues and organs that control metabolic homeostasis (eg, hypothalamus, adipose tissue, stomach, skeletal muscle, and heart), a range of phenotypes can be induced by sustained changes in maternal diet via modulation of genes that control DNA methylation and by histone acetylation, which suggests epigenetic programming. We now need to understand how changes in maternal diet affect DNA and how they are conserved on exposure to oxidative stress. A main challenge will be to establish how the dietary environment interacts with the programmed phenotype to trigger the development of metabolic disease. This may aid in the establishment of nutrigenomic strategies to prevent the metabolic syndrome.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The sequence of prenatal growth restraint and postnatal catch-up growth leads to a thicker intima-media and more pre-peritoneal fat by age 3-6 years., OBJECTIVES: To study whether carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) and pre-peritoneal fat differ already between catch-up small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) controls in late infancy (ages 1 and 2 years) and whether such differences - if any - are accompanied by differences in cardiac morphology and function., METHODS: Longitudinal assessments included body height and weight; fasting glucose, insulin, Insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I), high-molecular-weight adiponectin; body composition (by absorptiometry); cIMT, aortic IMT, pre-peritoneal fat partitioning (by ultrasound); cardiac morphometry and function (by echocardiography) in AGA and SGA infants at birth, at age 1 year (N = 87), and again at age 2 years (N = 68)., RESULTS: Catch-up SGA infants had already a thicker cIMT than AGA controls at ages 1 and 2 years, and more pre-peritoneal fat by age 2 years (all p values between <0.01 and <0.0001); all cardiac and endocrine-metabolic results were similar in AGA and SGA infants at ages 1 and 2 years., CONCLUSIONS: From late infancy onwards, catch-up SGA infants have a thicker cIMT and more pre-peritoneal fat than AGA controls, but their cardiac morphology and function remain reassuringly similar.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infants born small-for-gestational-age (SGA) who develop post-natal weight catch-up are at risk for insulin resistance, central adiposity and cardiovascular disease in later life, even in the absence of overweight., OBJECTIVE: In young (age 3-6 years) non-obese SGA children, we assessed arterial health (as judged by intima-media thickness [IMT]) and abdominal fat distribution (subcutaneous, visceral, preperitoneal and hepatic components by magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] and/or ultrasound [US]) besides a selection of endocrine markers., METHODS: Comparisons of measures in SGA (n = 27) vs. appropriate-for-GA (AGA) children (n = 19) of similar height, weight and body mass index. Longitudinal outcomes (age 3-6 years) were carotid IMT (cIMT); fasting glucose, circulating insulin, IGF-I and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin; abdominal fat partitioning by US. Cross-sectional outcomes (age 6 years) were aortic IMT (aIMT) and abdominal fat partitioning by MRI., RESULTS: At 3 and 6 years, cIMT and IGF-I results were higher and HMW adiponectin lower in SGA than AGA children; at 6 years, SGA subjects had also a thicker aIMT and more pre-peritoneal and hepatic fat, and were less insulin sensitive (all P values between <0.05 and <0.0001). cIMT correlated positively with pre-peritoneal fat, particularly at 6 years. Post-SGA status and weight gain in early childhood (between 3 and 6 years) were independent predictors of cIMT at 6 years, explaining 48 % of its variance., CONCLUSION: SGA children aged 3-6 years were found to have a thicker intima- media and more pre-peritoneal and hepatic fat than AGA children of comparable size.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Prenatal weight partitioning is gender specific, and infants born small for gestational age (SGA) have a lower fat mass and a lower fat-free mass than infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). Follistatin is an adipokine with adipogenic properties., OBJECTIVES: We examined whether follistatin circulates in the human foetus at term birth and, if so, whether cord blood follistatin relates to birthweight and neonatal body composition., METHODS: The study population was comprised of 248 term newborns (128 girls, 120 boys; 133 AGA, 115 SGA). The main outcome measures used for the study were birthweight, follistatin and insulin in umbilical cord serum, and neonatal body composition by absorptiometry., RESULTS: Follistatin was detectable in all cord serum samples. Cord follistatin concentrations were similar in girls and boys, being about 25% higher (P < 0.001) in SGA than AGA infants. In SGA infants, higher follistatin concentrations related to lower fat mass., CONCLUSION: [corrected] Follistatin is detectable in the circulation of the human foetus at term birth. The circulating levels of follistatin, an adipogenic adipokine, are higher in SGA than AGA infants, particularly so in SGA infants with a lower fat mass.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Background and objective: Insulin and leptin hormones are important regulators of food intake and energy balance. There is limited information about insulin and leptin hormones in neonates. This preliminary study aimed to investigate the concentrations of insulin and leptin in umbilical cord plasma and neonate's saliva and their relationships., METHODS: Umbilical cord plasma and salivary samples were obtained from 13 healthy, appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates. Insulin and leptin concentrations in umbilical cord plasma and saliva were measured using the MILLIPLEX MAP R Human Metabolic Hormone Magnetic Bead Panel., RESULTS: Insulin concentrations in umbilical cord plasma correlates positively and significantly with leptin concentrations in umbilical cord plasma (r = 0.55, p = 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: More research is needed to explore the relationships between insulin and leptin hormones in neonate's saliva.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin is an adipokine that regulates energy homeostasis. The objective of this study was to establish a gestational age-specific standard for amniotic fluid leptin (AFL) levels and examine the relationship between AFL, maternal overweight and fetal growth restriction., STUDY DESIGN: Amniotic fluid was obtained at mid-gestation from singleton gravidas, and leptin was quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Amniotic fluid samples from 321 term pregnancies were analyzed. Clinical data, including fetal ultrasound measurements and maternal and infant characteristics, were available for a subset of patients (n=45)., RESULTS: The median interquartile range AFL level was significantly higher at 14 weeks' gestation (2133 pg ml(-1) (1703 to 4347)) than after 33 weeks' gestation (519 pg ml(-1) (380 to 761), P trend<0.0001), an average difference of 102 pg ml(-1) per week. AFL levels were positively correlated with maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) (r=0.36, P=0.03) adjusting for gestational age at measurement, but were not associated with fetal growth., CONCLUSIONS: AFL levels are higher at mid-gestation than at late gestation, and are associated with maternal pre-pregnancy BMI.

AB  - Child mental health disorders are the leading cause of disability in children and adolescents worldwide. Biological correlates predict psychosocial outcomes throughout human development; however, less is known about metabolic proteins. Drawing from a longitudinal birth cohort study, Born in Bradford (BiB), we examined the role of infant metabolic proteins at birth in predicting early childhood mental health symptoms at 3 and 5 years. We found that higher leptin predicted more prosocial behavior at age 3. Additionally, a higher leptin-to-adiponectin ratio predicted increased total symptom difficulties. At age 5, we found that higher adiponectin predicted a decreased likelihood of being rated by teachers as meeting or exceeding expectations in the domain of "managing feelings and behaviors" and marginally predicted lower competency in "making relationships" on national developmental milestone evaluations. To our knowledge, this is among the first few studies to prospectively predict mental health symptoms from cord blood metabolic proteins, and the first examining this association with a leptin-to-adiponectin ratio. Our results provide support for the possibility that metabolic proteins at birth forecast risk for mental health symptoms in early childhood. Copyright © 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

AB  - Childhood obesity can be predicted by metabolic signaling at birth. Understanding what exposure factors, such as prenatal mental health, predict metabolic signaling at birth are important for understanding the etiology of childhood metabolic dysregulation. Drawing on data from the Born in Bradford (BiB) multi-ethnic birth cohort in the United Kingdom (N = 2962 dyads), this study examined associations between maternal prenatal mental health symptoms and infant leptin and adiponectin. We tested whether total maternal prenatal symptoms as well as specific symptom subscales forecasted infant cord blood levels of leptin and adiponectin. We found that higher total maternal mental health symptoms and somatic symptoms, specifically, predicted lower infant cord blood leptin. We did not find evidence that maternal prenatal mental health symptoms predicted adiponectin. Together, our findings suggest that maternal mental health symptoms may become biologically embedded through infant metabolic changes via leptin. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether umbilical and maternal leptin levels correlate with birthweight, placental weight, and maternal weight; and to detect membrane-bound leptin receptors in placental tissue as well as soluble leptin receptors in umbilical and maternal blood., DESIGN: Prospective observational study., SETTING: University teaching hospital., METHODS: Serum levels of leptin and soluble leptin receptors were analysed in 31 randomly selected mother/newborn pairs at delivery. In addition, placental tissue was assayed for leptin receptors using immunocytochemistry and Western blot., RESULTS: The mean [SD] leptin level in umbilical cord venous blood (7.1 ng/mL [4.0]) was significantly lower (P<0.001) than in maternal blood (22.5 ng/mL [10.8]). Umbilical cord leptin concentrations correlated significantly with birthweight (P<0.001), placental weight (P<0.005) but not with maternal leptin. Maternal leptin concentrations correlated only with maternal weight (P<0.001). In chorionic villous tissue, trophoblasts stained strongly positive for leptin receptor-like immunoreactivity. Two membrane-bound isoforms of the leptin receptor were also detected in placental tissue. In both umbilical and maternal serum, a soluble leptin receptor was found migrating as broad band at Mr 97,000 D., CONCLUSION: The present data strongly reinforce the idea that circulating leptin levels may provide a growth-promoting signal for fetal development during late pregnancy. While membrane-bound leptin receptors may be involved in autocrine regulation of placental leptin production, the soluble receptor form may serve as a transport vehicle for leptin to fetal tissues.

AB  - Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with increased risk of the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). The appetite-regulating hormone leptin is released from mature adipocytes, and its production may be decreased in immature preadipocytes from LBW individuals. We recruited 14 men born with LBW and 13 controls born with normal birth weight (NBW). Biopsy samples were obtained from subcutaneous abdominal fat depots, and preadipocytes were isolated and cultured. Gene expression of leptin and selected differentiation markers were analyzed during preadipocyte differentiation, and cell culture media were collected to analyze leptin secretion. DNA methylation of CpG sites in the leptin promoter was measured using pyrosequencing. We found that differentiating preadipocytes from LBW individuals showed reduced leptin gene expression and a corresponding reduced leptin release compared with NBW individuals. Mean DNA methylation of the proximal LEP promoter was increased in LBW compared with NBW individuals. The notion of impaired adipocyte maturation in LBW individuals was supported by a lower mRNA expression of the differentiation markers; fatty acid binding protein 4, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, and GLUT4. Our findings are consistent with impaired preadipocyte maturation, contributing to an increased risk of the development of T2D in LBW subjects.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Leptin, the ob gene product, plays a key role in the regulation of body fat mass and weight in adult life. The mechanisms by which maternal and fetal/neonatal weight are regulated during human pregnancy and in early postnatal life are poorly understood. High leptin levels are observed in women during gestation and in cord blood at term. We have hypothesized that high leptin levels at term could represent an important feed-back indicator of nutrient supply. Subsequently, leptin could signal adipose tissue status during late gestation and during early neonatal life., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 51 healthy newborns were studied. Clinical and auxological data (birth length, weight, and iliac, subscapular, biceps and triceps skinfold thickness) were recorded using a standardized data sheet. Venous cord blood was obtained immediately after birth in all neonates. Subsequently, capillary blood was obtained from the heel from some of the newborns when blood had to be obtained because of signs or symptoms of particular problems such as hypoglycaemia or hyperbilirubinaemia, at the following time points: two to four hours after birth in 51 infants, 56-79 h after birth in 47 infants and 99-128 h after birth in 23 of the newborns. The ratio between the sexes (girls/boys) was similar at all time points. The infants that were included in the study were subsequently found to be normal and healthy after analysis of the clinical and biochemical data. A specific ultrasensitive radioimmunoassay was used to measure leptin, while growth hormone and insulin were measured using commercially available immunoassays., RESULTS: Gestational age was 38-42 weeks, maternal age was 21-42 years. Birth weights ranged from 2480 to 4400 g. All newborns and mothers were subsequently found to be healthy. Leptin levels in venous cord blood was 0.16-6.80 microg/l, median 3. 47 microg/l and in capillary blood shortly after birth 0.26-7.03 microg/l, median 3.89 microg/l. 56-79 h after birth leptin levels had fallen dramatically, range 0.02-1.69 microg/l, median 0.26 microg/l, while 99-128 h after birth, leptin concentrations in capillary blood (0.05-2.61 microg/l, median 0.59 microg/l) had significantly increased when compared to the levels at 56-79 h (P < 0.001). There was a significant correlation between leptin levels in umbilical vein and birth weight of the neonates (r = 0.57, P < 0.03). Multistep regression analysis revealed that weight and skinfold thickness accounted for approximately 35-70% of the variation of leptin levels. Insulin and growth hormone, and glucose and bilirubin however, had no major impact on leptin levels., CONCLUSION: High leptin levels are present in cord blood at birth and in capillary blood shortly after birth. Since leptin levels in cord blood correlate with birth weight it is tempting to speculate that in the fetus as in later life leptin is signalling expansion of fat stores. Most importantly, we now report that leptin levels are high in the fetus but decline rapidly and dramatically after birth in healthy neonates. This may be important for the stimulation of feeding behaviour and the acquisition of energy homeostasis in the neonate.

AB  - Leptin is an important regulator of body fat mass and energy expenditure during adult life. The mechanisms by which maternal and fetal weight are regulated during pregnancy are poorly understood. In order to gain more insight into a potential role of leptin during gestation, a prospective, longitudinal study was carried out to measure leptin concentrations in maternal serum of 29 healthy women during pregnancy up to 6 weeks after birth and also in umbilical cord blood of their newborns. Leptin concentrations were measured using a specific RIA. In addition, estradiol, testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin were determined using commercially available RIAs. The mothers' skinfolds were determined at four sites using a Holtain caliper. Leptin levels increased continuously during pregnancy and reached 25.8 +/- 14.7 ng/ml at 38-40 weeks. At birth, leptin concentrations were 23.5 +/- 15.4 ng/ml. Three days after delivery a significant decrease of leptin levels to 10.6 +/- 6.0 ng/ml was observed. Six weeks after birth the leptin concentration in maternal serum was 13.8 +/- 8.6 ng/ml. At birth, maternal serum levels were significantly higher than levels in cord blood and did not correlate with leptin levels in cord blood or neonatal weight. Furthermore, leptin levels did not correlate with maternal sex steroids and sex hormone binding globulin levels. At 6-8 weeks of pregnancy, maternal leptin serum levels correlated significantly with BMI (r = 0.81). The correlation coefficients (leptin vs. BMI) dropped with increasing gestational age and at birth only a poor correlation persisted (r = 0.50). Six weeks after birth there was again a high correlation between leptin levels in maternal serum and BMI (r = 0.76). Subscapular skinfold thickness was correlated to leptin concentrations in maternal serum during the whole period of the investigation. In conclusion, maternal leptin levels continuously increased from 6-8 weeks up to 38-40 weeks of pregnancy. Maternal leptin levels decreased dramatically after birth. Six weeks after delivery, leptin levels were comparable to the values measured at the beginning of pregnancy. We hypothesize that leptin might play an important role during pregnancy and fetal development.

AB  - The mechanisms by which maternal and fetal weight are regulated during pregnancy are poorly understood. The ob protein, termed leptin, is produced by adipocytes. It is involved in the regulation of body weight by suppressing appetite and stimulating energy expenditure both in humans and rodents. In this study we examined whether leptin concentrations in the mother and the newborn correlate with birth weight, placental weight, and maternal weight at term. Leptin concentrations were measured in amniotic fluid, venous and arterial cord blood, and maternal serum at birth (n = 27) using a specific RIA employing human recombinant leptin for tracer and standard preparation. Gestational age was 38-42 weeks, maternal age was 21-42 yr, mean maternal weight at birth was 80.0 +/- 10.8 kg, and mean body mass index before pregnancy was 23.4 +/- 2.8 kg/m2. The newborns' mean weight was 3450 +/- 580 g, and mean placental weight was 616 +/- 120 g. Serum leptin levels from nonpregnant women ranged between 1.7-18.4 ng/mL, median 5.5 ng/ml (n = 30). Mean leptin concentration in maternal serum at birth was 20.0 +/- 13.2 ng/mL and was higher (P < 0.002) than in arterial cord blood (9.7 +/- 9.4 ng/mL) and venous cord blood (8.9 +/- 8.6 ng/mL). Mean amniotic fluid leptin concentration was 3.6 +/- 2.8 ng/mL. Placental weight correlated inversely with leptin levels in maternal serum at birth (r = -0.49, P < 0.01). In addition, leptin concentrations in venous cord blood correlated significantly with the levels in arterial cord blood (r = 0.98, P < 0.0001), and leptin levels in cord blood correlated positively with birth weight (r = 0.57, P = 0.03) and placental weight (r = 0.50, P < 0.01). In contrast, there was no correlation between maternal serum leptin levels and birth weight. Thus, leptin levels are high in the fetus and in the mother at term. We hypothesize that high leptin levels could represent an important feed-back modulator of substrate supply and subsequently for adipose tissue status during late gestation.

AB  - CONTEXT: The fetal period has a critical and long-lasting impact on the regulation of metabolic processes and a life-long predisposition for obesity and metabolic syndrome. The exact mechanisms are unknown, but epigenetic regulation likely plays a major role. Twins represent an excellent model to study these mechanisms, as they share the same intrauterine environment and similar or even the same genetic information. We examined cord blood levels of adipocyte fatty-acid binding protein 4 (A-FABP or FABP4), a novel adipokine correlated with obesity and metabolic disease in children and adults., OBJECTIVE: To examine A-FABP levels in the cord blood of twins with concordant and discordant growth and in singletons with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)., DESIGN: Cohort study of 36 twin pairs (25 growth concordant and 11 growth discordant), and 42 singleton pregnancies (28 IUGR and 13 normally grown controls, 1 HELLP)., OUTCOME MEASURES: Cord blood A-FABP levels measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., RESULTS: A-FABP levels were higher in the smaller of growth discordant dichorionic (DC) twins versus their co-twins (109.46 +/- 62.80 ng/mL vs. 72.93 +/- 36.66 ng/mL, P = 0.028). A-FABP was negatively correlated with birth weight and gestational age (P < 0.001), but not with birth weight z-score (P = 0.37)., CONCLUSIONS: Increased A-FABP levels might be associated with an increased metabolic risk in growth-restricted (twins) and prematurely born infants.

AB  - Severely growth-discordant monochorionic (MC) twins offer a unique opportunity to study fetal and placental growth based on a similar genetic background and maternal host environment where the healthy twin serves as an ideal control. Differences in development of MC twins may therefore be due to differential epigenetic regulation of genes involved in placental development and function. Growth-discordant twins are known for abnormal angio-architecture in the placenta of the smaller twin. Since the reasons for this phenotype are mostly unknown this study was aimed to investigate the expression and regulation of genes known to be involved in angiogenesis. We studied 10 severely growth-discordant MC twin placentas (birthweight difference >=20%) without twin-twin-transfusion syndrome and 5 growth-concordant MC twin placentas. Growth-discordant twin placentas were phenotyped by histology. Placental mRNA expression of 88 angiogenesis-related genes was measured by PCR array. ELISA assay and immunohistochemistry were used to confirm PCR results. EpiTYPTER for DNA methylation was used to determine if methylation ratios were responsible for differential gene expression. The PCR array analysis showed significant mRNA up-regulation in the placental share of the smaller twin for several genes. These included leptin (24.6-fold, P = 0.017), fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt1, 2.4-fold, P = 0.016) and Endoglin (Eng, 1.86-fold, P = 0.078). None of the other 84 angiogenesis-related genes showed significant differences. ELISA confirmed significantly increased leptin protein expression (49.22 versus 11.03 pg/ml, P = 0.049) in the smaller twin of the discordant growth cohort. Leptin expression in smaller twins' placentas was associated with elevated DNA methylation of the leptin promotor region suggesting the inhibition of binding of a transcriptional activator/inhibitor in that region. We attempted to overcome the limitation of sample size by careful patient selection. We minimized any bias in placental sampling by random sampling from two different sites and by avoiding sampling from areas with grossly visible abnormalities using a standardized sampling protocol. In conclusion, the smaller twin's placenta is characterized by differentially increased gene expressions for Flt1 and Eng mRNA that may be causally associated with the villous pathology driven by abnormal feto-placental angiogenesis. The substantial up-regulation of leptin mRNA may be epigenetically conferred and relevant to the post-natal risk of metabolic syndrome in intrauterine growth restriction offspring with placental pathology. Growth-discordant MC twins offer unique insights into the epigenetic basis of perinatal programming.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Oxidative stress as observed in fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preeclampsia (PE) can be identified by decreased levels of systemic free thiols (FT) and increased levels of plasma ischemia-modified albumin (IMA), which may serve as biomarkers in maternal blood for pregnancy complications. We evaluate the performance of oxidative stress-associated potential biomarkers for FGR and PE, and their relationship with clinical characteristics., METHODS: A prospective clinical pilot study was performed in healthy controls and women with pregnancies complicated by severe FGR with or without PE. Blood samples were taken directly after inclusion and analyzed for FT; IMA; soluble FMS-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1); placenta growth factor (PlGF); and biomarkers like leptin and soluble receptors for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE). Placentas were examined microscopically. Descriptive statistics and receiver operating characteristics statistics were performed., RESULTS: Mothers with both severe FGR and PE had significantly reduced FT levels (p < 0.001) and PlGF levels (p < 0.001), and increased levels of plasma IMA (p < 0.05), sFlt (p < 0.001), leptin (p < 0.05) and sRAGE (p < 0.01) compared to women with FGR only. Systemic FT levels were significantly inversely associated with blood pressure (p < 0.01) and plasma IMA (p < 0.001), leptin (p = 0.01) and sRAGE (p < 0.001). Systemic FT and leptin showed significant discriminative ability to differentiate mothers with both FGR and PE from mothers with uncomplicated pregnancies or pregnancies complicated by FGR only., DISCUSSION: There is a significant discriminative capacity of FT, IMA, leptin and sRAGE that harbor potential as biomarkers of pregnancies complicated by combined FGR and PE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal growth on the basis of knee height occurs in nearly 50% of pregnant teenagers and is associated with greater gestational weight gain and accrual of subcutaneous fat in the mother but lower fetal growth compared with nongrowing teenagers and mature pregnant women., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine whether leptin is a biomarker for continued maternal growth., DESIGN: Leptin concentrations were measured in 162 growing and nongrowing teenage gravidas (aged 5-fold, fetal growth restriction increased >6-fold, and infant birth weight decreased by approximately 200 g. Gravidas who developed pregnancy-induced hypertension showed a different pattern-higher leptin concentrations at entry and week 28, no difference in the leptin surge, and no postpartum difference in leptin concentration., CONCLUSION: A leptin surge by week 28 appears to mark reduced mobilization of maternal fat stores that is associated with maternal growth on the basis of knee height during adolescent pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood adiponectin and leptin concentrations are associated with birth weight and adiposity. Birth size and rate of infant weight gain are associated with future obesity risk. However, it is unclear whether biomarkers reflecting the intrauterine environment are predictive of infant prospective body composition change., OBJECTIVES: To examine whether cord blood adiponectin and leptin are predictive of neonatal adiposity and fat mass (FM) accrual to 3 months of age., METHODS: Participants (n = 36) were healthy African American infants. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured in umbilical cord blood. At 2 weeks and 3 months, infant body composition was assessed via air displacement plethysmography. Weight-for-length z-scores (WLZ) were calculated using World Health Organization standards. Multiple linear regression was used to examine associations of cord blood adiponectin and leptin with birth WLZ; WLZ, FM and fat-free mass at 2 weeks, and the conditional change in these variables from 2 weeks to 3 months (body composition at 3 months adjusted for body composition at 2 weeks)., RESULTS: Adiponectin was positively associated with FM at 2 weeks (r = 0.45, P < 0.01), but inversely associated with conditional FM change from 2 weeks to 3 months of age (r = -0.38, P < 0.05). Leptin was not significantly associated with infant body composition., CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin may be a marker for FM accrual in African American infants, a relatively understudied population with a high long-term obesity risk. Mechanistic studies are needed to determine whether adiponectin directly influences infant growth or is simply a maker reflective of other ongoing biological changes after birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes (GDM) is an increasing and common complication of pregnancy. The involvement of inflammatory mechanisms in GDM remains unclear. YKL-40 is a novel inflammatory marker that has been recently found to be associated with type 2 diabetes. This is the first study to investigate YKL-40 in GDM., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 58 subjects were included, 28 patients with GDM (BMI 33.2 +/- 6.1 kg m(-(2)), 33 +/- 6 years) and 30 healthy pregnant controls (BMI 28.4 +/- 5.2 kg m(-(2)), 33 +/- 4 years; mean +/- SD). Standard risk factors for GDM (weight and BMI prior to pregnancy, family history, former GDM, high birthweight offspring) were evaluated. A 2-h 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) and measurement of YKL-40 were conducted in gestational week 28 +/- 4, as well as 8 weeks after delivery., RESULTS: YKL-40 was not different between GDM and controls, neither during (65.8 +/- 44.4 vs. 60.3 +/- 30.1 ng mL(-1)), nor after pregnancy (63.4 +/- 30.5 vs. 66.9 +/- 32.7 ng mL(-1)). YKL-40 was correlated with insulin, HOMA and BMI. GDM had higher fasting insulin (14.1 +/- 7.4 vs. 8.3 +/- 4.3 muU mL(-1)) and glucose (88 +/- 13 - 200 +/- 31 - 160 +/- 33 vs. 76 +/- 10 - 146 +/- 37 - 112 +/- 28 mg dL(-1) for fasting, 1- and 2-h-concentrations in the oGTT, respectively), higher HbA1c (5.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 5.0 +/- 0.5%;), HOMA (3.1 +/- 1.7 vs. 1.6 +/- 0.9), and BMI (33.2 +/- 6.1 vs. 28.5 +/- 5.2 kg m(-2)) (means +/- SD, all P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: No difference in YKL-40 between GDM and controls suggests similar inflammatory status at the time of measurements. The short duration of metabolic changes during GDM might explain this finding, which is in contrast to results in type 2 diabetes.

AB  - PURPOSE: In our study, we investigated the influence of plasma levels ghrelin, leptin and other metabolic hormones (ILGF-1 and ILGF-2) in pregnants in regulating fetal body weight and mode of delivery., METHODS: A total of 36 appropriately healthy pregnants 19-36-year-old were involved in the study. Demographic characteristics, serum ghrelin, leptin, IGF-1 and IGF-2 levels of the pregnants were studied., RESULTS: Plasma ghrelin and leptin levels did not differ significantly among trimesters and delivery, in contrast to IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations were significantly higher in the first half of the pregnancy (P < 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly associated with mode of delivery (r = 0.231; P = 0.008), BMI (r = 0.462; P = 0.004)., CONCLUSION: Metabolic factors are associated with fetal growth, but in AGA babies, there were no differences between any parameter and clinical factor.

AB  - Adiponectin and leptin, two adipose-tissue-derived proteins, have been reported to be elevated in women with established PE (pre-eclampsia). The aim of the present study was to investigate whether alterations in adiponectin and leptin levels predate the development of PE and FGR (fetal growth restriction) in women at increased risk of these complications, as assessed by Doppler examination of the uterine arteries during the second trimester of pregnancy. We also sought to investigate the circulating levels of adiponectin and leptin in women with established severe early-onset FGR. The study included three groups of pregnant women at 23-25 weeks: Group A (n=44) with normal uterine artery Doppler waveforms, Group B (n=49) with abnormal Doppler waveforms and normal fetal growth at the time of the examination, and Group C (n=15) with established severe FGR and abnormal Doppler waveforms. All women had plasma adiponectin and leptin measured by sensitive immunoassays. In Group B, 19 women had a normal outcome, 17 delivered infants with FGR and 13 developed PE. The women who developed PE delivered smaller babies earlier than women with a normal outcome (P<0.001). There were no significant differences in adiponectin levels between any of the groups (overall P=0.3). Leptin concentrations, expressed as MoM (multiples of the median) of Group A, were higher in women in Group C, i.e. established severe FGR at 2.5 (1.2-2.7) MoMs (overall P<0.001), compared with all of the other groups and subgroups. In conclusion, we found that, in pregnancies complicated by severe early-onset FGR, the maternal plasma concentration of leptin is twice as high as in normal pregnancies. However, the second trimester levels of maternal plasma adiponectin and leptin in pregnancies that subsequently develop PE and/or FGR are not significantly different from normal and, consequently, it is unlikely that these markers will be useful as predictors of these pregnancy complications.

AB  - Studies have shown that the early life environment affects feeding behaviour, food intake and energy balance in later life, suggesting there is a link between foetal and infant growth and the risk of metabolic disorders in adulthood. Although there is an evident epidemiological association between low birth weight and adult-onset diseases, the incidence of metabolic diseases in adulthood among people who were born prematurely is still unknown. Considerable advances have been made during the last years in the scientific knowledge of the benefits of early nutrition, such as breastfeeding, on health and well-being later in life. Nutritional researchers have focussed their attention on the biological characteristics of human breast milk, which represents the main source of nutrients in the first months of life for breastfed infants. Recently, leptin and ghrelin have been detected in the breast milk of mothers of term and preterm infants. Adiponectin and resistin, present in term human milk, have not been investigated in the breast milk of mothers of preterm infants. These hormones are involved in the regulation of energy balance and may have a role in the regulation of growth and development in the neonatal period and infancy, as well as long-term effects on metabolic programming. Leptin, adiponectin and resistin have been found at lower levels in pre-term infants compared with term newborns, whereas there seems to be no difference in ghrelin levels. Future research is necessary to clarify the role of hormones present in breast milk for identifying potential short- and long-term effects of breastfeeding on the health of children born prematurely.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiological basis of glioma is poorly understood. We have used genetic markers in a Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to examine if lifestyle, cardiometabolic, and inflammatory factors influence the risk of glioma. This methodology reduces bias from confounding and is not affected by reverse causation., METHODS: We identified genetic instruments for 37 potentially modifiable risk factors and evaluated their association with glioma risk using data from a genome-wide association study of 12 488 glioma patients and 18 169 controls. We used the estimated odds ratio of glioma associated with each of the genetically defined traits to infer evidence for a causal relationship with the following exposures:Lifestyle and dietary factors-height, plasma insulin-like growth factor 1, blood carnitine, blood methionine, blood selenium, blood zinc, circulating adiponectin, circulating carotenoids, iron status, serum calcium, vitamins (A1, B12, B6, E, and 25-hydroxyvitamin D), fatty acid levels (monounsaturated, omega-3, and omega-6) and circulating fetuin-A;Cardiometabolic factors-birth weight, high density lipoprotein cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, total triglycerides, basal metabolic rate, body fat percentage, body mass index, fasting glucose, fasting proinsulin, glycated hemoglobin levels, diastolic and systolic blood pressure, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio; andInflammatory factors- C-reactive protein, plasma interleukin-6 receptor subunit alpha and serum immunoglobulin E., RESULTS: After correction for the testing of multiple potential risk factors and excluding associations driven by one single nucleotide polymorphism, no significant association with glioma risk was observed (ie, PCorrected > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study did not provide evidence supporting any of the 37 factors examined as having a significant influence on glioma risk.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Maternal obesity increases the risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and is positively correlated with neonatal obesity increasing the risk of adiposity in both young and adult offspring. Maternal secreted factors from adipose tissue such as adipokines and inflammatory cytokines may regulate fetal growth. This study investigated associations between maternal adipokines and inflammatory markers at late gestation, and neonatal anthropometric characteristics in mothers with and without GDM., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 65 women with GDM and 65 pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance evaluated at the time of term elective Caesarean section. Adiponectin, leptin, resistin, adipsin, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), nerve growth factor (NGF), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) concentrations were measured in maternal serum by the multiplex immunoassay using Magpix technology. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured with a particle-enhanced turbidimetric immunoassay and neonatal anthropometric variables were assessed. The association of birthweight with individual biomarkers was analyzed using multivariate logistic regression adjusted for maternal factors., RESULTS: Adiponectin, leptin, resistin, adipsin, NGAL and NGF were not significantly associated with higher birthweight. The maternal factors in association with higher birthweight observed in GDM were CRP, MCP-1 and TNF-alpha levels. Regression analysis showed that TNF-alpha was an independent risk factor for higher birthweight (p = 0.046)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest an involvement of maternal inflammatory markers at late gestation and fetal growth in mothers with GDM, and that TNF-alpha could play a major role.

AB  - Fetal environment is known to be a major predictive factor of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, associations of fetal environment and cord blood glycoforms are uncertain. In this study, we aimed to determine whether glycosylation status in neonatal cord blood is associated with perinatal outcomes reflecting a poor fetal environment.Thirty-six low birth weight (LBW) infants and 120 normal birth weight infants were recruited from a longitudinal birth cohort. We conducted a comprehensive cord blood N-glycan analysis using matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Associations of N-glycans with perinatal outcomes, including LBW, small for gestational age, and levels of cord blood leptin and adiponectin, were evaluated using logistic or multiple regression. We also prospectively explored correlations between N-glycans and 6 or 18-month rapid weight gain (>0.67 SD score). A total of 35 N-glycans were detected (m/z value 1362.481-3865.407). Of these, abundance levels of G3414 (m/z value 3414.238) were inversely correlated with LBW and small for gestational age. Abundance levels of G1915 (m/z value 1914.698), G2744 (m/z value 2743.994), G3049 (m/z value 3049.105), and G3719 (m/z value 3719.349) were inversely related to LBW. The total N-glycan abundance levels were strongly positively correlated with levels of leptin and adiponectin in cord blood. In a prospective exploratory analysis, the 5 LBW-related N-glycans (G1915, G2744, G3049, G3414, and G3719) were all inversely associated with 6 or 18-month rapid weight gain. These N-glycans are structurally categorized into 2 different categories: fucosylated bi or tri-antennary N-glycans; and tri or tetra-antennary N-glycans without fucosylation. In conclusion, mass spectrometry-based cord blood glycosylation analysis shows that 5 types of N-glycans are potential predictors of a poor fetal environment.

AB  - Recently, we reported that monosodium glutamate-treated mice (MSG mice) developed severe hyperlipidemia and diabetes mellitus and several complications of obesity. MSG mice acquired fatty livers and subsequently underwent changes that are characteristic of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). In the present study, the effects of bezafibrate on obesity, diabetes mellitus. and NAFLD/NASH were examined in MSG mice. A single dose of MSG (4 mg/g) was administered subcutaneously to neonatal male mice within 24 h of birth. Bezafibrate was mixed into the normal feed for 8 weeks. The weight and body mass index of MSG mice increased significantly despite the unchanged intake of food. Triglyceride and total cholesterol levels in blood, visceral adipose tissue, and interscapular adipose tissue rose significantly. In the livers of MSG mice, moderate centrilobular microvesicular steatosis, ballooning degeneration with Mallory bodies, and scattered infiltration of neutrophils and lymphocytes were observed. Centrilobular hepatocytes were 4-hydroxynonenal-positive in MSG mice. Bezafibrate ameliorated the severity of diabetes mellitus, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperlipidemia. Adiponectin and leptin concentrations in blood improved, and the accumulation of visceral fat was inhibited. The expression of acyl-CoA oxidase, a beta-oxidation gene, and carnitine palmitoyl transferase, which regulates lipid metabolism, increased markedly on administration of bezafibrate. The liver pathology in MSG mice also improved with bezafibrate; specifically, macro- and microvesicles in hepatocytes nearly disappeared, and NAFLD activity score improved. It is concluded that bezafibrate inhibits the accumulation of visceral fat, following amelioration of hyperlipidemia, in MSG-induced obese mice, due to improvements in diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, and NAFLD.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adiponectin has important anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects. Although adiponectin and atherosclerosis correlate inversely in children and adults, we have little information regarding this relationship in neonates., METHODS: We measured cord blood adiponectin levels and abdominal aortic intima media thickness (aIMT) in 80 healthy, term neonates and investigated the relationship between adiponectin and total cholesterol (TC), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride, and their relationships to infant anthropometry and gender., RESULTS: Mean birth weight, length, head circumference and aIMT values for male neonates were statistically significantly higher than those for female neonates. Adiponectin levels were not significantly different with respect to gender. In correlation analysis, the mean adiponectin level correlated positively with TC, HDL-C and LDL-C levels and birth weight, length and head circumference. There was no significant correlation between aIMT and any other parameters., CONCLUSION: The cord blood adiponectin and aIMT values reported here for the first time, represent reference values in the early neonatal period. The positive correlations between adiponectin levels and birth weight, length and head circumference, and TC, HDL-C and LDL-C indicate that further studies are required to demonstrate the exact relationship and clinical importance of adiponectin metabolism during the neonatal period.

AB  - We aimed to study maternal and infant serum leptin concentrations during the perinatal period and their relationship to the body weight of mothers and newborns. Serum leptin values were measured by enzyme-linked immunoadsorbent assay (ELISA) (R&D systems) in 26 healthy, term neonates during the first (N1) and fifth (N5) day after birth and were compared with serum leptin values in maternal blood (MS), amniotic fluid (AF), and umbilical cord (UC) at delivery. Twenty-five healthy, nonpregnant women, age and body weight-matched to the mothers, were used as controls (C). Infant serum leptin concentrations declined significantly after birth from UC to the N5 samples (p<0.003). MS leptin values were significantly higher than UC, N1, N5, and C values (p<0.001), while AF values were significantly lower than in controls (p<0.001). UC, but not MS leptin values correlated significantly with the birth weight of infants (r = 0.6; p<0.03). The elevated values of leptin in maternal serum and the regressing pattern of infant leptin values after birth suggest an additional, probably placental source of this protein during pregnancy, possibly contributing to the regulation of fetal body weight.

AB  - Background: Assessing fetal growth constitutes a fundamental aim within the realm of prenatal care. Impaired prenatal growth increases the risk of perinatal mortality, morbidity, and poor newborn outcomes. Growth restriction increases the risk of premature birth problems, as well as the risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and future non-communicable disorders such as hypertension and metabolic syndrome as adults. The objective of this systematic review is to accumulate current literature evidence to assess the patterns of serum adipokine levels among women with growth-restricted fetuses and assess their potential alterations in those high-risk pregnancies. Methods: Medline, Scopus, CENTRAL, Clinicaltrials.gov, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched from inception until 31 March 2023. All observational studies reporting serum adipokine values among women with appropriately grown and growth-restricted fetuses were held eligible. Results: The current systematic review encompassed a total of 20 studies, incorporating a patient population of 1850 individuals. Maternal blood leptin emerged as the adipokine most investigated, as evidenced by 13 studies encompassing a collective sample size of 1081 patients, all of which explored its potential correlation with intrauterine growth restriction. Elevated levels of leptin were detected in fetuses with intrauterine growth restriction, although the observed difference did not reach statistical significance. Furthermore, regarding adiponectin, the meta-analysis conducted indicated that there were not any statistically significant differences observed in the mean values of adiponectin. The available data on the remaining three adipokines were extremely limited, making it difficult for any solid conclusions to be extracted. Conclusions: Though limited and inconsistent, the existing data suggest that fetal growth restriction is not linked to leptin, adiponectin, visfatin, resistin, or RBP4. More substantial prospective studies are needed to comprehend the importance of established and novel adipokines.

AB  - Health in pregnancy and infancy can affect the risk of chronic non-communicable diseases. We aimed to describe leptin and adiponectin concentrations in low birth weight (LBW) infants and identify possible associations with maternal nutritional status, adequacy for gestational age, nutritional recovery, and current dietary intake. A cross-sectional study with LBW infants (9-12 months) including maternal background and pre-pregnancy nutritional condition was performed. From the Infants: anthropometry at birth and current was expressed as z-score (weight: WAZ, length, head circumference), nutritional recovery, dietary intake, leptin, and adiponectin blood concentrations. The mean age of the 54 infants was 10.0 +/- 1.5 months, 32 (59.3%) were female, 36 (66.7%) preterm, 23 (42.6%) small for gestational age (SGA), and 25 pregnancies (46.3%) were twin. Almost all (98%) of the infants intake energy and protein above the recommendation, and 47 (87.6%) consumed ultra-processed foods. At the time of the assessment, 8 (14.8%) were overweight and 4 (7.4%) had short stature. SGA infants showed faster weight recovery (WAZ 1.54; 95% CI 1.17, 1.91; p = 0.001), higher leptin's concentration (3.0 ng/ml (1.7, 3.0) versus 1.6 ng/ml (0.9, 2.6); p = 0.032)), and leptin/adiponectin ratio (0.13 +/- 0.08 versus 0.07 +/- 0.07; p = 0.018). The pre-gestational BMI was a modifier of the effect of WAZ on leptin levels (p = 0.027) in LBW infants. Higher pre-gestational BMI increased the effect of WAZ variation (birth and current) on leptin levels. Concluding, LBW infants showed early changes in leptin and adiponectin concentrations, influenced by maternal (pre-gestational BMI), intrauterine (gestational age adequacy - SGA), and postnatal weight gain. This combination of factors may increase the risk of NCD for this group of children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This cross-sectional study aimed to evaluate the association between leptin, insulin and adiponectin levels and anthropometric measurements of term newborns of adolescent and adult mothers., STUDY DESIGN: Umbilical cord plasma samples were obtained from 80 healthy term neonates (40 from teenagers and 40 from adult mothers) and adiponectin, insulin and leptin concentrations were measured., RESULTS: Cord plasma adiponectin levels were higher in the boys from adult mothers than in the boys of the adolescent (p < 0.05), while plasma leptin levels in the boys of the adults were significantly lower (p < 0.05) than those of girls from both groups. Univariate correlation analysis showed that leptin umbilical cord plasma levels were positively associated with birth weight in neonates from adolescents and adults. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that leptin levels showed significant positive predictor for birth weight specifically in the adult mother., CONCLUSION: Gestational age, but not adipokines, showed to be a significant positive predictor factor of birth weight in adolescent pregnancy.

AB  - Spexin is a newly described peptide and is known to reduce the uptake of long-chain fatty acids into adipocytes. The serum spexin levels of obese children between the ages of 12-18 are lower. The effect of serum spexin and free 25(OH) vitamin D3 levels on intrauterine development in newborns is unknown. Our aims is to evaluate the effects of spexin and adipocytokin levels in the cord blood of term newborn babies on the weight of the baby according to the gestation age (GA) and anthropometric measurement results. Babies who were born in our hospital and whose GA was >=37 weeks were evaluated in three groups as appropriate for GA (AGA), small for GA (SGA) and large for GA (LGA). A total of 84 babies, including an equal number of infants in AGA, SGA and LGA groups, were included in the study. Spexin, leptin, active ghrelin, free 25(OH) vitamin D3, glucose, and insulin levels in the cord blood of infants were examined at birth. The results were compared according to GA and birth weight (BW). There was no statistically significant difference between groups in terms of mean spexin, active ghrelin, free 25(OH) vitamin D3, and insulin levels. The mean leptin level was significantly higher in LGA group than SGA and AGA groups (p 0.004). The mean spexin and leptin levels were higher in girls than in boys (respectively p value 0.029, 0.003). Although there is a significant positive correlation between BW, head circumference, height, umbilical circumference, umbilical circumference/height ratio and the mean leptin levels (p < 0.001), there was no significant correlation between mean spexin, active ghrelin, free 25 (OH) vitamin D3, insulin, and glucose levels. This study suggests that spexin may not have an effect on intrauterine development. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Fibroblast growth factor 19 (FGF19) and 21 (FGF21) have been linked to obesity and type 2 diabetes in adults. We assessed the circulating concentrations of these factors in human neonates and infants, and their association with the endocrine-metabolic changes associated to prenatal growth restraint., SUBJECTS/METHODS: Circulating FGF19 and FGF21, selected hormones (insulin, insulin-like growth factor I and high- molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin) and body composition (absorptiometry) were assessed longitudinally in 44 infants born appropriate- (AGA) or small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Measurements were performed at 0, 4 and 12 months in AGA infants; at 0 and 4 months in SGA infants; and cross-sectionally in 11 first-week AGA newborns., RESULTS: Circulating FGF19 and FGF21 surged >10-fold in early infancy from infra- to supra-adult concentrations, the FGF19 surge appearing slower and more pronounced than the FGF21 surge. Whereas the FGF21 surge was of similar magnitude in AGA and SGA infants, FGF19 induction was significantly reduced in SGA infants. In AGA and SGA infants, cord-blood FGF21 and serum FGF19 at 4 months showed a positive correlation with HMW adiponectin (r=0.49, P=0.013; r=0.43, P=0.019, respectively)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that these early FGF19 and FGF21 surges are of a physiological relevance that warrants further delineation and that may extend beyond infancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Being small for gestational age (SGA) at birth and postnatal growth pattern may have an impact on insulin resistance and body composition in later life. Adiponectin is a strong determinant of insulin sensitivity., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate insulin resistance and adiponectin levels in SGA born children with catch-up growth (CUG) in the absence of obesity in prepubertal ages and relations with body composition and insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1., METHODS: Twenty-four (15F, 9M) SGA born children with CUG but without obesity were evaluated at age 6.3 +/- 0.5 years with respect to glucose, insulin, IGFBP-1, leptin and adiponectin levels, and body composition by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Their data were compared to that of 62 (27F, 35M) appropriate for gestational age (AGA) children., RESULTS: SGA and AGA children had similar height standard deviation score (SDS) corrected for parental height and body mass index (BMI) SDS. Homeostasis model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was significantly high in SGA (0.7 +/- 0.6) than in AGA children (0.4 +/- 0.2) (P = 0.029). There were no significant differences in leptin, IGFBP-1, adiponectin, and total and truncal fat between SGA and AGA children. However, being born SGA and having higher BMI in the upper half for the distribution in the sample, although within normal ranges, was associated with lower adiponectin levels (estimated means of log adiponectin levels 3.8 +/- 0.3 vs. 4.4 +/- 0.1 microg/ml, P = 0.040)., CONCLUSIONS: SGA children with CUG and with no obesity have higher insulin levels compared to AGA children. Both SGA birth and recent size seem to have an effect on serum adiponectin levels in childhood.

AB  - Introduction: Gestational weight gain is an important modifiable factor known to influence fetal outcomes including birth weight and adiposity. Leptin is normally correlated with adiposity and is also known to increase throughout pregnancy, as the placenta becomes a source of leptin synthesis. Several studies have reported positive correlations between cord blood leptin level and either birthweight or size for gestational age, as well as body mass index (BMI). Objective: To determine the correlation of prenatal leptin concentration in pregnant adolescents with their gestational weight gain, postpartum weight retention, and weight/length of their newborn. Methods: A cohort study was conducted on pregnant Mexican adolescents from Gestational Week 26-28 to three months postpartum (n = 168 mother-child dyads). An anthropometric assessment was made of each pregnant adolescent, and the serum level of leptin and the intake of energy were determined. The newborn was evaluated each month during postpartum. Clinical records were reviewed to obtain sociodemographic data. Bivariate correlations, tests for repeating measurements and logistic regression models were performed. Results: Leptin concentration gradually increased during the third trimester of pregnancy. At Gestation Week 36, leptin level correlated with gestational weight gain. When comparing adolescents that had the lowest and highest concentration of leptin, the former presented a mean of 6 kg less in gestational weight gain (inter-subject leptin concentration, p = 0.001; inter-subject energy intake, p = 0.497). Leptin concentration and gestational weight gain exerted an effect on the weight of the newborn (inter-subject leptin concentration for Week 32, p = 0.024; inter-subject gestational weight gain, p = 0.011). Newborn length was associated with leptin concentration at Week 28 (leptin effect, p = 0.003; effect of gestational weight gain, p = 0.722). Conclusions: Pregnant adolescents with leptin concentration over 20 ng/mL showed a greater gestational weight gain. Leptin concentration correlated with length and weight of the newborn.

AB  - AIM: Leptin is a proteic hormone, isolated in 1994, mainly synthetized in the white adipose tissue. Aim of this study was to compare leptin concentrations in normal pregnancies with those measured in pregnancies complicated by gestational diabetes or gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia., METHODS: We enrolled 48 pregnant women: 18 with uncomplicated pregnancy, 11 with gestational diabetes, 19 with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia. Leptin concentrations were measured in maternal serum at enrollment, together with insulin and cortisol, at delivery and in the immediate postpartum. At delivery serum leptin was calculated in the cord blood too., RESULTS: Fasting plasma leptin and insulin were higher in the group of patients with gestational hypertension, than in the other groups. Third-trimester maternal leptin concentrations correlated significantly with insulin levels in the group of women with gestational diabetes and in the group with gestational hypertension or pre-eclampsia, but not in the women with an uncomplicated pregnancy., CONCLUSIONS: Leptin concentrations in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disorders are significantly higher than in normal pregnancies. The increased leptin concentrations are independent of associated proteinuria, as women with simple gestational hypertension and preeclampsia showed comparable third-trimester leptin concentrations. In both women with gestational diabetes and women with hypertensive disorders, serum leptin correlated closely with serum insulin, suggesting that the association between leptin and insulin resistance is preserved in pregnancy. Whatever the reasons for an increased maternal leptin production in pregnancies complicated by hypertension, maternal leptin homeostasis does not seem to influence foetal serum leptin concentrations, which seems to be mainly related to birth weight.

AB  - Overview: The mechanisms through which intrauterine exposures affect the metabolic outcomes of the offspring are poorly understood. Adipokines, leptin and adiponectin correlate with adult and childhood adiposity, but it is unclear how exposure to these adipokines during gestation relates to offspring growth. Objective(s): To evaluate the relation between maternal and umbilical cord adipokines; leptin and adiponectin and the gestational weight in newborns. Subjects and methods: 50 mother-infant pairs (N = 100). Maternal serum, as well as Umbilical cord blood adipokines, leptin, and adiponectin levels, were determined. Anthropometrics measurements of these newborns and their mothers were obtained by trained examiners. Result(s): Lower serum maternal and higher cord leptin and higher maternal adiponectin are associated with increased newborn birth weight compared with infants with a normal weight for age (P < 0.05). Cord blood leptin concentrations were significantly higher in infants born to obese vs. normal weight women. On the other hand, cord blood adiponectin was similar, comparing gestational obese to normal-weight women. Conclusion(s): There is a relation between High umbilical cord blood leptin level.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The acylation stimulating protein (ASP) is a potent lipogenic adipokine that correlates with postprandial triglyceride (TG) clearance and is linked to the pathophysiology of obesity and related disorders., OBJECTIVE: To investigate ASP levels in cord blood and its relation to maternal and cord blood lipid parameters and fetal birth weight., METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Thirty nondiabetic pregnant women, their newborns, and thirty-three nonpregnant controls were included in this study. Fasting maternal and cord blood ASP, TGs, nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs), cholesterol, glucose levels, in addition to maternal BMI and fetal birth weight were measured., RESULTS: No significant difference was found between cord blood ASP (16.3 +/- 0.96 nmol/l) and ASP levels in the adult controls (15.7 +/- 1.0 nmol/l). Cord blood ASP, however, was lower than maternal plasma ASP levels (25.4 +/- 1.6 nmol/l, P < 0.001). Yet, lipid levels in cord blood, particularly TGs were markedly decreased compared to control and maternal TG levels (threefold and 7.4-fold, P < 0.001 respectively). Maternal TGs significantly correlated with fetal birth weight (r = 0.54, P = 0.002). Multiple regression analysis showed that maternal TGs (beta = 0.57, P = 0.01) and NEFAs (beta = 0.43, P = 0.024) predicted 45% variation in cord blood ASP levels, independent of all measured maternal and cord blood parameters. Cord blood ASP showed a positive correlation with fetal birth weight (r = 0.524, P = 0.037) in neonates above average fetal birth weight of the studied population., DISCUSSION: This is the first study investigating ASP in cord blood. We suggest that maternal hypertriglyceridemia is associated with increased fetal ASP production, thus enhancing fetal fat storage independent of maternal glucose variations in nondiabetic women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of body weight, body composition, parental obesity, and metabolic variables on the development of obesity in a large cohort of 5-year-old Native American children with a high propensity for obesity., METHODS: During the summer months of 1992 to 1995 and again 5 years later, 138 (65 boys and 73 girls) 5-year-old Pima Indian children were studied. Height; weight; body composition; parental obesity; and fasting plasma insulin, glucose, and leptin concentrations were determined at baseline and follow-up. Linear regression models were used to assess the effect of the baseline variables on the development of obesity., RESULTS: At both 5 and 10 years of age, Pima Indian children were heavier and fatter than an age- and gender-matched reference population. All anthropometric and metabolic variables tracked strongly from 5 to 10 years of age (r > or = 0.70). The most significant determinant of percentage of body fat at 10 years of age was percentage of body fat at 5 years of age (R(2) = 0.53). The combined effect of high maternal body mass index, elevated fasting plasma leptin concentrations, and low fasting plasma insulin concentrations at baseline explained an additional 4% of the total variance in adiposity at follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Although parental obesity and metabolic variables such as insulinemia and leptinemia at baseline account for a small percentage of the variance in adiposity at follow-up, early childhood obesity is the dominant predictor of obesity 5 years later. These results suggest that strategies to prevent childhood obesity must be initiated at a very early age.

AB  - To assess whether adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) polymorphism is associated with intrauterine fetal growth and cord blood adiponectin, we investigated eight single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; rs182052, rs710445, rs16861205, rs12495941, rs1501299, rs3774261, rs2082940 and rs266729) in ADIPOQ and birth weight and cord blood adiponectin in 526 healthy neonates. We found that the neonates carrying the G allele of rs266729 had a significantly greater birth weight s.d. score than those homozygous for the C allele (CC: -0.06+/-0.75 versus CG: 0.20+/-0.64 versus GG: 0.07+/-0.78; P=1.65 x 10(-3), adjusted P=9.90 x 10(-3)). However, this difference was not significant after adjustment for cord blood adiponectin (P=0.04, adjusted P=0.26). The rs266729 SNP was strongly associated with cord blood adiponectin; neonates with rs266729 GG had the highest adiponectin (CC: 34.1+/-20.2 versus CG: 44.3+/-26.1 versus GG: 54.1+/-36.7 mug ml(-1), P=2.80 x 10(-9), adjusted P=1.68 x 10(-8)). This association remained after adjustment for birth weight s.d. score (P=6.63 x 10(-8), adjusted P=3.98 x 10(-7)). Our results suggest that the influence of the rs266729 SNP in ADIPOQ on birth weight may be dependent on circulating adiponectin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, one of the adipocytokines, is postulated to play a key role in fetal growth, probably enhancing the growth-promoting effect of insulin through insulin-sensitizing action., OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: To examine how different intrauterine or postnatal growth patterns relate to adiponectin secretion, we measured serum adiponectin concentrations in 30 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) and 19 small-for-gestational-age (SGA) preterm infants on the first day of life and at term-equivalent age., RESULTS: The serum levels of adiponectin increased significantly in all preterm infants from birth to term-equivalent age. The adiponectin levels at term-equivalent age were significantly higher in the AGA than in the SGA group [mean (SD) 40.4 (12.3) vs. 28.4 (10.4) mug/ml; p < 0.01] after adjustment for gestational age or term-equivalent body weight. The increase in adiponectin levels from birth to term-equivalent age was significantly higher in the AGA than in the SGA group, and was positively correlated with the weight gain rate (g/kg/day) in the combined groups (r = 0.37, p < 0.01). A multiple regression analysis with the adiponectin increase from birth to term-equivalent age as the dependent variable for all the subjects revealed that only weight gain rate was independently associated with the adiponectin increase., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the change in serum adiponectin levels may reflect postnatal growth from birth to term-equivalent age in preterm infants.

AB  - Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that decreases food intake and body weight via its receptor in the hypothalamus. In rodents, it also modulates glucose metabolism by increasing insulin sensitivity. We previously reported that leptin is produced by human placental trophoblasts. We also revealed that leptin gene expression in the placenta was augmented in severe pre-eclampsia, and suggested that placental hypoxia may play a role in this augmentation. Maternal plasma leptin levels correlated well with mean blood pressure, but not with body mass index. Plasma leptin levels in pre-eclamptic women with IUGR were higher than those without IUGR (P< 0.05). We further examined the effects of hyperleptinemia on the course of pregnancy by using transgenic mice (Tg) overexpressing leptin. In pregnant Tg mice, food intake was significantly less than non-Tg, and the fetal body weights were reduced to approximately 70 per cent of those of non-Tg. Resistin is a novel adipocyte-derived hormone that decreases insulin sensitivity and increases plasma glucose concentration, thus contributing the development of obesity-related type II diabetes mellitus. We recently found that resistin gene is expressed in the human placenta as well as adipose tissue. In this review, possible roles of placental leptin and resistin are discussed.

AB  - Leptin was initially identified as an adipocyte-derived hormone that decreases food intake and body weight via its receptor in the hypothalamus. Subsequent animal studies revealed various physiologic functions of leptin. Leptin plays an essential role in reproduction by regulating gonadotropin-releasing hormone secretion from the hypothalamus. It also modulates glucose metabolism by increasing insulin sensitivity and activates the sympathetic nervous system. In humans, leptin is also produced by placental trophoblasts and is secreted into both the maternal and fetal circulation. Leptin production in the placenta is increased in pregnancies complicated with several pathologic conditions. Leptin gene expression in the placenta is augmented in severe preeclampsia, and maternal plasma leptin levels in severe preeclampsia are significantly higher than those in normotensive pregnant women. Leptin production in the placenta is also increased in diabetic pregnancy with insulin treatment. Furthermore, leptin is proposed to play a functional role in implantation by virtue of its stimulatory effect on matrix metalloproteinase expression in cytotrophoblast. Dysregulation of leptin metabolism and/or function in the placenta may be implicated in the pathogenesis of various disorders during pregnancy, such as recurrent miscarriage, gestational diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation, and preeclampsia. In this review, possible roles of placental leptin are discussed.

AB  - Depending on the definitions used, up to 10% of all live-born neonates are small for gestational age (SGA). Although the vast majority of these children show catch-up growth by 2 yr of age, one in 10 does not. It is increasingly recognized that those who are born SGA are at risk of developing metabolic disease later in life. Reduced fetal growth has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The majority of pathology is seen in adults who show spontaneous catch-up growth as children. There is evidence to suggest that some of the metabolic consequences of intrauterine growth retardation in children born SGA can be mitigated by ensuring early appropriate catch-up growth, while avoiding excessive weight gain. Implicitly, this argument questions current infant formula feeding practices. The risk is less clear for individuals who do not show catch-up growth and who are treated with GH for short stature. Recent data, however, suggest that long-term treatment with GH does not increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the metabolic syndrome in young adults born SGA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effect leptin on fetal growth in healthy and infected newborns is not well known. This study is aimed at: 1) evaluating serum leptin concentration in full term and preterm, healthy and infected newborns, according to their gender, birth asphyxia, intrauterine and neonatal infections, and 2) assessing the correlation between serum leptin levels and anthropometric parameters among healthy and infected newborns., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study involved 146 newborns: 73 full-term and 73 preterm, 86 male and 60 female, 56 healthy and 90 infected, aged from 2nd to 4th day of life. Anthropometric parameters, including: birth weight, length, head and chest circumference, and serum leptin concentration were measured in all the subjects. Intrauterine and neonatal infections were diagnosed by the standard criteria., RESULTS: In this study, it was found that both healthy and infected, but full-term newborns had significantly higher mean leptin concentration than the premature ones (p<0.05). Statistically significant (p<0.05), positive correlations were found between serum leptin level and gestational age, birth weight, head and chest circumference, both in healthy, and in infected newborns., CONCLUSIONS: Findings of this study suggest that the serum leptin concentration in full term newborns is higher than in the preterm ones, and in females it is higher than in males, 2) among both healthy and infected newborns, there is a positive, linear correlation between the serum leptin concentration and anthropometric parameters, 3) intrauterine and neonatal infections do not have a significant influence on serum leptin concentration. The role of leptin in fetal growth deserves further research.

AB  - Objectives: C-reactive protein (CRP) has been shown to correlate with health-related quality of life (HRQL) in some chronic medical conditions. However, these associations have not yet described in spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, we tried to identify biomarkers associated with HRQL in SCI. Design: Cross-sectional. Setting: Tertiary rehabilitation center. Participants: Referred patients to Brain and Spinal Cord Injury Research Center between November 2010 and April 2013. Outcome Measure: Blood samples were taken to measure circulatory CRP, leptin, adiponectin, ferritin, parathyroid hormone, calcitonin, thyroid hormones, fasting plasma glucose and lipid profile. All the analyses were performed with adjustment for injury-related confounders (level of injury, injury completeness and time since injury) and demographic characteristics. HRQL was measured with Short Form health survey (SF-36). Results: The initial inverse association between CRP and total score of SF-36 (P: 0.006, r = -0.28) was lost after adjustment for confounders. However, the negative correlation between CRP and Mental Component Summary (MCS) remained significant (P: 0.0005, r = -0.38). Leptin level was inversely correlated with Physical Component Summary (PCS) (P: 0.02, r = -0.30). Conclusion: Although CRP and leptin levels were not related with total scores of SF-36 questionnaire, CRP can be more useful in determining mental component of HRQL whereas leptin can be a determinant of physical component. The combined consideration of these two biomarkers may help to predict HRQL in individuals with SCI.

AB  - BACKGROUND CONTEXT: Previously, the associations between leptin and adiponectin levels with bone mineral density (BMD) have been reported in different populations, and occasionally, controversial results have been demonstrated. Until now, these relationships in spinal cord-injured individuals have not yet been described. PURPOSE: We tried to investigate the correlation between leptin and adiponectin concentrations in plasma and BMD in Iranian patients with spinal cord injury (SCI). STUDY DESIGN/SETTING: Cross-sectional investigation. PATIENT SAMPLE: Referred patients with SCI who did not meet our exclusion criteria such as pregnancy, lactation, amputation, history of diabetes, cancer, endocrinology disease, and use of special medications entered the study. OUTCOME MEASURES: Bone mineral density of femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanteric zone, total hip, and lumbar vertebrae assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and serum leptin and adiponectin levels measured by blood sample analysis using immunoassay techniques. METHODS: Patient demographic characteristics were measured during face-to-face visits. Injury level and Spinal cord Injury Association (ASIA) score were assessed by clinical examination and were confirmed by imaging aids. Measured levels of leptin and adiponectin and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry results were analyzed with partial correlation analysis method after adjustment for weight, body mass index (BMI), and age. RESULTS: Total of 104 patients (19 females and 85 males) entered this investigation. Higher leptin concentration was significantly associated with higher BMD in femoral neck (p=.006, r=0.73), femoral intertrochanteric zone (p=.001, r=0.83), and hip (p=.001, r=0.81) only in female patients, whereas no such association was detected in male participants after adjusting for BMI and age. Leptin and adiponectin levels were not associated with lumbar spine BMD in both genders. Neither injury level nor ASIA score and plegia type (paraplegia or tetraplegia) influenced on leptin and adiponectin concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between leptin concentration and BMD in male individuals, whereas a positive correlation between leptin and BMD of femoral neck, intertrochanter, and hip was observed in female patients that shows a sexual polymorphism in this relationship. However, by considering the low number of female participants, these results should be interpreted cautiously. Lumbar spine BMD was associated with neither leptin nor adiponectin level in both genders. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Consumption of fructose-rich diets in the United States is on the rise and thought to be associated with obesity and cardiometabolic diseases. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine the effects of antenatal exposure to high-fructose diet on offspring's development of metabolic syndrome-like phenotype and other cardiovascular disease risk factors later in life. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant C57BL/6J dams were randomly allocated to fructose solution (10% wt/vol, n = 10) or water (n = 10) as the only drinking fluid from day 1 of pregnancy until delivery. After weaning, pups were started on regular chow, and evaluated at 1 year of life. We measured percent visceral adipose tissue and liver fat infiltrates using computed tomography, and blood pressure using CODA nonivasive monitor. Intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing with corresponding insulin concentrations were obtained. Serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, leptin, and adiponectin were measured in duplicate using standardized assays. Fasting homeostatic model assessment was also calculated to assess insulin resistance. P values < .05 were considered statistically significant. RESULTS: Maternal weight, pup number, and average weight at birth were similar between the 2 groups. Male and female fructose group offspring had higher peak glucose and area under the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing curve compared with control, and higher mean arterial pressure compared to control. Female fructose group offspring were heavier and had higher percent visceral adipose tissue, liver fat infiltrates, homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance scores, insulin area under the intraperitoneal glucose tolerance testing curve, and serum concentrations of leptin, and lower concentrations of adiponectin compared to female control offspring. No significant differences in these parameters were noted in male offspring. Serum concentrations of triglycerides or total cholesterol were not different between the 2 groups for either gender. CONCLUSION: Maternal intake of high fructose leads to fetal programming of adult obesity, hypertension, and metabolic dysfunction, all risk factors for cardiovascular disease. This fetal programming is more pronounced in female offspring. Limiting intake of high fructoseeenriched diets in pregnancy may have significant impact on long-term health.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Preterm birth has been associated with altered body composition, especially increased fat mass (FM) and decreased bone mineralization, and leptin and IGF-1 have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of both. We aimed to study the interplay between leptin, IGF-1, FM and bone mineralization measured in infancy and childhood of children born preterm., DESIGN: Observational study., PATIENTS/SUBJECTS: Seventy-nine (40 boys) preterm-born children (gestational age <=32 weeks and/or birth weight <=1500 g) aged 8 years., MEASUREMENTS: Serum leptin and IGF-1 were measured at term age, at 3- and 6-month corrected age (CA), and 8 years. Body composition (fat and lean mass) and bone parameters (bone area, mineral content and density) were measured by Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at term age, 6-month CA and 8 years., RESULTS: Leptin was positively associated with FM at all time points and with bone parameters at term age and 6-month CA. IGF-1 was associated with body composition and bone density at most of the time points. Explained variation in bone mineralization increased significantly by adding bone area (BA) and height to the models., CONCLUSIONS: During infancy and childhood, leptin and IGF-1 were associated with body composition in preterm-born children. In addition, leptin was associated with bone parameters in early infancy, but not in childhood. It is hypothesized that a complicated interplay between multiple pathways, which most likely changes over time, is involved in regulation of body composition and bone mineralization of preterm-born infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare body composition and metabolic outcomes at 7-9 years in offspring of women with gestational diabetes (GDM) randomized to metformin (+/-insulin) or insulin treatment during pregnancy., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Children were assessed at 7 years in Adelaide (n=109/181) and 9 years in Auckland (n=99/396) by anthropometry, bioimpedance analysis (BIA), dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (n=92/99) and fasting bloods (n=82/99)., RESULTS: In the Adelaide subgroup, mothers were similar at enrollment. Women randomized to metformin versus insulin had higher treatment glycemia (p=0.002) and more infants with birth weight >90th percentile (20.7% vs 5.9%; p=0.029). At 7 years, there were no differences in offspring measures. In Auckland, at enrollment, women randomized to metformin had a higher body mass index (BMI) (p=0.08) but gained less weight during treatment (p=0.07). Offspring birth measures were similar. At 9 years, metformin offspring were larger by measures of weight, arm and waist circumferences, waist:height (p<0.05); BMI, triceps skinfold (p=0.05); DXA fat mass and lean mass (p=0.07); MRI abdominal fat volume (p=0.051). Body fat percent was similar between treatment groups by DXA and BIA. Abdominal fat percentages (visceral adipose tissue, subcutaneous adipose tissue and liver) were similar by MRI. Fasting glucose, triglyceride, insulin, insulin resistance, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), cholesterol, liver transaminases, leptin and adiponectin were similar., CONCLUSIONS: Metformin or insulin for GDM was associated with similar offspring total and abdominal body fat percent and metabolic measures at 7-9 years. Metformin-exposed children were larger at 9 years. Metformin may interact with fetal environmental factors to influence offspring outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipokines are involved in the regulation of many inflammatory processes and are present at very high concentrations in cord blood of term infants., OBJECTIVE: We analysed data of a large prospective birth cohort study to examine whether adiponectin and leptin concentration in cord blood are determinants of wheezing disorders in children within the first 2 years of life., METHODS: Seven hundred and forty mothers and their newborns were included in this analysis. Adiponectin and leptin concentrations were measured in cord blood. The cumulative incidence of physician-reported asthma or obstructive bronchitis was recorded during a 2-year follow-up., RESULTS: During the first 2 years of life, asthma or obstructive bronchitis was reported by the caring paediatricians for 157 (19.6%) of the children. We found a strong interaction of cord blood adiponectin and history of atopic disease in the mother with respect to the risk of physician-reported asthma or obstructive bronchitis (P=0.006). Compared with children with cord blood levels in the middle quintile (reference category), the odds ratios for physician-reported asthma or obstructive bronchitis in the bottom quintile and top quintile were 0.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02-0.90] and 2.12 (95% CI 0.67-6.66), respectively (P for trend=0.0003), among children of mothers with a history of atopy. This association was independent of other established risk factors. Leptin levels in cord blood were not associated with risk of asthma or obstructive bronchitis., CONCLUSIONS: In children of mothers with a history of atopy, concentrations of adiponectin in cord blood could play an important role in determining risk of wheezing disorders in early childhood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether periadolescent children demonstrate the significant racial/ethnic differences in body fatness relative to BMI and in the prevalence and relationship of body composition to risk factors for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) as in adults., DESIGN AND METHODS: Family history of obesity and T2DM, anthropometry, insulin sensitivity and secretory capacity, lipids, and cytokines (IL-6, CRP, TNF-alpha, and adiponectin) were examined in a cohort of 994 middle school students (47% male, 53%, female; 12% African American, 14% East Asian, 13% South Asian, 9% Caucasian, 44% Hispanic, and 8% other)., RESULTS: Fractional body fat content was significantly greater at any BMI among South Asians. There were racial/ethnic specific differences in lipid profiles, insulin secretory capacity, insulin sensitivity, and inflammatory markers corrected for body fatness that are similar to those seen in adults. Family history of T2DM was associated with lower insulin secretory capacity while family history of obesity was more associated with insulin resistance., CONCLUSIONS: Children show some of the same racial/ethnic differences in risk factors for adiposity-related comorbidities as adults.

AB  - Maternal adiponectin levels are inversely correlated to birth weight, suggesting that maternal adiponectin limits fetal growth. We hypothesized that full-length adiponectin (fADN) infusion in pregnant mice down-regulates placental amino acid transporters and decreases fetal growth. Starting at embryonic day (E) 14.5, fADN(0.62 +/- 0.02 mu g (gbodyweight)(-1) day(-1), n = 7) or vehicle (control, n = 9) were infused in pregnant C57/BL6 mice by mini-osmotic pump. At E18.5, dams were killed and placental homogenates and trophoblast plasma membrane (TPM) vesicles were prepared. Infusion of fADN elevated maternal serum fADN by 4-fold and decreased fetal weights by 18%. Adiponectin receptor 2, but not adiponectin receptor 1, was expressed in TPM. fADN infusion decreased TPM System A (-56%, P < 0.001) and System L amino acid transporter activity (-50%, P < 0.03). TPM protein expression of SNAT1, 2 and 4 (System A amino acid transporter isoforms) and LAT1 and LAT2, but not CD98, (System L amino acid transporter isoforms) was down-regulated by fADN infusion. To identify possible mechanisms underlying these changes we determined the phosphorylation of proteins in signalling pathways known to regulate placental amino acid transporters. fADN decreased phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (Tyr-608), Akt (Thr-308 and Ser-473), S6 kinase 1 (Thr-389), eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (Thr-37/46 and Thr-70) and ribosomal protein S6 (Ser-235/236) and increased the phosphorylation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor a (PPARa) (Ser-21) in the placenta. These data suggest that maternal adiponectin decreases fetal growth by down-regulation of placental amino acid transporters, which limits fetal nutrient availability. This effect may be mediated by inhibition of insulin/IGF-I and mTOR signalling pathways, which are positive regulators of placental amino acid transporters. We have identified a novel physiological mechanism by which the endocrine functions of maternal adipose tissue influence fetal growth.

AB  - During pregnancy, fetal glucose production is suppressed, with rapid activation immediately postpartum. Fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP4) was recently demonstrated as a regulator of hepatic glucose production and systemic metabolism in animal models. Here, we studied the role of FABP4 in regulating neonatal glucose hemostasis. Serum samples were collected from pregnant women with normoglycemia or gestational diabetes at term, from the umbilical circulation, and from the newborns within 6 hours of life. The level of FABP4 was higher in the fetal versus maternal circulation, with a further rise in neonates after birth of approximately 3-fold. Neonatal FABP4 inversely correlated with blood glucose, with an approximately 10-fold increase of FABP4 in hypoglycemic neonates. When studied in mice, blood glucose of 12-hour-old WT, Fabp4(-/+), and Fabp4(-/-) littermate mice was 59 +/- 13 mg/dL, 50 +/- 11 mg/dL, and 43 +/- 11 mg/dL, respectively. Similar to our observations in humans, FABP4 levels in WT mouse neonates were approximately 8-fold higher compared with those in adult mice. RNA sequencing of the neonatal liver suggested altered expression of multiple glucagon-regulated pathways in Fabp4(-/-) mice. Indeed, Fabp4(-/-) liver glycogen was inappropriately intact, despite a marked hypoglycemia, with rapid restoration of normoglycemia upon injection of recombinant FABP4. Our data suggest an important biological role for the adipokine FABP4 in the orchestrated regulation of postnatal glucose metabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relation between weight deficit at birth and IGF-I, IGFBP-I, Leptin, and AFP levels in amniotic fluid after 14-18 weeks; to assess the diagnostic usefulness of these biochemical markers., STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective study. Amniocentesis was performed in pregnant women after 14-18 weeks of gestation., STUDY POPULATION: 86 controls, 18 IUGR <10 percentile, and 17 IUGR <5 percentile., RESULTS: No significant correlation was found between severity of IUGR and IGF-I, IGFBP-I, or Leptin. AFP was inversely correlated with severity of IUGR; results for the IUGR <10 percentile were: S: 65.7%, SP: 56.9%, PPV: 38.3%, NPV: 80.3%, and an overall diagnostic capacity of 65.6%. Results for the IUGR <5 percentile were: S: 76.4%, SP: 54.8%, PPV: 21.6%, NPV: 93.4% were obtained, and an overall capacity of 70.6%., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated values of AFP in amniotic fluid may help early detection of populations at risk of developing IUGR.

AB  - Preeclampsia (PE), a pregnancy-specific disorder, is characterized by maternal hypertension and proteinuria or another accompa-nying sign/symptom of multiorgan dysfunction. Maternal symptoms resolve with delivery of the baby and, importantly, the pla-centa. Therefore, the placenta plays a causal role in PE. However, the precise cause of abnormal placental development and/or function is unknown. Women with obesity have an increased risk of developing PE that is potentially related to the increased inflammation that accompanies increased maternal adiposity. Furthermore, inflammatory adipokines, i.e., leptin, have been linked to the development of systemic inflammation, hypertension, and other adverse outcomes associated with PE. Rodent models that recapitulate key pathophysiological features of the maternal and fetal syndrome have been used translationally to study PE. This review covers inflammatory adipokines, immune cells, and impaired placental development associated with PE in women and in rodent models of PE that use functional genomics to test causation.

AB  - Leptin, the product of the ob/ob gene in rodents, regulates energy balance and fertility. Two genetic models, the ob/ob mouse (deletion of leptin protein) and the db/db mouse (deletion of leptin receptor) have markedly augmented research in obesity. Human obesity is more closely linked to leptin resistance than to the absence of leptin. Serum leptin concentrations reflect the size of the subcutaneous fat depot better than total fat mass or abdominal visceral fat. At the initiation of puberty there is a divergence in circulating leptin concentrations between boys and girls. In boys, leptin concentrations increase and then markedly decrease to prepubertal concentration levels. In girls there are only increasing concentrations. The authors believe these patterns are relevant to the markedly different alterations in the regional distribution of body fat that occurs in boys and girls at puberty.

AB  - X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), a potentially fatal neurometabolic disorder with no effective pharmacological treatment, is characterized by clinical manifestations ranging from progressive spinal cord axonopathy [adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN)] to severe demyelination and neuroinflammation (cerebral ALD-cALD), for which molecular mechanisms are not well known. Leriglitazone is a recently developed brain penetrant full PPAR gamma agonist that could modulate multiple biological pathways relevant for neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative diseases, and particularly for X-ALD. We found that leriglitazone decreased oxidative stress, increased adenosine 5'-triphosphate concentration, and exerted neuroprotective effects in primary rodent neurons and astrocytes after very long chain fatty acid-induced toxicity simulating X-ALD. In addition, leriglitazone improved motor function; restored markers of oxidative stress, mitochondrial function, and inflammation in spinal cord tissues from AMN mouse models; and decreased the neurological disability in the EAE neuroinflammatory mouse model. X-ALD monocyte-derived patient macrophages treated with leriglitazone were less skewed toward an inflammatory phenotype, and the adhesion of human X-ALD monocytes to brain endothelial cells decreased after treatment, suggesting the potential of leriglitazone to prevent the progression to pathologically disrupted blood-brain barrier. Leriglitazone increased myelin debris clearance in vitro and increased myelination and oligodendrocyte survival in demyelination-remyelination in vivo models, thus promoting remyelination. Last, leriglitazone was clinically tested in a phase 1 study showing central nervous system target engagement (adiponectin increase) and changes on inflammatory biomarkers in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid. The results of our study support the use of leriglitazone in X-ALD and, more generally, in other neuroinflammatory and neurodegenerative conditions.

AB  - Introduction: Prematurity, a well-established risk factor for various intestinal diseases in newborns, results in increased morbidity and mortality. However, the intestinal inflammatory status of preterm (PT) infants has been poorly characterized. Here we have broadly described the intestinal and systemic inflammatory status of PT children. Materials and Methods: Meconium and plasma from 39 PT and 32 full term (T) newborns were studied. Fecal calprotectin, polymorphonuclear leukocyte elastase (PMN-E), TNF, IL-17A, IL-8, IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1, IL-1beta, IL-1alpha, and E-selectin and the enzymatic activities of myeloperoxidase (MPO) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) in meconium were measured. Plasma levels of AP, hepatocyte growth factor, nerve growth factor (NGF), proinflammatory cytokines, leptin, adiponectin, PAI-1, and resistin were also determined. Correlations with gestational age (GA) and birth weight (BW) were studied. Results: Neutrophil derived PMN-E, MPO and calprotectin were increased in the meconium of PT compared to T newborns, while AP was decreased. No significant differences were found in other inflammatory parameters. Considering data from all children, GA and BW showed inverse correlation with neutrophil markers, while AP directly correlated with BW. Plasma levels of IL-1beta and NGF were enhanced in PT infants, and were also negatively correlated with BW. PT children additionally showed neutropenia and decreased adiponectin, leptin, haematocrit, and haemoglobin. These parameters (neutrophils, adiponectin, and so forth) were positively correlated with GA and BW, while IL-8, MCP-1, PAI-1, and plasma AP were negatively correlated. PT children showing postnatal morbidity exhibited increased meconium MPO and MIP-1alpha. Conclusion: PT neonates present a significant elevation of intestinal inflammatory parameters, characterized by the presence of neutrophil markers, associated with mild systemic inflammation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal growth improves in pregnant women who take daily maternal multiple micronutrients [United Nations International Multiple Micronutrient Preparation (UNIMMAP)] rather than iron and folic acid (IFA) alone., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to test whether such an effect was mediated by changes in concentrations of cord hormones., DESIGN: In a double-blind, controlled trial carried out in Burkina Faso, we randomly assigned 1426 pregnant women to receive UNIMMAP or IFA supplements. We measured concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), leptin, insulin, free thyroxine, and cortisol in cord serum in a subsample of 294 live single newborns. We performed mediation analysis with an Aroian test., RESULTS: UNIMMAP supplementation had no significant effect on cord hormone concentrations. However, UNIMMAP supplementation significantly affected concentrations of IGF-I (+30%; 95% CI: 8%, 52%; P = 0.009) and leptin in male newborns. In these infants, 51.1% (P = 0.08) of the effect of UNIMMAP supplementation on birth weight was mediated through IGF-I, whereas for female newborns, this proportion was negligible. UNIMMAP supplementation also increased cortisol concentrations by 36% (P = 0.009) in cord blood in primiparae (P for interaction = 0.02). Growth-retarded infants had 41.2% lower IGF-I (P < 0.0001) and 27.3% lower leptin (P = 0.04) than did infants with normal growth. Offspring of primiparae had reduced IGF-I and insulin concentrations, and their cortisol concentrations were 25% higher (P = 0.05). Male newborns had lower concentrations of IGF-I, leptin, and insulin than did female newborns., CONCLUSIONS: UNIMMAP supplementation had sex-specific effects on cord IGF-I and leptin concentrations that were of unclear clinical significance. Other pathways may have been involved in the action of UNIMMAP on fetal growth. The specific hormonal pattern in primiparae could be related to constrained fetal growth. Confirmatory studies are warranted. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00642408.

AB  - Several studies show an association of adiponectin deficiency with obesity, insulin resistance and dysfunctional fat metabolism. This study investigates to what extent the correlations described occurs in pregnant women. Metabolism parameters and adiponectin serum levels were measured in 32 pregnant women at various times during their pregnancies and during the first six postpartum weeks. In this random group of pregnant subjects no correlation was found between adiponectin and insulin, C-peptides, blood sugar levels or BMI. No correlation was found between adiponectin and carbohydrate metabolism. The adiponectin levels of the pregnant women correlated negatively with triglyceride levels during the various stages of pregnancy; in the 36th week of gestation and at 6 weeks after the birth a positive correlation with HDL cholesterol was observed. The decrease in adiponectin concentration in pregnancy must therefore be more closely connected with changes in fat metabolism than with an increase in insulin resistance or weight gain during the pregnancy. The decrease in adiponectin does not correlate with an increase in body fat, BMI or weight; however, it does correlate with metabolism. The mechanisms of the regulation, which causes adiponectin levels to fall, is still unknown.

AB  - Mothers confer natural passive immunization to their infants through the transplacental pathway during the gestation period. The objective of the present study was to establish at birth the maternal and cord plasma concentration and relationship of immunoglobulins (Igs), cytokines (CKs), and adipokines. In addition, the impact of the maternal microbiota and diet was explored. The plasma profile of these components was different between mothers and babies, with the levels of many CKs, IgM, IgG2a, IgE, IgA, and leptin significantly higher in mothers than in the cord sample. Moreover, the total Igs, all IgG subtypes, IgE, and the Th1/Th2 ratio positively correlated in the mother-infant pair. Maternal dietary components such as monounsaturated fatty acids-polyunsaturated fatty acids and fiber were positively associated with some immune factors such as IgA in cord samples. The microbiota composition clustering also influenced the plasma profile of some factors (i.e., many CKs, some Ig, and adiponectin). In conclusion, we have established the concentration of these immunomodulatory factors in the maternal-neonatal pair at birth, some positive associations, and the influence of maternal diet and the microbiota composition, suggesting that the immune status during pregnancy, in terms of CKs and Igs levels, can influence the immune status of the infant at birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Excessive gestational weight gain (GWG) during pregnancy is associated with adverse outcomes for mothers and offspring. Early, mid, and late pregnancy GWGs have different associations with fetal growth and later life adiposity, but associations with cord blood hormones, which might predict later health, are not well studied., METHODS: In 978 pregnant women from the pre-birth Project Viva cohort, we calculated trimester-specific GWG using clinically recorded prenatal weights. Outcomes were levels of umbilical cord blood hormones related to fetal and postnatal growth. We used linear regression models adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity, pre-pregnancy BMI, parity, education, pregnancy smoking status and child sex; 2nd and 3rd trimester models were additionally adjusted for GWG in prior trimesters., RESULTS: Mean+/-SD pre-pregnancy BMI was 24.9+/-5.5kg/m2, 30% were non-white, and 63% were college graduates. Mean+/-SD cord blood hormone levels were insulin-like growth factor [IGF]-1 (56.4+/-24.3ng/mL), IGF-2 (408.5+/-92.7ng/mL), IGFBP-3 (1084+/-318ng/mL), insulin (6.5+/-7.2 uU/mL), C-peptide (1.0+/-0.6ng/mL), leptin (9.0+/-6.6ng/mL) and adiponectin (28.7+/-6.8mug/mL). Mean+/-SD 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimester GWG rates were 0.22+/-0.22, 0.49+/-0.19 and 0.46+/-0.22kg/wk. Greater 1st trimester GWG (per 0.2kg/wk) was associated with higher insulin (0.5 uU/mL; 95% CI 0.1, 0.9) and C-peptide (0.06ng/mL; 95% CI 0.02, 0.09) and lower adiponectin (-0.4mug/mL; 95% CI -0.9, 0.0). Greater 2nd trimester GWG (per 0.2kg/wk) was associated with higher IGF-1 (2.3ng/mL; 95% CI 0.6, 4.0), IGF-2 (7.9ng/mL; 95% CI 1.2, 14.6), IGFBP-3 (41.6ng/mL; 95% CI 19.4, 63.7) and leptin (0.9ng/mL; 0.4, 1.4). 3rd trimester GWG was not associated with cord blood hormones., CONCLUSION: 1st trimester weight gain appears to matter more for cord blood hormones related to offspring glucose/insulin regulation, whereas 2nd trimester gain matters more for hormones related to growth and adiposity.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Offspring of women with gestational diabetes (GDM) exhibit an adverse cardiovascular risk factor profile by as early as age 5 years. Recently, maternal glycemia has been associated with epigenetic modification of genes on the fetal side of the placenta, including those encoding emerging risk factors (adiponectin, leptin), suggesting that vascular differences may emerge even earlier in life. Thus, we sought to evaluate cardiovascular risk factors and determinants thereof in 1-year-old infants of women with and without GDM., METHODS AND RESULTS: Traditional (glucose, lipids) and emerging (C-reactive protein (CRP), adiponectin, leptin) risk factors were assessed in pregnancy in 104 women with (n = 36) and without GDM (n = 68), and at age 1-year in their offspring. In pregnancy, women with GDM had higher triglycerides (2.49 vs 2.10 mmol/L, p = 0.04) and CRP (5.3 vs 3.6 mg/L, p = 0.03), and lower adiponectin (7.3 vs 8.5 mug/mL, p = 0.04) than did their peers. At age 1-year, however, there were no differences in cardiovascular risk factors (including adiponectin) between the infants of women with and without GDM. Of note, maternal and infant adiponectin levels were associated in the non-GDM group (r = 0.39, p = 0.001) but not in the GDM group (r = 0.07, p = 0.67). Furthermore, on multiple linear regression analyses, maternal adiponectin emerged as an independent predictor of infant adiponectin in the non-GDM group only (beta = 776.1, p = 0.0065)., CONCLUSION: Infants of women with and without GDM have a similar cardiovascular risk factor profile at age 1-year. However, there are differences in their early-life determinants of adiponectin that may be relevant to the subsequent vascular risk of GDM offspring. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The delivery of excess maternal nutrients to the fetus is known to increase the risk of macrosomia, even among infants of women without gestational diabetes mellitus. With the current obesity epidemic, maternal adiposity and its associated effects on circulating adipokines and inflammatory proteins may now have a greater impact on fetal growth. We sought to evaluate the independent effects of maternal glycemia, lipids, obesity, adipokines and inflammation on infant birth weight., METHODS: We included 472 women who underwent an oral glucose tolerance test in late pregnancy and were found not to have gestational diabetes; 104 (22.0%) had gestational impaired glucose tolerance. We also measured fasting levels of insulin, low-and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein. Obstetric outcomes were assessed at delivery., RESULTS: The mean birth weight was 3481 g (standard deviation 493 g); 68 of the infants were large for gestational age. On multiple linear regression analysis, positive determinants of birth weight were length of gestation, male infant, weight gain during pregnancy up to the time of the oral glucose tolerance test, body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy and impaired glucose tolerance in pregnancy. Leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein levels were each negatively associated with birth weight. On logistic regression analysis, the significant metabolic predictors of having a large-for-gestational-age infant were BMI before pregnancy (odds ratio [OR] 1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.05-1.27, per 1 kg/m(2) increase), weight gain during pregnancy up to the time of the oral glucose tolerance test (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.05-1.19, per 1 kg increase) and leptin level (OR 0.50, 95% CI 0.30-0.82, per 1 standard deviation change)., INTERPRETATION: Among women without gestational diabetes, maternal adiposity and leptin levels were the strongest metabolic determinants of having a large-for-gestational-age infant rather than glucose intolerance and lipid levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin, a hormone present in breast milk, is involved in energy regulation and metabolism. The purpose of this investigation was to determine whether leptin is present in either preterm breast milk (PBM) or preterm formula (PF). The effects of delivery methods and pasteurization on leptin levels also were evaluated., METHODS: PBM samples were obtained from 29 mothers who delivered infants at between 23 and 34 weeks' gestation. Leptin levels were measured in PBM and PF with the use of a radioimmunoassay specific for human and bovine leptin, respectively. Milk samples were pasteurized by fast- and slow-heating methods. PBM and PF spiked with human leptin were delivered through catheters by bolus and continuous administration to determine the effects of delivery method on recoverable leptin levels., RESULTS: Median PBM leptin concentration was 5.28 ng/mL (intraquartile range: 24.79). Birth gestational age, birth weight, and gender of the infant did not significantly influence PBM leptin levels. Neither bolus nor continuous feeding practices affected leptin levels in PBM or spiked PF. However, pasteurization significantly reduced the amount of detectable leptin in PBM., CONCLUSIONS: PBM leptin levels were highly variable and similar to levels reported for term breast milk. There was no effect of postnatal age on PBM leptin concentrations. Sterilization decreased detectable leptin levels, whereas feeding practices had no adverse effect on the quantity of leptin delivered. Although no infant formula contained leptin, leptin could be added to formula and delivered through various feeding methods without loss.

AB  - CONTEXT: Low cord blood leptin concentration is implicated as a risk factor for small for gestational age (SGA) babies. However, the association of strength, consistency, independence, and confounding factors of this affliction has not been systematically examined., OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a difference in cord blood leptin concentration between SGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns, and to observe whether the sample origins, GA, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and congenital malformation (CM) are confounding factors of the meta-analysis., DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Relevant studies published between 1996 and 2007 were identified through literature searches using Ovid, Medline, PubMed, Web of Science, National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang Data, and VIP China Scientific Journal Database, based on the following key words: leptin, intrauterine growth restriction, intrauterine growth retardation, fetal growth restriction, and small for gestational age., DATA EXTRACTION: A meta-analysis was conducted to analyze the difference of the cord blood leptin concentrations between SGA and AGA newborns. Then the stratified meta-analyses were repeated with a multivariate model to adjust for potential confounders, i.e., samples origin (Chinese newborns vs. non-Chinese newborns), GA (the term-newborns vs. the mixed GA newborns), PIH or CM (the newborns excluding PIH or CM vs. the newborns not excluding PIH or CM)., DATA SYNTHESIS: Twenty articles including 514 SGA newborns and 1006 AGA newborns were collected. The cord leptin concentrations of SGA newborns were lower than those of AGA newborns [WMD (95%CI), -4.42 (-5.54, -3.29) ng/ml; P<0.01; n=1520 newborns]. The results of stratified meta-analyses showed similar results in Chinese vs. non-Chinese newborns and term vs. mixed GA newborns, respectively. However, the newborns not excluding PIH or CM had a wider 95%CI than the newborns excluding PIH or CM [WMD (95%CI), -4.17 (-5.00, -3.33) ng/ml vs. -4.47 (-9.61, 0.67) ng/ml)], and there was no significant difference in cord blood leptin concentrations between SGA and AGA newborns in the newborns not excluding PIH or CM (P=0.09)., CONCLUSIONS: SGA babies have low cord leptin concentrations. Other factors that may influence cord leptin levels are maternal PIH and CM.

AB  - Introduction Maternal plasma adiponectin is inversely related to insulin resistance, atherosclerosis and child health. However, little is known about its concentrations in the perinatal period, especially according to mode of delivery. Our aim is to evaluate the association between mode of delivery and changes in maternal plasma adiponectin from 3rd trimester of pregnancy to 30-45 days postpartum. Methods A cohort was recruited in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with four waves of follow-up: 5-13th, 22-26th, 30-36th gestational weeks and 30-45 days postpartum. Eligible subjects should be between 20-40 years of age, be free of chronic and infectious diseases and presenting with a singleton pregnancy. The mode of delivery was classified as vaginal (VD) or cesarean (CS). Plasma adiponectin concentration (mu g/mL) was measured using commercial ELISA kits. Statistical analyses included the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and the multiple linear mixed effects model. Results A total of 159 participated in the study. Median adiponectin concentrations were higher for the VD group (n = 99; 8.25, IQR: 5.85-11.90) than for the CS group (n = 60; 7.34, IQR: 4.36-9.76; p = 0.040) in the postpartum samples but were not different between the two groups in the 3rd trimester. Women who underwent CS had a lower rate of increase in adiponectin concentration from the 3rd trimester to 30-45 days postpartum compared to those who underwent VD (beta = -.15, 95% CI: -.28-.02, p = 0.030). Conclusion The CS procedure was associated with lower maternal circulating concentrations of adiponectin at 30-45 days postpartum, compared to the VD.

AB  - Antenatal anxiety may increase the risk of undesirable birth outcomes. Studies have demonstrated an association between adiponectin and anxiety, but this issue has not been investigated during pregnancy. This study aimed to evaluate the association between plasma adiponectin, measured throughout gestation, and the occurrence of anxiety at late pregnancy (30-36th weeks). A prospective cohort was investigated in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Healthy pregnant women, aged 20-40 years, were evaluated between gestational weeks 5-13, 22-26 and 30-36. State anxiety was measured using a validated version of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and women were categorized as high (score >= 50, n=30) or low anxiety (score < 50, n=129). Plasma samples for all trimesters were analyzed using commercial ELISA kits to determine adiponectin concentrations (U/mL). Statistical analysis involved student's t-tests, chi-square, Pearson correlation, multiple logistic regression and linear mixed effects (LME) regression to model longitudinal trends of adiponectin, stratified for anxiety categories. Women with higher anxiety scores had lower mean concentrations of 3rd trimester adiponectin compared with those with lower scores (7.9; 95% Cl: 7.0-8.9 vs. 9.9; 95% Cl: 9.1-10.7). Women with 3rd trimester adiponectin values within the third tertile (10.47-26.57 U/mL) were less likely to have high antenatal anxiety (adjusted OR = 0.30; 95% Cl: 0.09-0.98) compared with those within the first tertile (2.25-7.08 U/mL). Unlike women with low levels of anxiety, those with high levels had a significant decrease of plasma adiponectin throughout pregnancy (beta = -0.07; 95% Cl: -0.13 [-0.01] vs.)beta = -0.01; 95% Cl: -0.05 to 0.03). Multiple LME model indicated higher adiponectin throughout pregnancy for women with low anxiety (beta = -1.57; 95% Cl: -2.78 [-0.37]). In conclusion, plasma adiponectin throughout pregnancy was inversely associated with antenatal anxiety. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The main source of orexin secretion in nonpregnant and pregnant women is adipose tissue and placenta, respectively. This research was conducted to evaluate the association between orexin-A level and the mode of delivery, anthropometric indices, and sex of the infant., METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted on 69 normal pregnant women. The samples of umbilical cord blood were obtained at the time of delivery, and maternal blood was taken within 24 h of delivery. Serum orexin-A levels were measured by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS and p < 0.05 was considered as significant., RESULTS: We found a significant difference between postpartum maternal and umbilical cord orexin-A level both with the mode of delivery (p < 0.001). Also, a significant positive correlation was seen between maternal and umbilical cord serum orexin-A levels (r = -0.61, p < 0.001). There was no relationship between serum orexin-A levels with anthropometric indices and the sex of the neonate (p > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Both maternal and umbilical cord serum orexin-A levels were associated with the mode of delivery. Maternal and cord blood orexin-A levels in normal vaginal delivery are higher than cesarean section. Copyright © 2021 Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynecology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of maternal occupational tobacco handling (bidi rolling) on cord serum leptin levels., METHODS: We enrolled 64 neonates born to women who were bidi-rollers, and 64 small for gestational age (SGA) neonates and 57 term appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates born to mothers with no tobacco exposure. Cord blood leptin levels between the groups were compared. Adjusted mean difference in leptin was calculated using regression model., RESULTS: Cord leptin showed moderate correlation with birthweight (r=0.16; P=0.027) across the groups. Mean (SD) cord serum leptin levels (ng/mL) of study group was 19.79 (13.32), in comparison to 21.4 (13.4) of SGA (P=0.497), and 27.70 (13.96) of term AGA (P=0.002). Maternal occupational tobacco exposure contributed to significant decrease in cord leptin (adjusted mean difference (95%CI): -4.5 ng/mL (-8.82, -0.19); P=0.041)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal occupational tobacco exposure causes signifi-cant reduction in fetal leptin levels.

AB  - Fetal growth is a complex process which depends both on the genetic makeup and intrauterine environment. Maternal nutrition during pregnancy is an important determinant of fetal growth. Adequate nutrient supply is required during pregnancy and lactation for the support of fetal/infant growth and development. Macro- and micronutrients are both important to sustain pregnancy and for appropriate growth of the fetus. While macronutrients provide energy and proteins for fetal growth, micronutrients play a major role in the metabolism of macronutrients, structural and cellular metabolism of the fetus. Discrepancies in maternal diet at different stages of foetal growth / offspring development can have pronounced influences on the health and well-being of the offspring. Indeed intrauterine growth restriction induced by nutrient insult can irreversibly modulate the endocrine/metabolic status of the fetus that leads to the development of adiposity and insulin resistance in its later life. Understanding the role of micronutrients during the development of fetus will provide insights into the probable underlying / associated mechanisms in the metabolic pathways of endocrine related complications. Keeping in view the modernized lifestyle and food habits that lead to the development of adiposity and world burden of obesity, this review focuses mainly on the role of maternal micronutrients in the foetal origins of adiposity.

AB  - Runt piglets were used as a model for neonatal stress to test the hypothesis that stress during the pre-weaning period can alter adipokine gene transcription levels. Runts were selected by birth mass <1 kg and compared to littermates (controls) of mean litter weight Subcutaneous (SQ) and perirenal (PR) adipose tissues were collected at d1 (n = 5), V (n = 7) or d21 (n = 9) of age. Real time PCR was used to quantify mRNA abundance for: leptin, adiponectin, interleukin 1 beta (IL1 beta), IL6, IL8, IL10, IL15, tumor necrosis factor alpha, haptoglobin, macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), monocyte chemotactic protein, vascular endothelial growth factor and cyclophilin. Leptin and adiponectin mRNA abundance were lower,while IL1 beta, IL6, IL10 and MIF m RNA abundance were higher in SQ of runts than controls at d1 (P<0.05). Leptin, IL6, IL10, haptoglobin and MIF mRNA abundance were higher in PR from runts than controls at d7 (P<0.05) and MIF mRNA abundance was elevated by 30 fold in PR of runts at d21 (P<0.001). Thus, stressors affecting neonatal runts produce different responses in adipokine gene transcription by PR and SQ than in normal sized littermates. (C) Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Introduction The prevalence of childhood obesity has risen dramatically in recent years. A proportion of this burden has been attributed to factors that occur during the first 1000 days of life such as genetic predisposition, breast feeding and complementary feeding. Although the mechanisms by which these factors affect weight and adiposity are less well understood, appetite and satiety regulation may be a key to understanding them. This cohort study aims to investigate the role of appetite and satiety regulation as a mediator in the association between infant feeding practices and genetic polymorphisms with children's growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. Methods and analysis 'MAS-Lactancia' (the first word means 'more' and is also an acronym in Spanish for 'Appetite and Satiety Mechanisms', the second word is 'breastfeeding') is an open, ongoing, prospective birth cohort that began the enrolment in 2016 of mother-child pairs affiliated to the Mexican Social Security Institute and that live in the city of Cuernavaca, Mexico. Pregnant women between 16-week and 22-week gestation are followed during the second half of their pregnancies, at birth and throughout their infant's first 48 months of life (at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 36 months and 48 months) at the clinic and at-home visits that include questionnaires, anthropometric measurements and biospecimen collection. The main exposure variables are infant feeding (breast feeding and complementary feeding) and genetic polymorphisms (fat mass and obesity-associated, leptin and adiponectin genes). Outcome variables include infant's growth, adiposity and metabolic risk factors. We will conduct longitudinal models and path analyses to identify the potential mediating role of satiety and appetite indicators (leptin, adiponectin, insulin concentrations, appetite and satiety perception). Ethics and dissemination The study protocol, data collection instruments, consent forms and procedures were approved by the institutional review boards of the National Institute of Public Health and the Mexican Social Security Institute in Mexico. Findings will be disseminated through conferences, peer-reviewed publications and meetings with stakeholders.

AB  - Understanding the developmental origins of health and disease is integral to overcome the global tide of obesity and its metabolic consequences, including atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. The rising prevalence of obesity has been attributed, in part, to environmental factors including the globalization of the western diet and unhealthy lifestyle choices. In this review we argue that how and when such exposures come into play from conception significantly impact overall risk of obesity and later health outcomes. While the laws of thermodynamics dictate that obesity is caused by an imbalance between caloric intake and energy expenditure, the drivers of each of these may be laid down before the manifestation of the phenotype. We present evidence over the last half-century that suggests that the temporospatial evolution of obesity from intrauterine life and beyond is, in part, due to the conditioning of physiological processes at critical developmental periods that results in maladaptive responses to obesogenic exposures later in life. We begin the review by introducing studies that describe an association between perinatal factors and later risk of obesity. After a brief discussion of the pathogenesis of obesity, including the systemic regulation of appetite, adiposity, and basal metabolic rate, we delve into the mechanics of how intrauterine, postnatal and early childhood metabolic environments may contribute to adult obesity risk through the process of metabolic conditioning. Finally, we detail the specific epigenetic pathways identified both in preclinical and clinical studies that synergistically "program" obesity.Copyright © 2022 Rajamoorthi, LeDuc and Thaker.

AB  - Background Fetal exposure to maternal excess adiposity and hyperglycemia is risk factors for childhood adverse metabolic outcomes. Using data from a prospective pre-birth cohort, we aimed to further understand the prenatal determinants of fetal metabolic programming based on analyses of maternal adiposity and glycemic traits across pregnancy with childhood metabolomic profiles. Methods This study included 330 mother-child pairs from the Gen3G cohort with information on maternal adiposity and glycemic markers at 5-16 (visit 1) and 24-30 (visit 2) weeks of pregnancy. At mid-childhood (4.8-7.2 years old), we collected fasting plasma and measured 1116 metabolites using an untargeted approach. We constructed networks of interconnected metabolites using a weighted-correlation network analysis algorithm. We estimated Spearman's partial correlation coefficients of maternal adiposity and glycemic traits across pregnancy with metabolite networks and individual metabolites, adjusting for maternal age, gravidity, race/ethnicity, history of smoking, and child's sex and age at blood collection for metabolite measurement. Results We identified a network of 16 metabolites, primarily glycero-3-phosphoethanolamines (GPE) at mid-childhood that showed consistent negative correlations with maternal body mass index, waist circumference, and body-fat percentage at visits 1 and 2 (rho(adjusted) = -0.14 to -0.21) and post-challenge glucose levels at visit 2 (rho(adjusted) = -0.10 to -0.13), while positive correlations with Matsuda index (rho(adjusted) = 0.13). Within this identified network, 1-palmitoyl-2-decosahexaenoyl-GPE and 1-stearoyl-2-decosahexaenoyl-GPE appeared to be driving the associations. In addition, a network of 89 metabolites, primarily phosphatidylcholines, plasmalogens, sphingomyelins, and ceramides showed consistent negative correlations with insulin at visit 1 and post-challenge glucose at visit 2, while positive correlation with adiponectin at visit 2. Conclusions Prenatal exposure to maternal higher adiposity and hyperglycemic traits and lower insulin sensitivity markers were associated with a unique metabolomic pattern characterized by low serum phospho- and sphingolipids in mid-childhood.

AB  - Obesity, overweight and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are problems of global importance which are of great relevance to India. Abundant epidemiological evidence implicates maternal undernutrition (widespread in India) in their aetiology. Indeed it is hypothesized that maternal undernutrition programs the foetus/neonate for increased adiposity which predisposes them to insulin resistance (IR) and T2DM in adulthood. Importance of maternal macronutrient but not of micronutrient (MN) deficiencies is well established in developmental programming. Considering the epidemic proportion of Diabesity among Indians in whom low birth weight and MN deficiencies continue to be rampant, we assessed the effects of maternal MN deficiency on body composition, IR and macronutrient metabolism in rat models. Regardless of the type of MN , maternal deficiency of a variety of MNs throughout their growth, pregnancy, lactation and thereafter in the offspring, modulated body composition of the offspring: increased body fat % (visceral fat), altered adipokine levels and fatty acid synthesis/transport which resulted in dyslipidemia. They reduced soft tissue (muscle) mass as suggested by decreased % of lean body and fat free mass (supported by decreased myogenesis) and also modulated glucose uptake by muscle, an insulin responsive tissue. The offspring had altered glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity perhaps due to altered insulin expression and/or secretion. Altered oxidative/corticosteroid stress appeared to be associated with the similar phenotypic changes observed in the offspring born to different MN restricted rat dams. Interestingly, maternal vitamin restriction induced changes appeared to be preventable/reversible by rehabilitation, while only changes in the associated biochemical/molecular mechanism(s) (but not the changes in the phenotype) induced by maternal mineral restriction were reversible, albeit partly. It was of further interest that maternal folate and/or vit B12 restriction induced changes in F1 offspring were also observed in F2 generation. These changes, which essentially are adaptations to overcome adverse conditions in utero/early postnatal life, appear to become maladaptive subsequently and set the stage for obesity, IR and type 2 diabetes in their later life.

AB  - Emerging research suggests that adiponectin, a cytokine produced by adipose tissue, may be implicated in ASD. In this prospective birth cohort study (n = 847), we assessed the association between cord, early childhood plasma adiponectin and the risk of developing ASD. ASD was defined based on ICD codes of physician diagnosis. Cord adiponectin levels were inversely associated with ASD risk (aOR 0.50; 95% CI 0.33, 0.77), independent of preterm birth, early childhood adiponectin and other known ASD risk factors. Early childhood adiponectin, assessed prior to ASD diagnosis, was associated with lower risk of ASD, which attenuated after adjusting for cord adiponectin, indicating the relative importance of cord adiponectin in ASD risk. Further research is warranted to confirm our findings and elucidate biological mechanisms.

AB  - Leptin is a proinflammatory cytokine that plays an important role in energy homeostasis. Emerging evidence suggests that leptin levels are altered in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD); however, this has not been studied prospectively. Rapid growth during infancy and early childhood has been implicated in ASD, but the evidence is inconsistent. As leptin is involved in growth and is a potential risk factor for ASD, we explored the associations between (a) cord, early childhood leptin and ASD; and (b) birth weight for gestational age, early childhood weight gain, and ASD. We also assessed the mediating role of leptin in the relationship between weight gain during infancy and ASD. This study was conducted in a sample of 822 subjects from the Boston Birth Cohort. ASD was defined from diagnostic codes in electronic medical records. Extremely rapid weight gain during infancy was associated with a greater ASD risk and this persisted after adjusting for potential confounders (aOR: 3.11; 95% CI: 1.37, 7.07). Similarly, children that had higher plasma leptin levels, prior to ASD diagnosis, had an increased ASD risk in both unadjusted and adjusted models (aOR: 7.87; 95% CI: 2.06, 30.04). Further, early childhood leptin indirectly mediated the relationship between rapid weight gain and ASD. No associations were found between birth weight for gestational age, cord leptin and risk of ASD. Our findings provide a basis to further explore whether the combination of early life growth pattern and a biomarker such as leptin can predict ASD earlier. Autism Res 2018, 11: 1416-1431. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Is early life growth and a biomarker leptin related to ASD risk? To answer this question, we followed 822 children from birth and found that those who gained weight very quickly in infancy, had higher leptin levels in early childhood, had a greater chance of later ASD diagnosis. More research is needed to see if infant's weight gain pattern along with a biomarker (such as leptin) can be used to identify children with ASD sooner.

AB  - Hypoxia is a common neonatal stress that induces insulin resistance and a decrease in body weight gain. Dexamethasone is often used to treat neonatal cardiopulmonary disease, and also leads to insulin resistance and a decrease in body weight gain. The current study addressed the hypothesis that serum concentrations of the adipokines adiponectin and/or resistin are altered during hypoxia and/or dexamethasone therapy in neonatal rats. Rat pups with their lactating dams were exposed to hypoxia (11% O-2) from birth and treated with a tapering regimen of dexamethasone from postnatal day (PD) 3-6. Serum adiponectin and resistin were measured on PD7. Hypoxia and dexamethasone independently decreased body weight gain and increased adiponectin levels. The combination of hypoxia and dexamethasone did not further increase adiponectin. Dexamethasone caused a small increase in resistin in normoxic pups, which may facilitate the hyperinsulemic-normoglycemic state we previously described. We also conclude that adiponectin is increased during hypoxia in response to a decrease in the sensitivity to insulin.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Visfatin is an adipokine produced and secreted by the adipose tissue. It exerts an insulin-like effect by the insulin receptor-1 and has a hypoglycemic effect. We aimed to investigate how serum visfatin changes in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and whether it is predictive of neonatal outcomes., METHODS: Visfatin levels were prospectively measured in peripheral blood serum by enzyme immunoassay in 210 pregnant women, 156 of which were diagnosed with GDM, 18 of which suffered from pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) and 36 healthy controls., RESULTS: Patients with obesity class II (median=2.562 ng/mL) and class III (median=6.2940 ng/mL) had higher serum visfatin than overweight patients (median=0.735 ng/mL); (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.037 and P=0.023, respectively). In GDM patients with BMI above 30, serum visfatin was associated to glycosylated hemoglobin (Spearman correlation test, R=0.26, P=0.045). Women with BMI above 25 treated with insulin had lower serum visfatin levels than those treated with diet only (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.045). No correlation was found between visfatin and parameters of lipid profile such as HDL, LDL, or triglycerides (Spearman correlation tests, R=-0.051, -0.1, 0.0019; P=0.54, 0.29, 0.98, respectively). We observed that visfatin was not associated with birth weight (Spearman correlation test, R=-0.014, P=0.86) or adverse neonatal outcome as measured by umbilical artery pH below 7.25 (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.55) or Apgar score below 10 (Mann-Whitney U test, P=0.21)., CONCLUSIONS: In GDM patients with higher BMI, serum visfatin was elevated, correlated positively with glycosylated hemoglobin, and decreased upon treatment with insulin therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the correlation of fetal and maternal plasma leptin concentrations during the second half of uncomplicated, euploid pregnancies and to compare these values with those obtained from pregnancies with Down syndrome., METHODS: Paired maternal venous and fetal umbilical blood samples were obtained during cordocentesis in 36 uncomplicated, euploid pregnancies and nine pregnancies with Down syndrome fetuses. Concentrations of leptin were measured by sensitive radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: Among pregnancies with euploid fetuses, there was significant correlation between both fetal and maternal leptin levels and gestational age (r = 0.464, p = 0.005 and r = 0.629, p < 0.001, respectively). Fetal plasma leptin concentrations also correlated with maternal levels (r = 0.485, p = 0.003), but fetal levels were significantly lower than maternal values (mean 2.12 +/- 0.44 ng/ml vs. 17.79 +/- 5.48 ng/ml, respectively; p < 0.001). Down syndrome fetuses had significantly lower fetal plasma leptin levels than gestational age-matched control euploid fetuses (0.72 + 0.54 ng/ml vs. 2.12 + 0.44 ng/ml; p < 0.002). However, there was no difference in maternal leptin concentrations between euploid and Down syndrome pregnancies., CONCLUSION: In euploid pregnancies, fetal leptin levels were significantly lower than the corresponding maternal values but increased across gestation. Down syndrome was associated with significantly lower fetal leptin levels.

AB  - Fetal overgrowth and higher adiposity are hallmarks of pregnancy with maternal obesity and poor glucose tolerance, two conditions associated with decreased maternal insulin sensitivity. In non-pregnant individuals, adipokines, vasoactive peptides, and components of the immune system crosstalk with metabolic factors to generate signals triggering obesity and impaired insulin action. We have investigated circulating maternal and fetal cytokines and growth-factors as potential biochemical markers of fetal adiposity. Mothers and neonates were classified into three tertiles (T1-T3) using total neonatal fat mass as the outcome with 309 +/- 25 g in T1, 478 +/- 40 g in T2, and 529 +/- 39 g in T3. Umbilical cord endothelin-1 (ET-1), C-peptide, and leptin were higher in T3 and T2 versus T1. Only cord leptin was strongly associated with fetal fat mass (P < .01), whereas neonatal lean body mass was negatively correlated with maternal insulin-like growth factor binding protein-I (IGFBP-I) (r = -0.53, P < .04). This study shows an association between increased fetal adiposity and maternal systemic interleukin-6 (IL-6). No such correlation was found with factors circulating in cord blood, suggesting that the stimuli favoring fetal fat accretion derive from maternal or placental sources rather than from the fetus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study aimed to determine the effect of perceived stress during pregnancy on neonatal outcomes and cortisol and leptin levels in mothers and their newborns., METHODS: This longitudinal study was carried out on 110 pregnant women in Miandoab city, Iran. Mothers, who had singleton pregnancies and gestational age of 24 to 28 weeks, were included in the study. The participants were asked to fill out Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS). The mothers were then tracked in gestational ages of 28-32 weeks, 32-36 weeks, and the time of delivery. The maternal and umbilical cord blood samples were obtained during labor in order to measure leptin and cortisol levels., RESULTS: Umbilical cortisol level was significantly higher in newborns who had meconium stained amniotic fluid than those who did not. Maternal blood leptin levels at delivery were significantly higher in the mothers whose neonates had respiratory distress, low birth weight, low head circumference, low Apgar score, and were premature than those whose neonates did not have such problems. The level of leptin in umbilical cord blood was significantly higher in neonates who had respiratory distress than those who did not. The results also showed a significant correlation between maternal cortisol levels and PSS during weeks 24-28 and the entire pregnancy. A significant relationship was observed between umbilical leptin and maternal leptin levels., CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that stress during pregnancy is accompanied by fetal distress. The probable reason for newborns distress may be related to increased maternal leptin levels.

AB  - The obesity is the nutrition disturbance more common in developed countries, where it substituted the calorie malnutrition. The effects of calorie malnutrition on immunity were widely studied for many years and it is well known that contributes to different types of immunodeficiency, enhancing infections and parasitosis. The obesity also impairs the immunity although its effects are less known. Some molecules (adipokines) synthesized in fat tissue participate in inflammation and their plasma levels are modified in obese subjects. Moreover, obesity could increase or disturb the evolution of inflammatory process, including pregnancy, fetal growth or labor. Most available information has been obtained from animal research; nevertheless there are already important data from human clinics suggesting a worse follow-up of chronic inflammation, such as asthma, when it is associated to obesity.

AB  - This study investigated the roles of adiponectin in IVF treatment during Phase I (the basal stage before gonadotropin administration), Phase II (approximately 8 days after gonadotropin administration), and Phase III (on the ovum pick-up day), as well as the effects of adiponectin on CYP19A1 and the FSH receptor (FSHR) mRNA expression in a human granulosa-like tumor cell line (KGN). In human subjects (a longitudinal study, n = 30), blood samples were collected in all phases, while follicular fluid (FF) was only collected in Phase III. The participants were classified into successful and unsuccessful groups based on the determination of fetal heartbeats. KGN cells were treated with adiponectin/FSH/IGF-1 (an experimental study, n = 3). There was no difference in the adiponectin levels between successful and unsuccessful pregnancies in the FF (Phase III) and in serum (all phases), as well as among the three phases in both groups. Serum FSH (Phase I) was positively associated with serum adiponectin in the unsuccessful group, but it had a negative association in the successful group (all phases). Serum adiponectin and serum FSH (Phase I) were positively correlated in the unsuccessful group, whereas they were negatively correlated (all phases) in the successful group. The serum adiponectin levels (Phase III) were significantly higher than in the FF in unsuccessful pregnancies, but there was no difference in successful pregnancies. FF adiponectin concentrations were negatively correlated with serum LH in successful subjects. In KGN cells, adiponectin had no influence on CYP19A1 and FSHR mRNA expression. High adiponectin levels in serum compared to FF (Phase III) in unsuccessful subjects might negatively impact IVF treatment.

AB  - Simple Summary This review critically examined the literature on the interaction between insulin resistance (IR) and metabolic inflammation in transition dairy cows. Our review emphasizes how IR and metabolic inflammation mutually influence each other, leading to heightened lipolysis, immune activation, and tissue inflammatory pathways. These processes contribute to a harmful cycle where inflammatory mediators exacerbate IR and metabolic inflammation. While transient IR and metabolic inflammation are natural adaptations in transitioning cows, this review highlights the increased disease risk in over-conditioned cows. Understanding these interactions is crucial for managing metabolic disorders in dairy herds and promoting animal health, welfare, and productivity.Abstract During the transition period, dairy cows exhibit heightened energy requirements to sustain fetal growth and lactogenesis. The mammary gland and the growing fetus increase their demand for glucose, leading to the mobilization of lipids to support the function of tissues that can use fatty acids as energy substrates. These physiological adaptations lead to negative energy balance, metabolic inflammation, and transient insulin resistance (IR), processes that are part of the normal homeorhetic adaptations related to parturition and subsequent lactation. Insulin resistance is characterized by a reduced biological response of insulin-sensitive tissues to normal physiological concentrations of insulin. Metabolic inflammation is characterized by a chronic, low-level inflammatory state that is strongly associated with metabolic disorders. The relationship between IR and metabolic inflammation in transitioning cows is intricate and mutually influential. On one hand, IR may play a role in the initiation of metabolic inflammation by promoting lipolysis in adipose tissue and increasing the release of free fatty acids. Metabolic inflammation, conversely, triggers inflammatory signaling pathways by pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby leading to impaired insulin signaling. The interaction of these factors results in a harmful cycle in which IR and metabolic inflammation mutually reinforce each other. This article offers a comprehensive review of recent advancements in the research on IR, metabolic inflammation, and their intricate interrelationship. The text delves into multiple facets of physiological regulation, pathogenesis, and their consequent impacts.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The main objective of this study was to investigate whether maternal adiponectin regulates fetal growth through the endocrine system in the fetal compartment., METHODS: Adiponectin knockout (Adipoq (-/-) ) mice and in vivo adenovirus-mediated reconstitution were used to study the regulatory effect of maternal adiponectin on fetal growth. Primary human trophoblast cells were treated with adiponectin and a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) agonist or antagonist to study the underlying mechanism through which adiponectin regulates fetal growth., RESULTS: The body weight of fetuses from Adipoq (-/-) dams was significantly greater than that of wild-type dams at both embryonic day (E)14.5 and E18.5. Adenoviral vector-mediated maternal adiponectin reconstitution attenuated the increased fetal body weight induced by maternal adiponectin deficiency. Significantly increased blood glucose, triacylglycerol and NEFA levels were observed in Adipoq (-/-) dams, suggesting that nutrient supply contributes to maternal adiponectin-regulated fetal growth. Although fetal blood IGF-1 concentrations were comparable in fetuses from Adipoq (-/-) and wild-type dams, remarkably low levels of IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP-1) were observed in the serum of fetuses from Adipoq (-/-) dams. IGFBP-1 was identified in the trophoblast cells of human and mouse placentas. Maternal fasting robustly increased IGFBP-1 levels in mouse placentas, while reducing fetal weight. Significantly low IGFBP-1 levels were found in placentas of Adipoq (-/-) dams. Adiponectin treatment increased IGFBP-1 levels in primary cultured human trophoblast cells, while the PPARalpha antagonist, MK886, abolished this stimulatory effect., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that, in addition to nutrient supply, maternal adiponectin inhibits fetal growth by increasing IGFBP-1 expression in trophoblast cells.

AB  - Maternal obesity increases offspring birth weight and susceptibility to obesity. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone with a prominent function in maintaining energy homeostasis. In contrast to adults, neonatal blood adiponectin levels are positively correlated with anthropometric parameters of adiposity. This study was designed to investigate the role of adiponectin in maternal obesity-enhanced fetal fat deposition. By using high-fat diet-induced obese mouse models, our study showed that maternal obesity increased fetal fat tissue mass, with a significant elevation in fetal blood adiponectin. However, adiponectin gene knockout (Adipoq(-/-)) attenuated maternal obesity-induced high fetal fat tissue mass. We further studied the effects of fetal adiponectin on fetal fat deposition by using a cross breeding approach to create Adipoq(-/+) and Adipoq(-/-) offspring, whereas maternal adiponectin was null. Adipoq(-/+) offspring had more fat tissue mass at both birth and adulthood. Significantly high levels of lipogenic genes, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c and fatty acid synthase, were detected in the livers of Adipoq(-/+) fetuses. In addition, expression of genes for placental fatty acid transport was significantly increased in Adipoq(-/+) fetuses. Together, our study indicates that adiponectin enhances fetal fat deposition and plays an important role in maternal obesity-induced high birth weight. Diabetes 61:3199-3207, 2012

AB  - Since the introduction of the thrifty phenotype hypothesis, the potential traits of thrift have been described in increasingly broad terms but biochemical and behavioral evidence of thrift has not been well demonstrated. The objective of our studies was to use a rodent model to identify features of thrift programmed by early life protein restriction. Robust programming of thrifty features requires a thrifty nutritional environment during the entire window of developmental plasticity. Therefore, pregnant rats were exposed to a low protein diet throughout the window of developmental plasticity spanning the period of gestation and lactation and its effects on energy acquisition, storage and expenditure in the adult offspring were examined. Maternal protein restriction reduced birth weight and produced long term reductions in body and organ weights in the offspring. Low protein offspring demonstrated an increased drive to seek food as evidenced by hyperphagia that was mediated by changes in plasma leptin and ghrelin levels. Hyperphagia was accompanied by increased efficiency in converting caloric intake into body mass. The higher feed efficiency was mediated by greater insulin sensitivity. Energy expenditure of low protein offspring in locomotion was not affected either in the light or dark phase. However, low protein offspring exhibited higher resting and basal metabolic rates as evidenced by higher core body temperature in the fed and fasted states. The increased thermogenesis was not mediated by thyroid hormones but by an increased sympathetic nervous system drive as reflected by a lower areal bone mineral density and bone mineral content and lower plasma adiponectin and triglyceride levels. Elevated thermogenesis in the low protein offspring possibly offsets the effects of hyperphagia, minimizes their chances of weight gain, and improves survivability. This constellation of metabolic features in the low protein offspring will maximize survival potential in a post natal environment of nutritional scarcity and constitute a thrifty phenotype.

AB  - The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents has been increasing worldwide. As in adults, childhood obesity is closely related to hypertension, dyslipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance (IR) syndrome. Moreover, obese children have been found to be at increased risk of becoming obese adults. Obese children and adolescents tend to develop serious medical and psychosocial complications and also are at greater risk morbidity and mortality in adulthood. The molecular basis of the pathogenesis of obesity-linked disorders has not been fully elucidated. Adipose tissue serves not only as an energy storage organ, but also as an endocrine organ. It releases many factors with autocrine, paracrine and endocrine functions. Adipokines such as leptin, resistin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, adipsin, visfatin, and adiponectin are biologically active molecules produced by adipose tissue. They play a role in energy homeostasis, and in glucose and lipid metabolism. Adiponectin level, unlike that of other adipocytokines, is decreased in obesity and increased after weight reduction. Adiponectin has been associated with both central obesity and increased visceral adipose tissue and it has anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, and potent insulin-sensitizing (anti-diabetic) effects.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to assess glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity in young adults born small for gestational age (SGA) as well as to measure the body composition and adipocytokines of these subjects., METHODS: A total of 108 out of 342 SGA-born participants were invited for reexamination from the former Bavarian Longitudinal Study (BLS), in which 7505 risk-newborns of the years 1985 to 1986 were prospectively followed. Of these, 76 (34 female/42 male) participants at the age of 19.7+/-0.5 years were enrolled. Clinical examination and oral glucose tolerance testing (oGTT) was performed with assessment of insulin resistance indices, HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), adipocytokines, and body composition by bioimpedance analysis (BIA)., RESULTS: A total of 25 out of 76 (32.9%) patients had abnormal fasting and/or glucose-stimulated insulin levels. Glucose values measured during oGTT showed no abnormalities, except one participant who had impaired glucose tolerance. Homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) was 1.92+/-4.2, and insulin sensitivity index by Matsuda (ISI(Matsuda)) showed mean values of 7.85+/-4.49. HOMA-IR>2.5 was found in 8 patients (10.5%), and 20 patients (26.3%) had an ISI(Matsuda)<5, both interpreted as insulin resistant. No alterations of adipocytokines were found. Fat mass (FM) measured by BIA was within the normal range for both genders and correlated significantly with BMI (r=0.465, p<0.001) and leptin (r=0.668, p>0.001), but not with adiponectin. Insulin resistance correlated with change in weight-for-height Z-score during the first 3 months of age, indicating that weight gain during that early phase might be a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance in children born SGA., CONCLUSIONS: A high percentage of insulin-resistant subjects were reconfirmed in a large German cohort of young adults born SGA. Therefore, regular screening for disturbances in glucose metabolism is recommended in these subjects.

AB  - AIM: to investigate the effect of low birth weight (LBW) on endothelial function, and to determine the role of plasma adiponectin in endothelial dysfunction by conducting flow mediated brachial artery (FMBA) test or vasodilation response (VR) and by measuring plasma asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) of young adults born with LBW., METHODS: in a retrospective cohort study, subjects were randomly selected from the growth study cohort of Tanjungsari Sumedang district West Java. They consisted of 67 LBW and 67 NBW (Normal Birth Weight) young adults. Dependent variables were plasma adiponectin, plasma ADMA, and VR. The correlation between plasma adiponectin and ADMA level was examined using Pearson's correlation., RESULTS: the relative risk for LBW to have low brachialis artery vasodilation response was 2.94, (95% CI:1.91-4.53), and to have low of plasma adiponectin concentration 1.53, (95% CI: 1.07-2.18). There was a statistically significant difference for all variables studied (FMBA, plasma ADMA, and plasma Adiponectin concentrations), while simultaneous confidence interval measurements indicated that the value of FMBA and the concentration of plasma adiponectin were significantly lower, respectively p<0.001, 95% CI: -4.409-(-2.114), and p=0.015, 95% CI: -1.083-(-0.082) in LBW compared to NBW subjects. The correlation between plasma adiponectin concentration and plasma ADMA concentration in LBW subjects was not significant., CONCLUSION: there is an effect of LBW on endothelial function. LBW compared to NBW subjects have lower VR and plasma adiponectin concentration. There may be a small role of plasma adiponectin in endothelial dysfunction of young adults with LBW.

AB  - Beside an anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammation effect, and a sensitizer insulin, adiponectin also play an important role in fetal growth. Hypoadiponectinemia may lead to endothelial dysfunction. Low birth weight (LBW) has increase risk of cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study was to analyze the differences of plasma adiponectin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) level and vasodilatation response of brachial artery by doing flow mediated brachial artery (FMBA) test between young adults with LBW and normal birth weight (NBW), and the role of adiponectin level in endothelial function of the LBW. This was a retrospective cohort study during November 2009-January 2010, 134 subjects were randomly selected from the Growth Study Cohort of Tanjungsari Sumedang. They consisted of 67 LBW and 67 NBW young adults, with similar basic characteristics. A multivariate analysis via Hotelling's trace showed that there was a significant difference (p<0.001) for FMBA, ADMA, and adiponectin level, but simultaneous confidence interval measurements indicated that the rate of FMBA and the level of plasma adiponectin were significantly lower (p<0.001, p=0.015, respectively) in LBW compared to NBW. The correlation between adiponectin and ADMA level (r=-0.16, p=0.176), and FMBA (r=0.13, p=0.281) in LBW were not significant, suggesting a small role of plasma adiponectin in endothelial dysfunction of young adults with LBW, other variables could play a role such as tumor necrosis factor a. In conclusions, the level of plasma adiponectin and FMBA are different between LBW and NBW, but the role of adiponectin may be small in endothelial dysfunction in young adults with LBW.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The effects of free fatty acids (FFA), leptin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha and body fat distribution on in vivo oxidation of a glucose load were studied in two South African ethnic groups., DESIGN AND MEASUREMENTS: Anthropometric and various metabolic indices were measured at fasting and during a 7 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Body composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis and subcutaneous and visceral fat mass was assessed using a five- and two-level CT-scan respectively. Glucose oxidation was evaluated by measuring the ratio of (13)CO(2) to (12)CO(2) in breath following ingestion of 1-(13)C-labelled glucose., SUBJECTS: Ten lean black women (LBW), ten obese black women (OBW), nine lean white women (LWW) and nine obese white women (OWW) were investigated after an overnight fast., RESULTS: Visceral fat levels were significantly higher (P<0.01) in obese white than black women, despite similar body mass indexes (BMIs). There were no ethnic differences in glucose oxidation however; in the lean subjects of both ethnic groups the area under the curve (AUC) was higher than in obese subjects (P<0.05 for both) and was found to correlate negatively with weight (r=-0.69, P<0.01) after correcting for age. Basal TNF alpha concentrations were similar in all groups. Percentage suppression of FFAs at 30 min of the OGTT was 24+/-12% in OWW and -38+/-23% (P<0.05) in OBW, ie the 30 min FFA level was higher than the fasting level in the latter group. AUC for FFAs during the late postprandial period (120--420 min) was significantly higher in OWW than OBW (P<0.01) and LWW (P<0.01) and correlated positively with visceral fat mass independent of age (r=0.78, P<0.05) in the OWW only. Leptin levels were higher (P<0.01) both at fasting and during the course of the OGTT in obese women from both ethnic groups compared to the lean women., CONCLUSIONS: Glucose oxidation is reduced in obese subjects of both ethnic groups; inter- and intra-ethnic differences were observed in visceral fat mass and FFA production and it is possible that such differences may play a role in the differing prevalences of obesity-related disorders that have been reported in these two populations.

AB  - Serum leptin levels reflect body fat mass (FM), and have been described to be related to serum uric acid levels in adult type 2 diabetic and healthy subjects. We therefore aimed to evaluate the interrelationship between leptin and markers of the metabolic syndrome by studying serum leptin concentration, body mass index (BMI), percent body fat (Fat%), total fat mass (FM), sum of skinfolds (SS), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (CHOL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), glucose, insulin, calculated insulin resistance (HOMA), creatinine (CR), and uric acid (UA) concentration in 50 former small-for-gestational-age (SGA) children and 21 infants born adequate for gestational age (AGA) at the time of mid-puberty. Our data confirm previous results showing a positive association between leptin and body fatness, and female gender. Twelve children with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) had higher UA levels than subjects with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) (5.1 +/- 1.1 v 4.2 +/- 1.2 mg/dL, P <.05), and showed the strongest relation between serum leptin and UA (r =.76, P <.001). Multiple regression analyses demonstrated that gender, estimates of total body adiposity (Fat% and SS), birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA), stimulated glucose and insulin, and serum UA are independently associated with serum leptin concentration in former SGA children with dysglycemia (R(2) =.89, P <.001). A long-term effect of intrauterine growth restriction on body fatness, metabolic syndrome, and serum leptin levels is suggested. Copyright 2001 by W.B. Saunders Company

AB  - In recent years, a number of the studies of myokine irisin in adults and isolated in newborns have been carried out. The role of adipocytokines in the growth and development of the fetus and children has been shown. The aim of the study was to assess the levels of myokine irisin and adipocytokines in newborns small for gestational age at birth and to analyze the relationship between the parameters of the hormonal status of children and their mothers. 49 newborns and their mothers were examined. Two groups were identified: group 1 (Gr1) - newborns small for gestational age (n = 24), group 2 (Gr2) - newborns appropriate for gestational age (n = 25). The levels of irisin and adipocytokines in the blood serum were determined by the enzyme immunoassay. Newborns small for gestational age had significantly lower levels of leptin and IGF-1 in the umbilical cord blood compared to children with physical development corresponding to the gestational age. There were no significant differences in the irisin content of cord blood serum in newborn Gr1 compared with Gr2. The presence of significant positive correlations between the level of irisin in the umbilical cord blood of newborns small for gestational age and the body weight at birth was established. In Gr1, a positive relationship was found between the irisin levels of mothers and newborns (r = 0.518, p = 0.028). The differences in the irisin content between the groups were established, taking into account the delivery mode (p = 0.0104). The revealed statistically significant differences in the concentrations of the analyzed metabolic markers in mother-child pairs, their relationship with clinical and anthropometric parameters substantiate the possibility of using irisin and adipocytokines as predictors in predicting the formation of metabolic disorders of infants small for gestational age.Copyright © 2021 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of Belarus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Kisspeptin (KP) is a major regulator of reproductive functions. It has also been shown to be involved in the metabolic changes associated with obesity. According to the well-established concept of prenatal programming, environmental factors can influence physiological and behavioral systems at the early stages of development. Thus, we hypothesized that in pregnant women, obesity can be associated with alterations in the levels of KP. We also assumed that the observed changes in obese mothers' blood (MB) would be reflected in the umbilical cord blood (CB)., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We collected MB and CB from obese and nonobese women and analyzed the differences in metabolic and hormonal profiles, including KP concentration, using commercially available assays., RESULTS: We found that the level of KP was increased in the MB and CB of obese patients compared to nonobese subjects (p<0.05). A strong correlation was observed between the concentration of KP in MB and CB (r=0.8343; p<0.01). Moreover, we detected that the differences in the adipokine profile observed in the MB were not reflected in CB., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that blood KP concentration can serve as a valuable marker in pregnant women. However, further studies are needed to understand the alterations of this peptide in obese pregnant woman and their potential effects on offspring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nutrition and growth in early postnatal life have a role in future diseases. Our aim was to investigate adiponectin oligomers in adequate-for-gestational-age obese children with respect to type and duration of feeding in the first year of life. METHODS: Adiponectin oligomers and cardiometabolic risk factors were measured in 113 adequate-for-gestational-age obese children, divided into group A (prolonged breast feeding, >6 mo), group B (short breast feeding, 1-6 mo), and group C (formula feeding from birth). RESULTS: All the parameters were similar among the groups. Adiponectin oligomers did not correlate with gestational age, months of breast feeding, and time of weaning. Total and high-molecular weight adiponectin were differently distributed across gender and pubertal stages (P < 0.02), being lower in males from the start of puberty. Prepregnancy BMI and at the end of the pregnancy were negatively associated (P < 0.04) with total and medium-molecular weight adiponectin in female and male offspring, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin oligomers and metabolic characteristics are similarly distributed in adequate-for-gestationalage obese children, irrespective of the type and duration of the feeding in the first year of life. Gender and mother's BMI in pregnancy are contributors to adiponectin regulation. Further studies will explain whether breastfeeding protects against metabolic impairment later in life.

AB  - Maternal nutritional status influences fetal development and long-term risk for adult non-communicable diseases. However, the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. We examined whether biomarkers for metabolism and inflammation during pregnancy were associated with maternal health and with child biomarkers and health at 9-12 years of age in 44 maternal-child dyads from the Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT, ISRCTN34151616) in Lombok, Indonesia. Archived blood for each dyad from maternal enrollment, later in pregnancy, postpartum, and from children at 9-12 years comprised 132 specimens. Multiplex microbead immunoassays were used to quantify vitamin D-binding protein (D), adiponectin (A), retinol-binding protein 4 (R), C-reactive protein (C), and leptin (L). Principal component analysis (PCA) revealed distinct variance patterns, i.e. principal components (PC), for baseline pregnancy, bp.pc1.DAR and bp.pc2.CL; combined follow-up during pregnancy and postpartum, dp-pp.pc1.DARL and dp-pp.pc2.ACL; and children, ch.pc1.DRC and ch.pc2.DAL. Maternal multiple micronutrient (MMN) supplementation led to an association of baseline maternal bp.pc2.CL with decreased post-supplementation maternal dp-pp.pc2.ACL (p = 0.022), which was in turn associated with both increased child ch.pc1.DRC (p = 0.036) and decreased child BMI z-score (BMIZ) (p = 0.022). Further analyses revealed an association between maternal dp-pp.pc1.DARL and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.036). Child ch.pc1.DRC was associated with decreased birth weight (p = 0.036) and increased child BMIZ (p = 0.002). Child ch.pc2.DAL was associated with increased child BMIZ (p = 0.005), decreased maternal height (p = 0.030) and girls (p = 0.002). A pattern of elevated maternal adiponectin and leptin in pregnancy was associated with increased C-reactive protein, vitamin A, and D binding proteins pattern in children, suggesting biomarkers acting in concert may have qualitative as well as quantitative influence beyond single biomarker effects. Patterns in pregnancy proximal to birth were more associated with child status. In addition, child patterns were more associated with child status, particularly child BMI. MMN supplementation affects maternal biomarker patterns of metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy, and potentially in the child. However, child nutrition conditions after birth may have a greater impact on metabolism and inflammation.

AB  - In India, diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are growing health problems. CVD accounts for much of the increased morbidity and premature mortality associated with type 2 diabetes. Moreover, CVD also occurs 2-3 decades earlier among diabetic subjects and runs a more aggressive course and has a worse prognosis. The pathophysiology of the link between diabetes and CVD is complex and multifactorial and understanding the mechanisms of the disease can help identify and treat CVD in patients with diabetes and vice versa. The current article reviews the common antecedents between type 2 diabetes and CVD including non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors and suggests that future research on diabetes and CVD should focus on searching for risk factors for CVD that may be more specific to diabetes, such as hypoglycaemia or medication related comorbidities. Also, the authors recommend research on common genetic variants which might have stronger effects and hence have a potential role in diabetes and CVD risk prediction. Finally, primary prevention trials trying to prevent both diabetes and CVD are the urgent need of the hour!

AB  - Objective The common marmoset as a model of early obesity was assessed. The hypotheses that juvenile marmosets with excess adipose tissue will display higher fasting glucose, decreased insulin sensitivity, and decreased ability to clear glucose from the blood stream were tested. Design and Methods Normal and obese (body fat > 14%) common marmoset infants (N = 39) were followed up from birth until 1 year. Body fat was measured by quantitative magnetic resonance. Circulating glucose was measured by glucometer and insulin, adiponectin, and leptin by commercial assays. The quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (QUICKI; a measure of insulin sensitivity) was calculated for subjects with fasting glucose and insulin measures. Oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were conducted at 12 months on 35 subjects. Results At 6 months, obese subjects already had significantly lower insulin sensitivity (mean QUICKI = 0.378 +/- 0.029 vs. 0.525 +/- 0.019, N = 11, P = 0.003). By 12 months, obese subjects also had higher fasting glucose (129.3 +/- 9.1 mg/dL vs. 106.1 +/- 6.5 mg/dL, P = 0.042), and circulating adiponectin tended to be lower (P = 0.057). Leptin was associated with percent body fat; however, birth weight also influenced circulating leptin. The OGTT results demonstrated that obese animals had a decreased ability to clear glucose. Conclusions Early-onset obesity in marmosets results in impaired glucose homeostasis by 1 year.

AB  - Preeclampsia, a common complications of pregnancy, is associated with an increase in the concentration of leptin in the maternal blood, which precedes the clinical onset of the disease. This review addresses the potential sources of leptin and considers the possible consequences, although at present these are entirely conjectural. The placenta is likely to contribute to the rise in leptin, and placental hypoxia and inflammatory mediators may be important stimuli. The possible protective and damaging sequelae of an increase in the maternal leptin concentrations may range from beneficial stimulation of fetal growth to an increase in blood pressure through stimulation of sympathetic activity. Further research is needed to determine if the rise in leptin plays a role in preeclampsia or whether it is a secondary and unrelated bystander.

AB  - Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) was first reported in 1994 and has been explored in various human disease processes. However, until recently, very little has been done to define the role of NAMPT in pregnancy. NAMPT is a 52 kDa protein that has diverse functions in the human body, acting as a growth factor, cytokine, an enzyme, and an insulinomimetic agent. Initial studies examined NAMPT expression in fetal membranes and its effects on the amnion. Later research in nonpregnant studies showed an insulinomimetic effect, and attention focused on its role in gestational diabetes. In addition, as studies revealed NAMPT's function as an inflammatory cytokine, studies examined NAMPT in preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction. Several studies have confirmed that NAMPT is a marker of systemic infectious processes such as pyelonephritis and intrauterine infection. In this review, we present the current understanding of NAMPT's role in various pregnancy-related conditions as well as possible directions for future research.

AB  - Our aim was to study the expression of adipokine-encoding genes (leptin, adiponectin, and angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4)) in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and adipokine concentration in cord blood from women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) depending on glycaemic targets. GDM patients were randomised to 2 groups per target glycaemic levels: GDM1 (tight glycaemic targets, fasting blood glucose < 5.1 mmol/L and <7.0 mmol/L postprandial, N = 20) and GDM2 (less tight glycaemic targets, <5.3 mmol/L and < 7.8 mmol/L, respectively, N = 21). The control group included 25 women with normal glucose tolerance. ANGPTL4 expression was decreased in the HUVECs from GDM patients versus the control group (23.11 +/- 5.71, 21.47 +/- 5.64, and 98.33 +/- 20.92, for GDM1, GDM2, and controls; p < 0.001) with no difference between GDM1 and GDM2. The level of adiponectin gene expression was low and did not differ among the groups. Leptin gene expression was undetectable in HUVECs. In cord blood, leptin/adiponectin ratio (LAR) was increased in GDM2 compared to controls and GDM1 (p = 0.038) and did not differ between GDM1 and controls. Tight glycaemic targets were associated with normalisation of increased LAR in the cord blood. ANGPTL4 expression was downregulated in HUVECs of newborns from GDM mothers and was not affected by the intensity of glycaemic control.

AB  - Kisspeptin, the product of the hypothalamic KISS1 gene, is a main regulator of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis and could be a link between metabolism and reproduction through its interaction with leptin. Kisspeptin could be involved in gonadotropin regulation and responsive to leptin levels from the first stages of life, exhibiting, as does leptin, sexual dimorphism. To test our hypothesis, we have analyzed plasma kisspeptin levels and their possible relationship with gonadotropins and leptin in a cohort composed of newborns (n = 86) and adults (n = 55). Plasma kisspeptin, gonadotropin and leptin levels were measured by RIA and multiplexed bead immunoassays, respectively. We have built a multivariate linear regression model (analyzing kisspeptin and LH separately as dependent variables) by stepwise analysis, incorporating the variables that had shown significant correlation in the univariate analysis. Cord blood samples exhibited high kisspeptin levels 127.01(113-141.02 pmol/l), but these were not sexually dimorphic. The adult population exhibited sexual dimorphism (3.72(2.95-4.49) vs. 1.77(1.23-2.31)pmol/l women vs. men, p<0.05). Leptin levels showed sexual dimorphism in cord blood samples and also in the adult population. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction between LH and kisspeptin levels and kisspeptin was negatively correlated with age. The high kisspeptin levels observed in cord blood, with no sexual dimorphism, suggest a placental source. The sexual dimorphism exhibited in adulthood supports the notion that there are different sources and/or differential kisspeptin regulation between men and women. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Mild gestational diabetes is a common complication of pregnancy, affecting up to 9% of pregnant women. Treatment of mild GDM is known to reduce adverse perinatal outcomes such as macrosomia and associated birth injuries, such as shoulder dystocia, bone fractures and nerve palsies. This study aimed to compare the plasma glucose concentrations and serum insulin, leptin and adiponectin in cord blood of babies of women (a) without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), (b) with mild GDM under routine care, or (c) mild GDM with treatment., METHODS: 95 women with mild GDM on oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) at one tertiary level maternity hospital who had been recruited to the ACHOIS trial at one of the collaborating hospitals and randomised to either Treatment (n = 46) or Routine Care (n = 49) and Control women with a normal OGTT (n = 133) were included in the study. Women with mild GDM (treatment or routine care group) and OGTT normal women received routine pregnancy care. In addition, women with treated mild GDM received dietary advice, blood glucose monitoring and insulin if necessary. The primary outcome measures were cord blood concentrations of glucose, insulin, adiponectin and leptin., RESULTS: Cord plasma glucose was higher in women receiving routine care compared with control, but was normalized by treatment for mild GDM (p = 0.01). Cord serum insulin and insulin to glucose ratio were similar between the three groups. Leptin concentration in cord serum was lower in GDM treated women compared with routine care (p = 0.02) and not different to control (p = 0.11). Adiponectin was lower in both mild GDM groups compared with control (Treatment p = 0.02 and Routine Care p = 0.07), while the adiponectin to leptin ratio was lower for women receiving routine care compared with treatment (p = 0.08) and control (p = 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Treatment of women with mild GDM using diet, blood glucose monitoring and insulin if necessary, influences the altered fetal adipoinsular axis characteristic of mild GDM in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antenatal and early neonatal nutritional environment may influence later metabolic health. Infants of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have higher risk for childhood obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Leptin and adiponectin are known biomarkers for MetS and may guide interventions to reduce later obesity. We sought to examine the relationship between birthweight, early infancy feeding practices, and biomarkers for MetS in offspring of women with mild GDM., STUDY DESIGN: Secondary analysis of a prospective observational follow-up study on the offspring of women who participated in a multicenter randomized treatment trial on mild GDM. Children were evaluated by research coordinators and biospecimens collected at the age of 5 to 10. Plasma concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were compared between large for gestational age (LGA) and average birthweight (AGA) infants, and according to whether solid foods were introduced early (<6 months of age) or at the recommended age (>=6 months of age). Multivariable analysis adjusted for fetal sex, race/ethnicity, and maternal body mass index., RESULTS: Leptin and adiponectin were measured in 336 plasma samples. In bivariate analysis, compared with AGA children, LGA children had lower leptin (5.0 ng/mL [3.6-6.0] vs. 5.8 ng/mL [4.5 = 6.6], p = 0.01) and similar adiponectin (6.3 microg/mL [5.1-7.9] vs. 6.4 microg/mL [5.3-8.6], p = 0.49) concentrations. Maternal/child characteristics were similar between the early/delayed solid feeding groups. Leptin and adiponectin concentrations were similar in the early fed and delayed feeding groups (5.8 ng/mL [4.6-6.7] vs. 5.6 ng/mL [4.2-6.6], p = 0.50 and 6.4 microg/mL [5.4-8.1] vs. 6.4 microg/mL [5.1-8.8], p = 0.85, respectively). After controlling for covariates, children who were LGA and AGA at birth had similar leptin concentrations., CONCLUSION: Birthweight and early infancy feeding practice are not associated with alterations in leptin and adiponectin in children of women with mild GDM., KEY POINTS: . Adipocytokines are markers of metabolic status.. . Children of women with mild GDM may be at risk for MetS.. . Biomarkers similar in LGA and AGA groups.. . Biomarkers similar in early and delayed solid-fed groups.. . Nonhuman milk does not modify effect of feeding practice.. Copyright Thieme. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To ascertain whether fetal growth restriction is associated with alterations of leptin concentrations in umbilical cord blood and maternal serum., METHODS: Maternal serum and umbilical cord blood leptin concentrations were determined by immunoradiometric assay at term in 43 women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies (group A) and in 27 women with singleton pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction (group B), all with normal pregravid body mass index (BMI)., RESULTS: Maternal serum leptin concentrations were significantly higher in group B compared with group A (45.0 ng/mL [range 34.2-54.9] versus 29.0 ng/mL [range 24.7-33.3]; P<.01). Umbilical cord blood leptin levels were significantly lower in group B compared with group A (8.4 ng/mL [range 3.6-13.2] versus 13.1 ng/mL [9.7-16.5]; P<.01). Maternal serum leptin levels were not significantly correlated with maternal BMI or with neonatal birth weight in either group. Umbilical cord blood leptin concentrations were significantly correlated with neonatal birth weight in both groups., CONCLUSION: Growth restricted fetuses at term show umbilical cord blood leptin concentrations significantly lower than those in normal fetuses, suggesting that fetal adipose tissue is a major source of leptin. Maternal serum leptin concentrations are higher in the presence of a growth restricted fetus. This increase might be due to an intrinsic placental mechanism, by which small placentas produce more leptin as a compensatory mechanism, or to early hypoxia.

AB  - AIM: We examined ghrelin, leptin and insulin in maternal blood during normal pregnancy and pregnancy complicated by urinary tract infection (UTI), as well as in cord blood at labor., METHODS: A total of 36 delivering women with history of UTI during the third trimester of pregnancy were enrolled in the study; 12 healthy pregnant women served as a control. Infection markers (CRP and procalcitonin) were determined in maternal blood during the course of UTI and at labor. Ghrelin, leptin and insulin were determined during labor in venous maternal and in umbilical cord blood., RESULTS: We found negative correlation between infection markers in maternal blood during UTI, and level of tested hormones in cord blood, indicating potential risk of placental impairment due to energetic imbalance. We noted lower level of leptin in mothers with UTI and no change in leptin from umbilical blood comparing subjects with and without UTI. Low level of ghrelin was observed in maternal and cord blood when pregnancy was complicated by UTI. Insulin concentrations were high in mothers with UTI and low in their newborn's cord blood. Increased maternal insulin level could indicate peripheral insulin resistance caused by the infection., CONCLUSION: UTI during pregnancy affects the concentration of hormones responsible for regulating energetic homeostasis within the placenta.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether low birthweight is associated with higher plasma leptin concentrations in adult life and whether leptin contributes to the metabolic alterations in adults that are associated with reduced foetal growth., DESIGN: Measurement of plasma leptin concentrations in a group of 502 men and women, aged 61-73, who were born in Hertfordshire and for whom records of birth and infant weight are available. Glucose tolerance was measured with a standard 75 g oral glucose tolerance test., MEASUREMENTS: Leptin concentrations were assayed in fasting plasma samples using a radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: Leptin concentrations ranged from 1.4 to 128.9 (mean 13.4) ng/ml and were higher in the 193 women than the 309 men (23.4 vs. 7.1 ng/ml). In both sexes leptin concentrations correlated positively with body mass index (r=0.65 in both men and women). Leptin concentration also correlated with fasting insulin (r=0.41) and with glucose and insulin concentrations 2 h after a glucose load (r=0.19 and 0.49). Adults with lower birth or infant weight had higher leptin concentrations than those of higher birthweight with similar degrees of obesity (P=0.02 and 0.06, respectively). Although both 2 h glucose and insulin concentrations negatively correlated with birthweight (r=-0.17, P<0.001 and r=-0.18, P<0.001, respectively), regression analysis suggested that the higher levels of leptin in adults who had low birthweight did not explain the association between low birthweight and glucose or insulin concentrations., CONCLUSION: These results suggest that adults who had had low birthweight had higher plasma concentrations of leptin than would be expected from their degree of obesity. The higher leptin concentrations, however, do not account for the association between birthsize and glucose tolerance. They may be a consequence of the altered body composition, hyperinsulinaemia, and other long-term endocrine changes associated with reduced foetal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Energy metabolism mediators, which include the adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin) and insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1], are hormone-like proteins, produced and expressed in the placenta and fetal membranes, with properties featuring metabolic adaptation and inflammatory processes. Due to the complexity of the metabolic adaptation of preterm neonates during the transition to extrauterine life, it becomes essential to recognize the factors that influence the alteration of the adipokines and IGF-1 levels in the early postpartum stage. This study assessed the significance of maternal-fetal-neonatal factors in predicting the levels of leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and IGF-1 in preterm infants born at 32 or fewer weeks of gestation, during the early stage of postnatal adaptation., METHODS: Energy metabolism mediator levels were measured in urine samples obtained from extremely (less than 28 weeks) and very (28-32 weeks) preterm infants, within 48 h after their birth, and before the initiation of enteral nutrition. The urine samples were analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The collected data included all birth-related maternal and neonatal factors such as maternal age, race/ethnicity, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, diabetes, gravidity, parity, type of pregnancy, mode of delivery, and antenatal use of corticosteroids, antibiotics, magnesium sulfate, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, gestational age, and birth weight. We investigated the correlation between the levels of the tested mediators, the significance of the differences in their average levels based on the dichotomized maternal and neonatal factors, and the effect of the selected factors, in multiple regression models. Data from the regression models constructed for leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and IGF-1 are presented as regression coefficient beta with Standard Error (SE) of beta, coefficient of determination (R2), and adjusted R2. Before including the factor in regression models, we tested for the multicollinearity effect. Two-sided P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant., RESULTS: Among the 70 studied infants, 47.1% were male, 40.6% were white, 28.6% were extremely preterm, and 18.6% were born with a weight <750 grams. Except for a mild interplay between the adiponectin and IGF-1 levels, there was no correlation between the levels of the other studied mediators. Up to 20% variation in the tested energy metabolism mediator levels was dependent on some of the birth-related maternal and neonatal characteristics. For instance, leptin levels were reduced in association with male gender (-0.493 [0.190], p < 0.02) and increased in infants born to primigravids (0.562 [0.215], p < 0.02). Adiponectin levels were increased in infants born to nulliparous as compared to multiparous women (0.400 [0.171], p < 0.03). Ghrelin levels were reduced in males (-0.057 [0.026], p < 0.04). IGF-1 levels were increased in the urine of extremely preterm neonates (0.357 [0.111], p < 0.01) and preterm infants born with an Apgar less than three at 1 min (0. 340 [p < 0.153], p < 0.04)., CONCLUSIONS: Nearly one-fifth of the variation in the urinary levels of the adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin) and IGF-1 during the early postnatal stage in infants born at 32 or fewer weeks of gestation was predicated on one or more of the maternal and neonatal factors such as the infant's sex, extreme preterm gestation, a low Apgar score at 1 min, or birth to nulliparous women or primigravida mothers. Further studies will be required to explain the role of energy metabolism mediators in the postnatal adaptation of preterm-born infants.

AB  - Leptin has been implicated in the regulation of body weight and energy balance; Leptin is produced by adipocytes and placental tissue. Chronic fetal hyperinsulinemia and accelerated fetal growth with increased amounts of body fat are frequent findings in the offspring of diabetic mothers. In this study, we examined whether leptin levels in cord blood of infants of type 1 diabetic mothers (n = 29), gestational diabetic mothers (n = 6 and controls (n = 96) correlated with level of maternal glucose control, maternal leptin level at delivery, gender, fetal and placental size, and C-peptide in cord blood at birth. Leptin was significantly elevated in infants of type 1 diabetic (24.7 ng/ml) and gestational diabetic mothers (29.3 ng/ml) as compared to controls (7.9 ng/ml). C-peptide was also significantly higher in infants of type 1 diabetic (0.91 nmol/l) and gestational diabetic mothers (0.99 nmol/l) vs controls (0.34 nmol/l). Infants of type 1 diabetic mothers with a leptin level in cord blood above the upper normal range, i.e. > 30 ng/ml (n = 13), had an average maternal HbA1c level of 5.4% (normal < 5.5%) that was not different from 5.2% in infants with a leptin level < 30 ng/ml (n = 15). In both neonatal groups of diabetic mothers, leptin in cord blood did not correlate with maternal leptin concentrations, placental weight, birthweight, gender and cord blood C-peptide. In controls, leptin in cord blood was higher in girls than in boys (p = 0.044) and correlated significantly with birthweight (p = 0.41, p < 0.001) and cord blood C-peptide (p = 0.44, p < 0.001) but not with maternal leptin level or placental weight. The 3-4 times higher leptin levels in the offspring of diabetic mothers than normal could reflect increased adipose tissue mass and/or increased contribution from other sources such as placental tissue.

AB  - Context Metabolic endotoxemia may be a shared mechanism underlying childhood obesity and early-onset metabolic diseases (e.g., type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease). Objective Examine prospective associations of serum endotoxin biomarkers lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and its binding protein, LPS binding protein (LBP), and anti-endotoxin core IgG (EndoCabIgG) with adiposity and cardiometabolic risk in youth. Design/setting This prospective study included 393 youth in the EPOCH cohort in Colorado. Participants were recruited 2006-2009 at age 10 y (baseline) and followed for six years (follow-up). We examined associations of endotoxin biomarkers at baseline with adiposity (BMI z-score, VAT, SAT, skinfolds, waist circumference) and cardiometabolic risk (insulin, glucose, adipokines, lipid profile, blood pressure) across both visits using mixed-effects regression, and with hepatic fat fraction (HFF) at follow-up using linear regression. Results Higher LPS and LBP predicted greater adiposity across follow-up. Each 1-unit ln-transformed LPS corresponded with 0.23 (95% CI: 0.03, 0.43) units BMI z-score, 5.66 (1.99, 9.33) mm (3) VAT, 30.7 (8.0, 53.3) mm (3) SAT, and 8.26 (4.13, 12.40) mm skinfold sum. EndoCabIgG was associated with VAT only (3.03 [0.34, 5.71] mm (3)). LPS was associated with higher insulin (1.93 [0.08, 3.70] mu U/mL) and leptin (2.28 [0.66, 3.90] ng/mL), and an adverse lipid profile. No association was observed with HFF. Accounting for pubertal status and lifestyle behaviors did not change findings. However, adjustment for pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational diabetes attenuated most associations. Conclusions Serum endotoxin may be a marker of pathophysiological processes underlying development of childhood obesity and cardiometabolic conditions associated with exposure to fetal overnutrition.

AB  - CONTEXT: Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool to characterize biomarkers and elucidate physiological processes underlying adverse health outcomes. Little is known of these relationships during gestation and infancy, which are critical period for development of metabolic disease risk., OBJECTIVES: To identify cord blood metabolite patterns associated with birth size; and to investigate relations of the birth size-associated metabolite patterns, and a branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolite pattern with a range of newborn and perinatal characteristics., METHODS: Using untargeted mass-spectrometry, we quantified metabolites in cord blood of 126 mother-child pairs. After excluding 103 xenobiotics, we used principal components analysis (PCA) to consolidate the remaining 606 metabolites into principal components ("factors"). Next, we identified factors associated with gestational age-and sex-standardized birthweight z-score (BW/GA) and examined associations of the BW/GA-associated pattern(s) and the BCAA pattern with cord blood insulin, leptin, adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-2, and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) using multivariable linear regression. Finally, we examined associations of maternal/perinatal characteristics with the cord blood metabolite patterns., RESULTS: Mean BW/GA z-score was 0.27+/-0.98 units. About half of the infants were male (52.4%) and white (57.1%). Of the 6 factors identified from PCA, one was associated with higher BW/GA: Factor 5, which comprised metabolites involved in energy production (malate, succinate, fumarate) and nucleotide turnover (inosine 5-monophosphate, adenosine 5-monophosphate, cytidine 5-monophosphate) pathways. In multivariable analysis, Factor 5 was related to higher cord blood leptin (1.64 [95% CI: 0.42, 2.87] ng/mL) and IGF-1 even after adjusting for IGFBP-3 (3.35 [0.25, 6.44] ng/mL). The BCAA pattern was associated with higher BW/GA (0.20 [0.03, 0.36] z-scores) and IGFBP-3 (106.5 [44.7, 168.2] ng/mL). No maternal characteristics were associated with either metabolite pattern; however, infants born via Cesarean delivery exhibited a higher score for Factor 5, and gestation length was inversely associated with the BCAA pattern., CONCLUSIONS: Metabolites in energy production and DNA/RNA turnover pathways in cord blood are associated with larger size at birth, and higher leptin and IGF-1. Similarly, the BCAA pattern was associated with larger birth size and IGFBP-3. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of birth size and weight gain during 4 early-life age intervals with midchildhood adiposity and metabolic profile and to evaluate for an interaction between birth size and early-life weight gain., STUDY DESIGN: Using data from 963 participants of Project Viva, a US prebirth cohort, we used multivariable linear regression to examine relations of birth size (tertiles of birthweight-for-gestational-age z-score) and weight gain (body mass index z-score [BMIZ] change) during 4 age intervals (birth-6 months, 6 months-1 year, 1-2 years, 2-3 years) with body composition and metabolic biomarkers during midchildhood (6.6-10.7 years)., RESULTS: After accounting for confounders and previous growth, greater BMIZ change during all 4 age intervals corresponded with higher midchildhood adiposity, with larger effect sizes for later (1-2 years and 2-3 years) vs earlier (birth-6 months and 6 months-1 year) time frames. We observed effect modification by birth size for the birth-6 months and 6 months-1 year intervals. Greater birth-6 months BMIZ change was associated with higher overall adiposity (0.40 [95% CI 0.29, 0.51] kg dual x-ray absorptiometry total fat mass per z-score) among children in the highest birth size tertile. Similar associations were observed for central adiposity. Each increment in 6 months-1 year BMIZ change corresponded with 0.55 (0.05, 1.05) units higher homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance and 2.68 (0.96, 4.40) ng/mL higher leptin among the smallest infants., CONCLUSIONS: BMIZ gain after 1 year is associated with greater midchildhood adiposity regardless of birth size, whereas the long-term influence of weight gain during the first postnatal year may depend on size at birth. Future studies are warranted to validate findings and examine relations with conventional birth size cut-offs. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies correlated maternal serum and fetal cord Leptin Levels in pregnancy with new born weight (NBW) and maternal body mass index (BMI). However, there are only a few published studies concerning amniotic fluid leptin and its possible relationship to fetal growth and NBW., OBJECTIVES: To correlate leptin and insulin in amniotic fluid and maternal serum collected at 16-20 gestational weeks to NBW., METHODS: This was an observational study in which maternal serum Leptin, insulin, and amniotic fluid Leptin and insulin, studied from 70 healthy pregnant women undergoing amniocentesis for karyotyping, at 16-20 weeks gestation. NBW was correlated with maternal BMI and leptin and insulin Levels in maternal serum and amniotic fluid., RESULTS: Maternal serum leptin was detected as the best predictor of NBW. Squared correlation coefficient, r2 = 0.09, was statistically significant (P < 0.01). Maternal BMI correlated significantly with serum Levels of insulin and leptin r2 = 0.16 and 0.27 respectively, P < 0.01., CONCLUSION: In normal pregnancies, amniotic fluid Leptin correlates partially with NBW. Maternal serum leptin correlates significantly with NBW.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Obesity during pregnancy increases the risk of adverse clinical outcomes and is associated with low-grade chronic inflammation. We describe maternal metabolic risk and inflammation by maternal weight status, and evaluate the association of metabolic and inflammatory markers with birthweight in a group of pregnant Mexican women., METHODS: This study derived from a prospective cohort of healthy pregnant women <14 weeks of gestation, receiving prenatal care at National Institute of Perinatology (Mexico, 2009-2013). Metabolic and inflammatory markers were measured in maternal serum in all three pregnancy trimesters (1st: 11.42+/-1.7; 2nd: 21.06+/-2.4; 3rd: 32.74+/-2.3 weeks). Pregestational weight was self-reported, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Gestational weight gain was evaluated in the third trimester. Newborn's weight was measured at birth. We carried out correlations, general mixed linear model and regression analyses, based on pregestational weight (self-reported), body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain (evaluated in the third trimester) and newborn weight (measured at birth)., RESULTS: Of the 177 women included in the study (mean age = 26.93+/-8.49), thirty-eight percent (n = 67) were overweight or had obesity, and 32.8% (n = 58) showed excessive gestational weight gain. We found insulin, lipids (including total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides-TG), leptin and interleukin 1b (IL-1b) all increased significantly (p<0.05) during pregnancy. Pregestational maternal weight status altered longitudinal concentrations of insulin, leptin, adiponectin, TG and C reactive protein. Excessive gestational weight gain was associated with higher maternal insulin in the third trimester (p<0.05). Early pregnancy leptin and TNFalpha were determinants of birthweight in women with normal weight, but not in overweight or obese women., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal weight status affected the concentrations of insulin, leptin, adiponectin, triglycerides and C reactive protein throughout pregnancy. The role of early leptin and TNFalpha in fetal growth need further study given the association was only observed in normal weight women. This study presents data distribution of metabolic and inflammatory markers of normal weight and overweight/obese women that did not develop GDM, preeclampsia nor macrosomia.

AB  - Leptin is now considered an important signalling molecule of the reproductive system, as it regulates the production of gonadotrophins, the blastocyst formation and implantation, the normal placentation, as well as the foeto-placental communication. Leptin is a peptide hormone secreted mainly by adipose tissue, and the placenta is the second leptin-producing tissue in humans. Placental leptin is an important cytokine which regulates placental functions in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Leptin seems to play a crucial role during the first stages of pregnancy as it modulates critical processes such as proliferation, protein synthesis, invasion and apoptosis in placental cells. Furthermore, deregulation of leptin levels has been correlated with the pathogenesis of various disorders associated with reproduction and gestation, including polycystic ovary syndrome, recurrent miscarriage, gestational diabetes mellitus, pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. Due to the relevant incidence of the mentioned diseases and the importance of leptin, we decided to review the latest information available about leptin action in normal and pathological pregnancies to support the idea of leptin as an important factor and/or predictor of diverse disorders associated with reproduction and pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect successsively serum leptin levels in normal, pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH) pregnant women., METHODS: Levels of serum leptin were measured in the 16-20, 24-28, 32-36 weeks of gestation, at the delivery time in 50 healthy, 14 PIH pregnant women and their newborns and in 40 healthy non-pregnant women by Immuno-radioassay method. Serum leptin levels were correlated with body weight, body mass index (BMI), blood pressure and placental weight., RESULTS: (1) The serum leptin levels were increased gradually during the normal (14.1 +/- 2.2)-(25.4 +/- 2.7) micro g/L and the PIH pregnancy [(13.4 +/- 3.0)-(21.4 +/- 3.7)] micro g/L, especially in the PIH women. It was found that leptin concentrations rose markedly from 28 to 36 weeks of gestation, but increased slightly before the 28 weeks of gestation and after the 36 weeks of gestation in normals, and in contrast to the normal pregnancy, consistently higher until to the delivery time in the PIH. (2) The positive correlations were significant between the levels of serum leptin with their body weight and BMI in the normal pregnant and non-pregnant women (r = 0.478-0.639, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), but not significant in the PIH pregnant (r = 0.035-0.379, P > 0.05). (3) The positive correlations were significant between the serum leptin concentrations and the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean artery pressure in the PIH women after 20 weeks of gestation (r = 0.639-0.852, P < 0.05), but not significant in the normal pregnant, the PIH before 20 weeks of gestation and the non-pregnant women (r = 0.113-0.498, P > 0.05). (4) Before the delivery time, the positive correlation between the serum leptin concentrations of the pregnant women and that of the newborns was not significant, and also not significant between the puerperas' serum leptin levels and the placental weight in the normal pregnant (r = 0.132, 0.097, P > 0.05). But it was interesting that significant positive correlation was found between the puerperas' serum leptin concentrations and the cord serum leptin levels (r = 0.792, P < 0.01) and significant negative correlation was detected between the puerperas' serum leptin levels and the placental weight in the PIH women (r = -0.819, P < 0.01). (5) The leptin levels of cord blood were positively correlated with the body weight and BMI of newborns in both of the normal and PIH pregnancy (r = 0.520-0.655, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: The characteristic change of serum leptin levels and correlations between the serum leptin concentrations and the related pregnant signs was different in normal and PIH pregnancy.

AB  - Objective: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are at risk of future obesity and associated comorbidities. Therefore the identification of risk factors and novel biomarkers which are associated with this risk are needed for early detection and to improve preventive strategies. Spexin (SPX), a novel neuropeptide that is involved in the regulation of obesity and fat metabolism, is a candidate biomarker for predicting obesity and related comorbidities at an early age. The aim of this study was to investigate serum levels of SPX in term infants born small, appropriate, and large for gestational age (LGA) and its association with newborn anthropometric measurements., Methods: One hundred and twenty term newborn babies classified as SGA, appropriate for gestational age (AGA), or LGA and their mothers were included. SPX, leptin and visfatin were measured in cord blood and maternal serum by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., Results: Fifty-six (46.7%) neonates were girls and 64 (53.3%) were boys. The mean birth weight was 3170.70+/-663 g, birth length was 48.9+/-2.79 cm, and head circumference was 34.5+/-1.67 cm. Birth weights, lengths, and head circumferences of the neonates in the SGA, AGA, and LGA groups were significantly different. Cord blood SPX and leptin levels in the SGA groups were significantly lower than those of both the LGA and AGA groups. Cord blood visfatin levels were significantly lower in the AGA group than the LGA and SGA groups. Maternal SPX levels of SGA babies were significantly lower than those of the mothers in both the LGA and AGA groups, but no significant difference was observed between the SGA and LGA groups. Maternal visfatin levels of the AGA babies were significantly higher than the maternal levels of SGA and LGA groups. There was no difference in terms of maternal leptin levels. Cord blood SPX and leptin levels were positively correlated with birth weight, length and head circumference. Birth weight increased significantly in line with maternal pregestational body mass index., Conclusion: The lowest SPX levels were found in the SGA babies and cord SPX level was significantly correlated with newborn length, weight, and head circumference.

AB  - Introduction. Overweight and obesity is a global epidemic among children of all age groups. Obese children are at increased risk of insulin resistance, cardiovascular disease (including arterial hypertension), as well as bone fractures and psychological problems. In this regard, insulin resistance has become one of the most serious health concerns in overweight and obese children. The objective of the study was to investigate the specifics for carbohydrate metabolism in overweight and obese children, to identify the key factors for insulin resistance and to develop a regression analysis-based prognostic model to predict its occurrence. Material and methods. In 90 obese and 20 overweight children aged between 10-17 years, anthropometric measurements, history data collection and laboratory investigations were performed. Multiple regression analysis has been used to develop a mathematical model for prediction of insulin resistance. Results. Such variables as weight, body mass index, waist and hip circumferences, abdominal type obesity, family history, duration of breastfeeding (if any), birth weight, sedentary lifestyle, leptin and adiponectin levels and dyslipidemia were closely related to fasting glucose levels and insulin/insulin resistance indices. Conclusions. Abdominal obesity, male gender, family history of abnormal carbohydrate metabolism, insulin levels, duration of breastfeeding and plasma leptin levels have been defined as main predictors of insulin resistance in overweight and obese children and were included in regression equation for the index of insulin resistance using the method of multiple regression analysis.Copyright © 2019 Balkan Medical Union.

AB  - Fetuses exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have a higher risk of abnormal glucose homeostasis in later life. The molecular mechanisms of this phenomenon are still not fully understood. Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) appears to be one of the most probable candidates involved in the pathophysiology of GDM. The main aim of the study was to investigate whether umbilical cord serum FABP4 concentrations are altered in term neonates born to GDM mothers. Two groups of subjects were selected-28 healthy controls and 26 patients with GDM. FABP4, leptin, and ghrelin concentrations in the umbilical cord serum, maternal serum, and maternal urine were determined via an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The umbilical cord serum FABP4 levels were higher in the GDM offspring and were directly associated with the maternal serum FABP4 and leptin levels, as well as the prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) and the BMI at and after delivery; however, they correlated negatively with birth weight and lipid parameters. In the multiple linear regression models, the umbilical cord serum FABP4 concentrations depended positively on the maternal serum FABP4 and negatively on the umbilical cord serum ghrelin levels and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. There are many maternal variables that can affect the level of FABP4 in the umbilical cord serum, thus, their evaluation requires further investigation.

AB  - Two-thirds of pregnant women exceed gestational weight gain recommendations. Excessive gestational weight gain (EGWG) appears to be associated with offspring's complications induced by mechanisms that are still unclear. The aim of this study was to investigate whether umbilical cord leptin (UCL) and ghrelin (UCG) concentrations are altered in full-term neonates born to EGWG mothers and whether neonatal anthropometric measurements correlate with UCL and UCG levels and maternal serum ghrelin and leptin as well as urine ghrelin concentrations. The study subjects were divided into two groups, 28 healthy controls and 38 patients with EGWG. Lower UCL and UCG levels were observed in neonates born to healthy mothers but only in male newborns. In the control group UCG concentrations correlated positively with neonatal birth weight, body length and head circumference. In the control group maternal serum ghrelin levels correlated negatively with neonatal birth weight, body length and head circumference as well as positively with chest circumference. In the EGWG group UCG concentrations correlated negatively with neonatal birth weight and birth body length. UCL correlated positively with birth body length in EGWG group and negatively with head circumference in the control group. In conclusion, EGWG is associated with disturbances in UCL and UCG concentrations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: During pregnancy, maternal circulating leptin is released by maternal adipose tissue and the placenta, and may have a role in fetal development., OBJECTIVES: We investigated maternal leptinemia and glycemia associations with neonatal adiposity, taking into account pregravid weight status., METHODS: We included 235 pregnant women from the Genetics of Glucose Regulation in Gestation and Growth prospective cohort with data: blood samples collected during the 2nd trimester, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and the measured leptin and glucose levels. As an integrated measure of maternal leptin exposure, we calculated the area under the curve for maternal leptin at the OGTT (AUCleptin). Within 72 h of delivery, we measured the triceps, biceps, subscapular, and suprailiac skinfold thicknesses (SFTs); the sum of these SFTs represented neonatal adiposity. We conducted a regression analysis to assess the maternal metabolic determinants of neonatal adiposity, adjusting for parity, smoking status, maternal triglyceride levels, gestational weight gain, placental weight, delivery mode, neonate sex, and gestational age at delivery., RESULTS: The pregravid BMI of the participating women was 23.3 (21.2-27.0). In the 2nd trimester, maternal AUCleptin was 1,292.0 (767.0-2,222.5) (ng x min)/mL, and fasting glucose levels were 4.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/L. At delivery, the neonatal sum of 4 SFTs was 17.9 +/- 3.3 mm. Higher maternal leptinemia was associated with higher neonatal adiposity (beta = 4.23 mm [SE = 1.77] per log-AUCleptin; p = 0.02) in mothers with a BMI >=25, independently of confounders and maternal glycemia, but not in mothers with a BMI <25. Higher maternal fasting glucose was associated with higher neonatal adiposity (beta = 0.88 mm [SE = 0.30] per SD glucose; p = 0.005) in mothers with a BMI <25, independently of confounders and maternal leptinemia., CONCLUSION: Maternal leptinemia may be associated with neonatal adiposity in offspring from overweight/obese mothers, independently of maternal glycemia.

AB  - Context: Offspring exposed in utero to maternal obesity have an increased risk of later obesity; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unknown., Objective: To assess the effect of an antenatal lifestyle intervention in obese women on the offspring's cord blood metabolic profile and to examine associations of the cord blood metabolic profile with maternal clinical characteristics and offspring anthropometry at birth and age 6 months., Design: Randomized controlled trial and cohort study., Setting: The UK Pregnancies Better Eating and Activity Trial., Participants: Three hundred forty-four mother-offspring pairs., Intervention: Antenatal behavioral lifestyle (diet and physical activity) intervention., Main Outcome Measures: Targeted cord blood metabolic profile, including candidate hormone and metabolomic analyses., Results: The lifestyle intervention was not associated with change in the cord blood metabolic profile. Higher maternal glycemia, specifically fasting glucose at 28 weeks gestation, had a linear association with higher cord blood concentrations of lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs) 16.1 (beta = 0.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.03 to 0.10) and 18.1 (0.52; 0.02 to 0.80), independent of the lifestyle intervention. A principal component of cord blood phosphatidylcholines and LPCs was associated with infant z scores of birth weight (0.04; 0.02 to 0.07) and weight at age 6 months (0.05; 0.00 to 0.10). Cord blood insulin growth factor (IGF)-1 and adiponectin concentrations were positively associated with infant weight z score at birth and at 6 months., Conclusions: Concentrations of LPCs and IGF-1 in cord blood are related to infant weight. These findings support the hypothesis that susceptibility to childhood obesity may be programmed in utero, but further investigation is required to establish whether these associations are causally related.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to examine the changes in bacteria in hospitalized preterm infants during the first month of life., METHODS: Rectal swabs were collected daily from 12 preterm infants. DNA was extracted from swabs from day of birth and weekly thereafter. Bacterial taxa were identified with next generation sequencing using universal bacterial primers targeted at the 16S ribosomal DNA on a 454 Roche titanium platform. Sequences were clustered into operational taxonomic units, and taxonomy was assigned against the Greengenes databank using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology version 1.4. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the abundance of Bifidobacterium spp. Functional assessment of the microbiome was performed with Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved States (PICRUSt)., RESULTS: Average birth weight and gestational age were 1055 g and 28 weeks, respectively. There were 6 to 35 different bacterial families identified in the day-of-birth samples, unrelated to the mode of delivery. Richness decreased through hospitalization (week 1, 16.9 +/- 7.7 vs weeks 3-5, 10.7 +/- 3.4, P < 0.001). The Shannon diversity index demonstrated the lowest diversity at birth, an increase at week 2, followed by a rapid decline at weeks 3 to 5, suggesting the development of a more uniform microbiota composition after 2 weeks of stay at a neonatal intensive care unit. Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcaceae, and Enterococcaceae constituted the majority of the bacterial families. Bifidobacterium spp were infrequently detected at extremely low levels. PICRUSt analysis revealed the enhancement of peroxisome, PPAR, and adipocytokine signaling; plant-pathogen interaction; and aminobenzoate degradation pathways in week 1 samples., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although preterm infants have individualized microbiota that are detectable at birth, the differences decrease during the neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization with increasing prominence of pathogenic microbiota.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the extent to which known prenatal and perinatal predictors of childhood obesity also predict weight gain in early infancy., STUDY DESIGN: We studied 690 infants participating in the prospective cohort Project Viva. We measured length and weight at birth and at 6 months. Using multivariable linear regression, we examined relationships of selected maternal and infant factors with change in weight-for-length z-score (WFL-z) from 0 to 6 months., RESULTS: Mean (standard deviation) change in WFL-z from 0 to 6 months was 0.23 (1.11), which translates to 4500 grams gained from birth to 6 months of life in an infant with average birth weight and length. After adjustment for confounding variables and birth weight-for-gestational age z-score (-0.28 [95% confidence interval, -0.37, -0.19] per unit), cord blood leptin (-0.40 [95%confidence interval, -0.61, -0.19] per 10 ng/mL), and gestational diabetes -0.50 [95%confidence interval, -0.88, -0.11] versus normal glucose tolerance)were each associated with slower gain in WFL-z from 0 to 6 months., CONCLUSIONS: Higher neonatal leptin and gestational diabetes predicted slower weight gain in the first 6 months of life. The hormonal milieu of the intrauterine environment may determine growth patterns in early infancy and thus later obesity.

AB  - Undernutrition is responsible for up to 45% of deaths in children under five, with low- and middle-income countries disproportionately affected. Adipokines are known modulators of metabolism and have been linked to growth rates and neurocognition during infancy. We examined the relationship(s) between cord blood adiponectin and leptin and both longitudinal growth and cognition during the first year of life using generalized estimating equations. Infants were classified as underweight (weight-for-age z-score [WAZ]), stunted (height-for-age z-score [HAZ]) or wasted (weight-for-height z-score [WHZ]) using WHOAnthro software. Cord blood adiponectin and leptin levels were highly correlated (r = 0.35, P < 0.0001) and positively associated with birth WAZ (r = 0.34 and r = 0.45, P < 0.0001, respectively). Adipokines were independently, inversely associated with weight gain. Infants in the highest quintile of adipokine production had a lower risk of being stunted, while neither was associated with lower WAZ or WHZ in final adjusted models. Cognition was not found to be independently related to cord blood leptin or adiponectin. The negative association with adipokines and rate of weight gain during infancy may reflect heightened nutritional status at birth rather than a direct hormonal influence. The relationship between leptin or adiponectin and longitudinal length gains suggests that both adipokines may promote linear growth during infancy. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Leptin is involved in the regulation of body weight through a feedback signal between adipose tissue and the satiety center, to decrease food intake and increase energy expenditure. Newborn infants experience physiological weight loss during the first week of life. The leptin level may be decreased to enhance food intake and to decrease energy expenditure for physiological adaptation during early postnatal days. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) and insulin are involved in the regulation of perinatal growth. Leptin might be interrelated with IGF-I or insulin, since both of these have adipogenic and somatotropic effects. We therefore hypothesized that leptin, IGF-I and insulin would be decreased during the first week of life, concurrently with physiological weight loss. Thirty preterm AGA infants (birth weight 1.574+/-313 g; GA 31.9+/-2.2 wk) were studied. All infants received parenteral nutrition from the third day after birth. Leptin was significantly decreased during the first week of life, and insulin was significantly increased at day 7 vs. day 1 and day 3. IGF-I did not change during the first week of life. Leptin was positively correlated with body weight (r = 0.368, p<0.01), body mass index (r = 0.267, p<0.05), and serum IGF-I (r = 0.330, p <0.01), but not with serum insulin. The percent of weight reduction during the first week of life was not correlated with the percent of leptin reduction during the first week of life. In conclusion, leptin was significantly decreased and positively correlated with body weight and IGF-I during the first week of life. Changes of leptin and insulin might be related to postnatal adaptation in metabolism, but the exact role of leptin, IGF-I and insulin in postnatal physiological weight loss is not clear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking is linked with several neonatal metabolic disorders. Adiponectin is an adipose-specific hormone with anti-inflammatory and antiatherogenic properties., AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of maternal smoking on cord blood adiponectin concentrations., METHODS: We evaluate the effect of maternal smoking on cord blood adiponectin concentrations comparing 14 full-term and seven preterm newborns born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy with 77 full-term and 10 preterm neonates born to non-smokers mothers., RESULTS: Maternal smoking during pregnancy was significantly associated with decreased adiponectin levels of preterm newborns (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings also reveal a significant relationship between the reported number of cigarettes smoked during pregnancy and cord blood adiponectin concentrations (p = 0.01), suggesting that this association could have a causal relationship.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is the only adipose-specific hormone that, despite its exclusive production by adipose tissue, is reduced in obesity and is inversely correlated with leptin levels in adults. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adiponectin concentration in umbilical cord blood at different gestational ages and to investigate its possible associations with leptin levels and birth weight., RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Umbilical cord blood was obtained from 132 newborns (male = 65, female = 67, gestational age: 35 to 42 weeks). The anthropometric variables of the newborns studied were birth weight, birth length, body weight/body length, and ponderal index. Adiponectin, insulin, and leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay methods., RESULTS: Adiponectin levels in males were not different from those in females (24.10 +/- 0.81 vs. 25.62 +/- 0.84 micro g/mL, p = 0.280). Adiponectin concentrations were positively correlated with birth weight (p < 0.05), birth length (p < 0.05), body weight/body length (p < 0.05), gestational age (p < 0.01), and leptin levels (p < 0.01)., DISCUSSION: These findings indicate that adiponectin is present in umbilical cord blood after 35 to 42 weeks of gestation, with higher levels than those usually found in adults, no gender differences, and a positive correlation with birth weight and leptin. These results suggest that not only could neonatal hyperadiponectinemia be associated with the increase of adiponectin production by fetal adipose tissue but also with a possible reduction in an unknown mechanism related to the suppression of adiponectin observed in adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Leptin, a hormone produced in adipose tissue and the placenta, is correlated with neonatal growth. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of maternal smoking during pregnancy on cord blood leptin concentrations in term, appropriate-for-gestational-age infants., METHODS: Two groups of term, appropriate-for-gestational-age newborns were selected: 19 infants of smoking mothers and 91 infants of non-smoking mothers. Neonatal anthropometric measurements were taken and leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: Leptin concentrations were similar (p=0.915) between the groups. Leptin levels correlated only with ponderal index (p < 0.01) and gestational age of the newborns (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that maternal smoking during pregnancy does not affect cord blood leptin levels in term, appropriate-for-gestational-age infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine cord blood leptin levels in newborns appropriate for gestational age, according to gender, birth weight, birth height and ponderal index., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 132 term newborns appropriate for gestational age (68 females, 64 males), gestational age between 35-42 weeks. Data were collected through interviews with the mothers at the maternity, anthropometrycal study of the newborns, and cord blood estradiol, testosterone and leptin assays obtained immediately after birth., RESULTS: The levels of leptin were significantly higher in females than in males (8.34+/-0.65 ng/ml versus 6.06+/-0.71 ng/ml; p = 0.000). The concentrations of estradiol and testosterone did not differ between males and females. Leptin levels were positively correlated with gestational age (r = 0.394, p < 0.01), birth weight (r = 0.466, p < 0.01), birth length (r = 0.335, p < 0.01) and ponderal index (r = 0.326, p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: Leptin concentration in the umbilical cord is positively correlated with gestational age, birth weight, birth height, and ponderal index, suggesting its participation in the neonatal growth process. In addition, a gender difference with higher levels of leptin in females neonates was observed, suggesting that the sexual dimorphism in relation to body composition already exists in newborns.

AB  - We investigated leptin concentration in umbilical cord blood of 51 newborns (mean 5.71 +/- 3.28 ng/ml) and in maternal blood (mean 22.11 +/- 10.95 ng/ml). Leptin concentration in 20 preterm infants (mean 4.73 +/- 2.15 ng/ml) was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than in full-term newborns (mean 6.34 +/- 2.08 ng/ml) and tended to increase according to gestational age and birth weight. We suggested leptin concentration had a role in intrauterine development.

AB  - Background & aims: Scientific evidence confirms the favorable impact of Mediterranean diets (MD) on maternal and neonatal outcomes. However, the assessment of this dietary pattern requires valid indexes with scoring systems adapted to pregnant females. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to compare the adherence to MD, through 5 internationally validated tools, in pregnant women following a Mediterranean eating pattern, correlated to maternal anthropometric, dietary and biochemical markers. Methods: 100 healthy pregnant females completed a sociodemographic questionnaire, a dietary recall and a food frequency questionnaire compatible with the MD.10 ml of maternal blood were drawn for the analysis of biological markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin and adiponectin. Results: We used the 50th percentile as cut-off of each scale (low or high adherence) to avoid the discrepancies noted in the literature among the large range of cut-offs points for the different tools. The % of agreement was high between the Mediterranean Food Pattern, MD Score, the MD Score and the Short MD Questionnaire. The MD Scale presented small agreement in relation to the other tested tools. All the tested indexes were significantly correlated with CRP levels, except for the MDScale. Significant correlations were reached regarding adiponectin and the MFP (p value = 0.04) and the MDScale (p value 0.03) tools. Pre-gestational body mass index was significantly correlated with all the tested biological markers. Significant correlations were seen between CRP on one hand and maternal age (p value = 0.033), adiponectin (p value = 0.028), and leptin (p value = 0.003) on the other. Fiber intake was significantly and negatively correlated to CRP (p value = 0.008) and positively to adiponectin levels (p value = 0.000). Conclusions: None of the tested tools were adapted for pregnancy, since a-priori scores were attributed for components already not consumed by pregnant females such as alcohol or recommended for daily or weekly consumptions such as whole dairy products and fish, respectively. In addition, the lack of inclusion of some traditional food ingredients of the MD implies the urge to create a new index adapted to pregnancy.

AB  - AIM: Fatty acid-binding protein-4 (FABP4) is an adipokine associated with obesity and signs of the metabolic syndrome. We aimed to investigate at birth in term neonates with normal and abnormal intrauterine growth concentrations of FABP4 and associate them with various perinatal parameters., METHODS: Serum cord blood FABP4 levels were prospectively determined by ELISA in 80 singleton term appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA), intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) and large-for-gestational-age (LGA) neonates., RESULTS: Compared to the AGA group, cord blood FABP4 levels were increased in the IUGR and LGA groups. Additionally, they were higher in early-term than full-term neonates. A significant U-shaped correlation was recorded between serum FABP4 levels and birthweight. A significant negative correlation between cord blood FABP4 and gestational age in the whole study population was noted., CONCLUSION: Cord blood FABP4 levels were significantly higher at the extremes of foetal growth at term and negatively correlated with gestational age, being increased in early-term versus full-term neonates. Further longitudinal studies with larger sample sizes are required to elucidate FABP4 implication in foetal growth and its association with future adverse cardiometabolic outcomes in the offspring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the connection between maternal first trimester serum leptin levels and newborn weight., METHODS: The study included 37 preeclamptic women and 53 normotensive women who considered the control group. Maternal blood samples were withdrawn at 13 weeks of gestation for the measurement of leptin concentrations. Birth weights were transformed to z-scores according to maternal and obstetrical features, based on customized centiles. Non-parametric tests, student's t-test, Pearson's correlation, Spearman's correlation and linear regression analysis were performed in our analysis., RESULTS: Pre-pregnancy body mass index and first trimester maternal plasma leptin levels were significantly higher among women with preeclampsia (p=0.015 and p<0.001, respectively). Birth weight z-score was negatively correlated with leptin levels (r= -0.570, p<0.001), in preeclamptic group and in control group (r= -0.477, p<0.001). The regression modelling demonstrated a significant negative association between birth weight z-scores and leptin for both groups., CONCLUSION: Maternal first trimester serum leptin demonstrates a significant negative association with neonatal weight in preeclamptic pregnancies and to a lesser extent in normotensive pregnancies. A possible leptin's involvement in pathophysiological adaptations that define the foetal growth potential can be supported.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alterations in plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations are associated with an adverse metabolic profile in obese children., OBJECTIVE: To simultaneously assess multiple factors with possible effects on plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations in healthy, non-obese children., SUBJECTS: We studied 170 healthy non-obese children (86 males, age 10+1.5 years), with available medical records from birth., METHODS: Plasma leptin and adiponectin concentrations were assessed by immunoassay. The ratio of current weight/birth weight (WBWR) was used as an index of children growth from birth. Children's intensity of physical activity and parental characteristics were also assessed., RESULTS: Leptin was positively associated with WBWR (p<0.0001); parental smoking (analysis of variance, ANOVA; p-=0.03) and parental obesity (ANOVA; p<0.001) were negatively associated with breastfeeding (p<0.01) and children's access to exercise (p<0.0001). Adiponectin was negatively associated with WBWR (p<0.0001) and parental smoking (p=0.04), with an additive negative effect of parental smoking status and parental obesity on children's adiponectin levels (ANOVA; p=0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Children's and parental factors are related and could possibly influence leptin and adiponectin concentrations in healthy non-obese children. Early preventive strategies that target both children and parents could improve the profile of adipocytokine in these children.

AB  - To study the role of various hormones in the control of fetal leptin secretion during labour, 33 pregnant women with normal singleton term pregnancy were recruited. At the time of spontaneous vaginal delivery, a venous blood sample was taken from the women together with a venous and an arterial cord blood sample. In all blood samples, leptin, cortisol, prolactin and progesterone were measured. Serum leptin and cortisol values were significantly higher, while those of prolactin and progesterone were significantly lower in the mother than in the two umbilical vessels (p < 0.01). Cortisol levels were significantly higher in the umbilical artery than in the umbilical vein (p < 0.01). Serum leptin values in the umbilical artery and vein correlated significantly with the corresponding values of cortisol (r = 0.523 and r = 0.580 respectively, p < 0.01), but not with those of prolactin and progesterone. A weak but significant correlation was found between leptin values in the two umbilical vessels and birth weight (r = 0.385 and r = 0.401 respectively, p < 0.05). In multiple regression analysis, cortisol values but not birth weight was the most important determinant of leptin values. Birth weight, however, correlated significantly with placental weight (r = 0.776, p < 0.001). These results demonstrate for the first time that leptin concentrations in the umbilical vessels at normal vaginal delivery correlate significantly with cortisol values, thus providing evidence that cortisol mediates a labour stimulating effect on fetal leptin secretion. It is suggested that cord blood leptin values at delivery are not a good predictor of neonatal weight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that the circulating levels of leptin in the maternal and cord serum correlate with the birthweight of the newborns and with the weight of the placenta., METHODS: In a population of 85 women from northern Greece who gave birth to an equal number of full-term infants, we calculated the concentration of leptin in the maternal serum as well as in the cord serum, right after delivery, by using an immunoradiometric assay. The correlation between these values, the maternal BMI before pregnancy and at the time of delivery, the neonatal BMI, Ponderal Index, and the placental weight was studied., RESULTS: Mean maternal leptin showed a statistically significant difference from mean cord serum leptin (14.7 and 7.07 ng/ml, respectively) and was positively correlated to the maternal BMI at the time of delivery (r = 0.3, P = 0.016), but not to neonatal BMI. A positive correlation between the mean cord serum leptin and the BMI of the neonates (r = 0.26, P = 0.031 ) was found. There was no correlation between the maternal BMI at the time of delivery and the neonatal BMI. Similarly, no correlation could be established between the placental weight and the levels of leptin in the maternal or in the cord serum but a positive correlation between placental weight, neonatal BMI and weight, and mothers' BMI was observed. Finally, although a noteworthy difference between the mean leptin levels of neonates of two different sexes was observed (male 5.9 ng/ml, female 7.8 ng/ml), that difference never reached a statistically significant level., CONCLUSIONS: The maternal leptin level could not be used as a reliable marker of fetal growth but a positive correlation between cord serum leptin and fetus growth is suggested.

AB  - Adiponectin, is a novel hormone secreted by the adipose tissue. This active protein plays a role in the regulation of whole body energy homeostasis. It enhances insulin sensitivity and has antiatherogenic properties, reduces hepatic glucose production, and diminishes gluconeogenesis. Adiponectin accelerates the oxidation process of fatty acids in muscle cells, reduces triglycerides plasma concentration. In addition, plasma adiponectin levels negatively correlated with BMI and fat content. Numerous analyses have indicated that hypoadiponectinemia is a consequence of the development of obesity in childhood. The adiponectin secretion in newborn children is higher than in older, an child small for gestational age has lower plasma concentration of this protein. Clinical studies suggest that adiponectin deficiency associates with gestational diabetes in women. However, serum adiponectin levels in type 1 diabetes have not been elucidated, probably factors other than glucose and insulin play a significant role in adiponectin secretion in type 1 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity increases the risk for pregnancy complications and adverse neonatal outcome and has been associated with long-lasting adverse effects in the offspring, including increased body fat mass, insulin resistance, and increased risk for premature cardiovascular disease. Lifestyle interventions in pregnancy have produced no or modest effects in the reduction of adverse pregnancy outcomes in obese mothers. The Metformin in Obese Pregnant Women trial was associated with reduced adverse pregnancy outcomes and had no effect on birthweight. However, the long-term implications of metformin on the health of offspring remain unknown., OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to assess whether prenatal exposure to metformin can improve the cardiovascular profile and body composition in the offspring of obese mothers., STUDY DESIGN: In 151 children from the Metformin in Obese Pregnant Women trial, body composition, peripheral blood pressure, and arterial pulse wave velocity were measured. Central hemodynamics (central blood pressure and augmentation index) were estimated with the use of an oscillometric device. Left ventricular cardiac function and structure were assessed by echocardiography., RESULTS: Children were 3.9+/-1.0 years old, and 77 of them had been exposed to metformin prenatally. There was no significant difference in peripheral blood pressure, arterial stiffness, and body composition apart from gluteal and tricep circumferences, which were lower in the metformin group (P<.05). The metformin group, compared with the placebo group, had lower central hemodynamics (mean adjusted decrease, -0.707 mm Hg for aortic systolic blood pressure, -1.65 mm Hg for aortic pulse pressure, and -2.68% for augmentation index; P<.05 for all) and lower left ventricular diastolic function (adjusted difference in left atrial area, -0.525 cm2, in isovolumic relaxation time, -0.324 msec, and in pulmonary venous systolic wave, 2.97 cm/s; P<.05 for all). There were no significant differences in metabolic profile between the groups., CONCLUSION: Children of obese mothers who were exposed prenatally to metformin, compared with those who were exposed to placebo, had lower central hemodynamic and cardiac diastolic indices. These results suggest that the administration of metformin in obese pregnant women potentially may have a beneficial cardiovascular effect for their offspring. Copyright © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Adiponectin is the most abundant protein secreted by the white adipose tissue. It circulates at high levels in the bloodstream and its serum concentration is inversely correlated with body fat mass. The wide distribution of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1, AdipoR2, and T-cadherin) in peripheral tissues and organs allows adiponectin to exert pleiotropic effects on whole-body metabolism. Besides its well-known antidiabetic, antiatherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties, accumulating evidence suggests a direct role for adiponectin in reproductive tissues. The mammalian ovary and the ovarian follicle express AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, and treating pig granulosa cells with adiponectin induces changes characteristic of the periovulatory period. Moreover, additive effects are observed between adiponectin and insulin in induction of granulosa cell gene expression, thus suggesting that adiponectin actions on the ovary may be mediated through its insulin-sensitizing effects. Adiponectin receptors are also detected in the uterus. In women, higher AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 gene expression was observed during the mid-secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, suggesting that adiponectin is implicated in the endometrial changes in preparation for embryo implantation. Adiponectin receptors are found in oocytes and early developing pig, rabbit, and mice embryos, and it has been demonstrated that adiponectin can increase the success of porcine embryo development to the blastocyst stage in vitro. Moreover, adiponectin concentration is two to three times greater in human fetal circulation and in umbilical cord blood, compared to adult plasma. This further indicates a role for adiponectin in fetal growth. It has been further suggested that adipose-derived and locally produced adiponectin may act as a key neuromodulator of reproductive functions. For example, the inhibition of LH and GnRH release from rat pituitary and hypothalamic cells following treatment with adiponectin provides evidence that adiponectin may also act on the release of gonadotropins. Adipose tissue is now recognized as an important factor in the complex equation by which the nutritional status regulates female reproductive functions. For example, underweight women have delayed puberty and higher risk of premature delivery, whereas overweight and obese women have early puberty and are prone to develop polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), and preeclampsia. Because hypoadiponectinemia is often associated with the abovementioned disorders, it has been suggested that this adipokine might play a role in the development of these pregnancy-related complications. Moreover, as these reproductive disorders often come with metabolic complications such as insulin and glucose resistance, the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin may explain the observed association of this adipokine with PCOS, GDM, and preeclampsia. This review summarizes current knowledge on the role of adiponectin in female reproductive tissues and highlights mechanisms where information is available. We also discuss about the known and potential roles of adiponectin in the development of reproductive disorders. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: It has been shown that some adipocytokines and their mutual relationship can be indicators of fetal and neonatal growth. Physiological role of leptin and adiponectin in fetal and neonatal growth is not well established., OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the correlation of the anthropometrics parameters and serum concentration of leptin and adiponectin levels in healthy newborns., METHODS: A cohort of 110 neonates, born after uncomplicated singleton pregnancies at term, were classified as AGA (n = 60), SGA (n = 30) and LGA (n = 20) according to the Lubchenco curves. Anthropometric parameters of the neonates: birth weight (BW), birth length (BL), body weight/body length ratio (BW/ BL), Body Mass Index (BMI) and Ponderal Index (II) were recorded after birth., RESULTS: Mean serum leptin and adiponectin levels in both sexes were not significantly different (male: 1.8 +/- 0.75; 29.5 +/- 22.89 and female: 2.0 +/- 0.99; 31.6 +/- 23.51 ng/mL). There was a significant difference between leptin levels in AGA and LGA newborns 11.9 +/- 0.84 vs. 3.1 +/- 1.50 ng/mL) (p < 0.05), and in adiponectin levels between AGA and LGA compared to SGA newborns (32. +/- 23.29 and 43.4 +/- 31.24 vs. 12.6 +/- 2.43 ng/mL, respectively; p < 0.05; p < 0.05). Leptin and adiponectin levels were positively correlated with BW (r = 0.63 and r = 0.41), BL (r = 0.63, r = 0.42), BW/BL (r = 0.61, r = 0.41), BMI (r = 0.54, r = 0.35), and PI (r = 0.47, r = 0.29, (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: Significantly higher adiponectin levels were found in AGA neonates compared to SGA neonates. Leptin and adiponectine levels were positively correlated with birth weight. These findings suggest that these adipocytokines may be involved in fetal growth regulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to determine serum adiponectin levels among patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normal pregnant women without glucose intolerance, and to investigate the relationship between these levels and clinical factors at the time of the diagnosis, at delivery and in the post-partum period., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The subjects' serum adiponectin concentration was measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method at 24th-28th week of gestation, at delivery (in maternal circulation and the umbilical cord) and 24 h after delivery. The relationship between these groups' measurements and other established clinical-laboratory factors were investigated., RESULTS: Serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower (p = 0.02) in GDM patients compared with patients with normal glucose tolerance at 24th-28th week of gestation. During delivery, maternal serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower (p = 0.03) in GDM patients compared with patients with normal glucose tolerance. In the post-partum period, serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.009) in GDM patients compared with patients with normal glucose tolerance. Umbilical cord adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower (p = 0.005) in GDM patients compared with patients with normal glucose tolerance., CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin concentrations in GDM patients' circulation were regulated by changes in glucose and insulin metabolism. A reduction in serum adiponectin levels seems to play a role in GDM patients' insulin resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate serum levels of adiponectin in pregnant adolescents between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation., METHOD: A prospective cross-sectional study enrolled 67 normal pregnant women between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation and eutrophic (body mass index [BMI]: 18.5-25 kg/m2), of which 36 were adolescents (< 20 years old) and 31 adults (>= 20 years old). Serum adiponectin levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The t-student or Mann-Whitney tests were used for intergroup comparison., RESULTS: Pregnant adolescents showed significantly higher serum adiponectin concentrations compared with pregnant adults (p = 0.04). No differences were observed in adiponectin levels in younger pregnant adolescents (< 16 years old) compared with older pregnant adolescents (>= 16 years old). Adiponectin values were divided into 3 subgroups: < 3,000 ng/mL, between 3,000 and 5,000 ng/mL, and > 5,000 ng/mL. Birthweight was significantly higher in women > 5,000 ng/mL when compared with < 3,000 ng/mL in the adolescent group. No association between pregestational adiponectin levels and BMI, gestational weight gain, and gestational age was observed; however, there was a positive relation with birthweight (p = 0.0239)., CONCLUSION: Serum adiponectin values in pregnant adolescents between 30 and 36 weeks of gestation were higher compared with pregnant adults; however, no differences between younger and older pregnant adolescents were observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, and hypertensive disorders in later life in the preterm population. We studied school-age children who had been born extremely premature who had undergone endocrine, cardiovascular, and anthropometric evaluations., METHODS: School age measurements of salivary cortisol, adrenal androgens, blood pressure, and anthropometric markers were correlated with DNA methylation of 11-betahydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11BHSD2), leptin, and the LINE1 repetitive DNA element., RESULTS: We observed a modest correlation between log AUC for salivary cortisol and methylation of leptin in preterm infants and a negative correlation between methylation of region 1 of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR in term-born infants. There was an association between LINE1 methylation and cortisol response to awakening and a negative correlation between LINE1 and systolic blood pressure at 6-7 years. Methylation of the GR promoter region showed a positive association with systolic blood pressure at 6-7 years of age., CONCLUSIONS: These results show that extremely preterm birth, followed by complex patterns of endocrine, cardiovascular, and metabolic exposures during early postnatal life, is associated with lasting changes in DNA methylation patterns in genes involved in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis function, adrenal hormonal regulation, and cardiometabolic risk., IMPACT: Preterm infants have significant environmental and physiological exposures during early life that may have lasting impact on later function. Alterations in hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis (HPA) function have been associated with these exposures. We examined the associated changes in DNA methylation of important genes involved in HPA function, metabolism, and global DNA methylation. The changes we saw in DNA methylation may help to explain associated cardiovascular, metabolic, and growth disturbance in these children in later life. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Babies born small for gestational age (SGA) are at risk of obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS). Spexin (SPX) is a novel peptide implicated in food intake and obesity. Spexin levels are lower in obese subjects. This study investigated the potential association of SPX and some obesity related peptides such as leptin and active ghrelin with size at birth and MetS components in prepubertal children born term and either SGA or appropriate for GA (AGA). Secondary aim was to identify whether any of the investigated peptides were associated with MetS components., METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional study of 37 consecutive (median age: 5.6 y) SGA- and 50 (median age: 5.9 y) AGA-born children. Clinical evaluations were performed using standard methods. Several biochemical variables (SPX, total leptin, and active ghrelin levels) were analyzed. Age-dependent cut-off values were used to define MetS components, including excess adiposity, hypertension, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. The associations between the assessed clinical and laboratory variables and MetS components were investigated., RESULTS: Children born SGA had higher frequencies of MetS components than AGA-born peers (p < 0.01). None of the investigated peptides were different between children born SGA and AGA after correcting for body mass index (p > 0.05 for all). Serum SPX levels were lower in children with at least one metS component than those without MetS components (p = 0.018)., CONCLUSIONS: Size at birth had no association with serum SPX. Serum SPX levels are decreased in prepubertal children with MetS components. Copyright © 2022 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Monogenic obesity results from single gene mutations. Extreme obesity starting at an early age, especially in infancy, which is associated with endocrinopathy and metabolic disturbances is key to the diagnosis of monogenic obesity., CASE PRESENTATION: A 6-month-old boy was admitted to our clinic with severe obesity and food craving. He was born with a birth weight of 3400 g to first-cousin parents. He started to gain weight at an abnormal rate at the age of 2 months. He had hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia and grade 2 hepatosteatosis. He had a 7-year-old, healthy brother with a normal body weight. Because of severe early-onset obesity and abnormal food addiction, his leptin level was measured and found to be 0.55 ng/mL (normal range for his age and sex is 0.7-21 ng/mL). A LEP gene mutation was screened for and a gross leptin gene deletion was detected. To date, no report on a gross deletion of the LEP gene has been published in the literature., CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, a gross deletion of the LEP gene has not been reported so far in the literature. Here we report a unique case with congenital leptin deficiency. Thus, clinicians should search for monogenic obesity in patients with early-onset severe obesity and endocrinopathy. Measuring the leptin level could aid clinicians to identify children with monogenic obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine serum leptin levels in hypertensive disorder of pregnancy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, cross-sectional, case control study, we measured serum leptin levels of 58 hypertensive pregnant women and 54 normal pregnant women. We also did blood and urine analysis for the evaluation of the severity of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. The patients were followed until after delivery and information about labour was recorded. We analysed the difference and correlation between anthropometric measures, hormonal and biochemical parameters, and serum leptin levels in two groups., RESULTS: In the study group, serum leptin levels were determined to be higher than the control group. Neonatal birth weight was significantly lower in the hypertensive group. While the serum uric acid, urea, aspartate aminotransferase, fibronectin, and fasting blood glucose levels were found to be higher, serum total protein and albumin levels were significantly lower among the hypertensive pregnant women. Hypertensive pregnant women were more insulin resistant. Serum leptin levels were highly and positively correlated with serum fibronectin, and C peptide levels. A negative significant correlation was observed between maternal serum leptin levels and neonatal birth weight among the pregnant women having the hypertensive disorders., CONCLUSION: Serum leptin levels in hypertensive pregnant women appear to be higher. The determination of serum leptin levels may be as important as serum fibronectin and C peptide levels in the management of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy. C peptide and insulin may be due to hyperinsulinemia which leads to increased stimulation of leptin production by fatty tissue. Insulin resistance which appears in late pregnancy is more significant especially in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia.

AB  - Maternal smoking is considered to be a risk factor for low birth weight. It is hypothesized that alteration in leptin concentration may be associated with reduced fetal growth. In this study, we assess the effect of smoking during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal serum leptin concentrations, and also on breast milk leptin levels. When the infants were brought to routine physical examination at 7 days old, blood samples and breast milk specimens were taken for leptin measurement from mothers who smoked during pregnancy and their newborns. Nonsmoking mothers and their infants were recruited randomly over the same period as a control group. Maternal age, number of pregnancy, weight of the mothers, birth weight, and gestational age of the infants were similar in both groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference between groups in maternal serum and breast milk leptin levels (p = 0.14 and p = 0.96, respectively). However, serum leptin levels were found significantly lower in neonates born to smoking mothers compared with infants born to nonsmoking mothers (p = 0.02). Our findings suggest that maternal smoking dose not have an effect on maternal serum and breast milk leptin levels but decreases neonatal serum leptin concentration independent of birth weight.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the association of ghrelin, leptin, and insulin levels in the umbilical cord blood of the preterm and term infants with anthropometric measurements and glucose metabolism. Methods: Sixty-nine infants who were born between November 2004 and June 2005 were included in the study. Pregnancy ages, birth weights, heights, head circumferences, and Ponderal Indexes (PI) were identified. Ghrelin, leptin, insulin, and glucose levels in the umbilical cord blood were studied. Results: Eighteen infants out of 69 infants were preterm (34.6 +/- 0.43 weeks), and 33 infants were term (38.7 +/- 0.14 weeks). All preterm infant weights were appropriate for gestational age (AGA); 33 of the term infants' weights were AGA and 18 were large for gestational age (LGA). Leptin, insulin, and glucose levels of term infants were significantly higher compared with the preterm infants (p < .0001, p < .001, and p < .0001, respectively); no significant difference was detected in the ghrelin levels between the two groups (p > .05). The leptin and insulin levels of the term LGA infants were higher compared with the term AGA and preterm AGA infants (p < .05, for all). No difference was detected between the three groups regarding serum ghrelin levels (p > .05). No difference was found in the glucose levels between term AGA and LGA infants (p > .05); however, the serum glucose levels of term AGA and LGA infants were higher compared with levels in preterm AGA infants (p < .05, for both). A positive correlation was demonstrated in all study groups between leptin and insulin with gestational age, body weight, height, head circumference, and PI. A positive correlation was found between serum leptin levels with gestational age and insulin levels in preterm infants, and between serum leptin levels and insulin and glucose levels in term infants. No association was found between ghrelin and anthropometric measurements, leptin, insulin, and glucose levels (p > .05, for all). Conclusions: The increase of leptin production with increased gestational age, and the strong association with anthropometric measurements supports the opinion that leptin behaves as a fetal growth factor. Leptin in intrauterine life is in close association with insulin and glucose metabolism. Although ghrelin was at measurable levels in preterms, no association with fetal growth and glucose metabolism could be demonstrated in preterm and term infants.

AB  - Leptin and zinc are involved in the regulation of appetite. Copper is a trace element regulating the functions of several cuproenzymes that are essential for life. To evaluate the relationship between zinc and copper status and the leptin system in humans, we examined whether leptin concentrations in the mother and the newborn correlate with the weight of mother, placenta and newborn. A total of 88 pregnant women at 38-42 weeks' gestation were studied. All infants were categorized as small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 16), average for gestational age (AGA) (n = 59) or large for gestational age (LGA) (n = 13). Leptin, zinc, and copper levels were measured in maternal and cord serum at birth. Maternal BMI and placental weight of the LGA groups were significantly higher than those of the SGA and AGA groups. Cord and maternal leptin levels of the SGA groups were significantly lower than those of the AGA and LGA groups. Maternal serum leptin levels were positively correlated with BMI and maternal zinc levels in all groups. Cord serum leptin levels of all groups were positively correlated with birth weight and placental weight. Birth weight was negatively correlated with maternal and cord copper level of all groups. Umbilical leptin concentrations of SGA newborns correlated with leptin concentrations of their mothers. In all pregnancies, birth weight increases in association with increase in cord leptin level. Our results suggest that maternal zinc but not copper level has an effect on maternal serum leptin levels. The increase in copper level in both maternal and cord blood may contribute to restriction in fetal growth.

AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of insulin signalling. Hepatic PTP1B deficiency, using the Alb-Cre promoter to drive Ptp1b deletion from birth in mice, improves glucose homeostasis, insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic potential of decreasing liver PTP1B levels in obese and insulin-resistant adult mice. Inducible Ptp1b liver-specific knockout mice were generated using SA-Cre-ER (T2) mice crossed with Ptp1b floxed (Ptp1b (fl/fl)) mice. Mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks to induce obesity and insulin resistance. Tamoxifen was administered in the HFD to induce liver-specific deletion of Ptp1b (SA-Ptp1b (-/-) mice). Body weight, glucose homeostasis, lipid homeostasis, serum adipokines, insulin signalling and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress were examined. Despite no significant change in body weight relative to HFD-fed Ptp1b (fl/fl) control mice, HFD-fed SA-Ptp1b (-/-) mice exhibited a reversal of glucose intolerance as determined by improved glucose and pyruvate tolerance tests, decreased fed and fasting blood glucose and insulin levels, lower HOMA of insulin resistance, circulating leptin, serum and liver triacylglycerols, serum NEFA and decreased HFD-induced ER stress. This was associated with decreased glycogen synthase, eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2 alpha kinase 3, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 alpha and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase 2 phosphorylation, and decreased expression of Pepck. Inducible liver-specific PTP1B knockdown reverses glucose intolerance and improves lipid homeostasis in HFD-fed obese and insulin-resistant adult mice. This suggests that knockdown of liver PTP1B in individuals who are already obese/insulin resistant may have relatively rapid, beneficial therapeutic effects.

AB  - Leptin, a pleiotropic adipokine, crosses the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood spinal cord barrier (BSCB) from the periphery and facilitates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE induces dynamic changes of leptin receptors in enriched brain and spinal cord microvessels, leading to further questions about the potential roles of endothelial leptin signaling in EAE progression. In endothelial leptin receptor specific knockout (ELKO) mice, there were lower EAE behavioral scores in the early phase of the disorder, better preserved BSCB function shown by reduced uptake of sodium fluorescein and leukocyte infiltration into the spinal cord. Flow cytometry showed that the ELKO mutation decreased the number of CD3 and CD45 cells in the spinal cord, although immune cell profiles in peripheral organs were unchanged. Not only were CD4(+) and CD8(+) T lymphocytes reduced, there were also lower numbers of CD11b(+)Gr1(+) granulocytes in the spinal cord of ELKO mice. In enriched microvessels from the spinal cord of the ELKO mice, the decreased expression of mRNAs for a few tight junction proteins was less pronounced in ELKO than WT mice, as was the elevation of mRNA for CCL5, CXCL9, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha. Altogether, ELKO mice show reduced inflammation at the level of the BSCB, less leukocyte infiltration, and better preserved tight junction protein expression and BBB function than WT mice after EAE. Although leptin concentrations were high in ELKO mice and microvascular leptin receptors show an initial elevation before inhibition during the course of EAE, removal of leptin signaling helped to reduce disease burden. We conclude that endothelial leptin signaling exacerbates BBB dysfunction to worsen EAE. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Both gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) as well as overweight/obesity during pregnancy are risk factors for detrimental anthropometric and hormonal neonatal outcomes, identified to 'program' adverse health predispositions later on. While overweight/obesity are major determinants of GDM, independent effects on critical birth outcomes remain unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate, in women with GDM, the relative/independent impact of overweight/obesity vs. altered glucose metabolism on newborn parameters., METHODS: The prospective observational 'Early CHARITE (EaCH)' cohort study primarily focuses on early developmental origins of unfavorable health outcomes through pre- and/or early postnatal exposure to a 'diabetogenic/adipogenic' environment. It includes 205 mother-child dyads, recruited between 2007 and 2010, from women with treated GDM and delivery at the Clinic of Obstetrics, Charite - Universitatsmedizin Berlin, Germany. Recruitment, therapy, metabolite/hormone analyses, and data evaluation were performed according to standardized guidelines and protocols. This report specifically aimed to identify maternal anthropometric and metabolic determinants of anthropometric and critical hormonal birth outcomes in 'EaCH'., RESULTS: Group comparisons, Spearman's correlations and unadjusted linear regression analyses initially confirmed that increased maternal prepregnancy body-mass-index (BMI) is a significant factor for elevated birth weight, cord-blood insulin and leptin (all P < 0.05). However, consideration of and adjustment for maternal glucose during late pregnancy showed that no maternal anthropometric parameter (weight, BMI, gestational weight gain) remained significant (all n.s.). In contrast, even after adjustment for maternal anthropometrics, third trimester glucose values (fasting and postprandial glucose at 32nd and 36th weeks' gestation, HbA1c in 3rd trimester and at delivery), were clearly positively associated with critical birth outcomes (all P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Neither overweight/obesity nor gestational weight gain appear to be independent determinants of increased birth weight, insulin and leptin. Rather, 3rd trimester glycemia seems to be crucial for respective neonatal outcomes. Thus, gestational care and future research studies should greatly consider late pregnancy glucose in overweight/obese women with or without GDM, for evaluation of critical causes and interventional strategies against 'perinatal programming of diabesity' in the offspring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin critically contributes to metabolic homeostasis, especially by insulin-sensitizing action. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is characterized by insulin resistance leading to materno-fetal hyperglycemia and detrimental birth outcomes. By investigating paired subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) as well as blood (cell) samples of GDM-affected (n = 25) vs. matched control (n = 30) mother-child dyads of the prospective "EaCH" cohort study, we addressed whether alterations of adiponectin plasma, mRNA, and DNA methylation levels are associated with GDM and offspring characteristics., RESULTS: Hypoadiponectinemia was present in women with GDM, even after adjustment for body mass index (BMI). This was accompanied by significantly decreased mRNA levels in both SAT and VAT (P < 0.05), independent of BMI. Maternal plasma adiponectin showed inverse relations with glucose and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (both P < 0.01). In parallel to reduced mRNA expression in GDM, significant (P < 0.05) yet small alterations in locus-specific DNA methylation were observed in maternal fat (~ 2%) and blood cells (~ 1%). While newborn adiponectin levels were similar between groups, DNA methylation in GDM offspring was variously altered (~ 1-4%; P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Reduced adiponectin seems to be a pathogenic co-factor in GDM, even independent of BMI, affecting materno-fetal metabolism. While altered maternal DNA methylation patterns appear rather marginally involved, functional, diagnostic, and/or predictive implications of cord blood DNA methylation should be further evaluated.

AB  - Overweight women have an increased risk of decreased insulin sensitivity compared to normal weight women. In the study, it was shown that excessive gestational weight gain in prepregnancy overweight women is positively associated with increased production of leptin, resistin, and insulin, which are markers of insulin resistance and play an important role in the pathophysiology of gestational complications. It was proved that the chances of hyperleptinemia and hyperresistinemia increased in pregnant women with gestational hypertension and preeclampsia, especially in women with excessive gestational weight gain. In pregnant women with fetal growth retardation chances of insufficient leptin elevation in the second trimester increased in insufficient weight gain patients. A strong relationships between the concentration of leptin and resistin and the insulin resistance index in 22-24 weeks (r=0.83, p=0.000) and (r=0.83, p=0.000) and 37-39 weeks (r=0.86, p=0.000) and (r=0.84, p=0.000) were studied respectively. Due to insulin resistance, overweight women are at increased risk of metabolic dysregulation in pregnancy and associated negative results for the mother and fetus.

AB  - Objective: Because nutritional support in perinatal life has been associated with metabolic programming, children with a history of extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR) might display alterations in the adipocyte and in the secretion of adipokines. The aim of this study was to assess adiponectin, resistin, and leptin concentrations in prepubertal children with a history of EUGR, and to determine the potential correlation between these adipokines and metabolic parameters. Methods: This case-control study sample included 38 prepubertal children with a history of EUGR and a control group of 123 healthy children of similar age and sex. Anthropometric measures and blood pressure were assessed. Biochemical markers and blood adipokine concentrations (adiponectin, resistin, and leptin) were evaluated. Results: Adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in the EUGR group compared with controls (EUGR: 11.49 +/- 6.07 versus control: 25.72 +/- 10.13 mu g/mL), and resistin concentration was higher (EUGR: 20332.95 +/- 6401.25 versus control: 8056.31 +/- 3823.63 pg/mL), even after adjustment for gestational age, weight, and size at birth. Systolic blood pressure was associated with adipokines concentrations in the EUGR group (P < 0.001). In EUGR children adiponectin was associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (P = 0.042), whereas resistin was associated with carbohydrate metabolism parameters (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Early postnatal malnutrition in EUGR children could program adipose tissue. Plasma adipokines can be measured in childhood to identify precocious changes that may be associated with a higher risk for metabolic syndrome or cardiovascular disease later in life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ligands of peroxisome-proliferator activated receptors (PPARs), such as non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), induce expression of angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4). Recently ANGPTL4 has been reported to be a mediator of intracellular adipose lipolysis induced by glucocorticoids., OBJECTIVE: To determine the concentrations of ANGPTL4 in cord serum of neonates born by spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) and by pre-labor cesarean section (CS) from healthy women, and to relate them to parameters of neonatal lipolytic activity at birth., MEASUREMENTS: In 54 neonates born by SVD and in 56 neonates born by CS, arterial cord blood was drawn to determine insulin, cortisol, triacylglycerols (TAGs), glycerol, non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), individual fatty acids, ANGPTL4, adiponectin, retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) and leptin., RESULTS: Birth weight and neonatal fat mass in SVD and CS showed no difference, but the concentrations of glycerol, adiponectin, RBP4, NEFAs and most individual fatty acids were higher in cord serum of neonates born by SVD compared to CS, indicating a higher adipose tissue breakdown in the SVD group. The concentrations of TAG and cortisol were also higher and that of insulin was lower in cord serum of SVD compared to the CS group. However, the concentration in cord serum of ANGPTL4 did not differ between the two groups and no positive correlation with either NEFA or glycerol concentrations were detected., CONCLUSION: ANGPTL4 is known to stimulate lipolysis in adults, but does not appear to mediate the increased activity in SVD, indicating the presence of different regulatory inputs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the concentrations of adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) and other adipocytokines in maternal and cord serum of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and of control subjects and to relate them to indexes of insulin sensitivity., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 86 control and 98 GDM pregnant women, venous blood was collected before vaginal delivery and arterial blood from cord immediately after delivery. Serum insulin and adipocytokines were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)., RESULTS: GDM women had higher prepregnancy BMI, and data were adjusted for it. Maternal serum insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, homeostasis model assessment (HOMA), AFABP, and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) were higher and adiponectin was lower in GDM than in control subjects, whereas serum glucose, insulin, insulin-to-glucose ratio, HOMA, nonesterified fatty acids, and RBP4 were higher and glycerol, AFABP, and adiponectin were lower in cord blood serum of GDM than of control subjects. AFABP and adiponectin in cord serum of control subjects were higher than in maternal serum; in GDM women no difference was found for AFABP in cord versus maternal serum, although adiponectin remained higher in cord. Values of leptin in both groups were lower in cord than in maternal serum, and those of RBP4 were lower in only GDM women., CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that fetal tissues are the main source of cord arterial serum AFABP, and in GDM fetuses AFABP values correlate with adiposity markers. A downregulation of adiponectin and upregulation of RBP4 in GDM mothers and their fetuses may be related to their insulin-resistant condition, whereas changes in AFABP do not seem to be related.

AB  - There are specific biomarkers - indicators of normal and abnormal processes - in diabetic pregnancies that predict the degree of diabetic control as well as embryonic and fetal growth and development. They can be detected in maternal blood, amniotic fluid or in the cord plasma of the newborn infant. While the cord plasma levels are of little clinical relevance because they do not allow us to interfere with the outcome of pregnancy, biomarkers in maternal blood or amniotic fluid may help us to better control the outcome of diabetic pregnancies. Important biomarkers in maternal blood are fasting glucose, HbA1c and IGFs. Relevant biomarkers in amniotic fluid are insulin, erythropoietin and markers of bone formation and resorption. Cord plasma biomarkers include IGFs, leptin, adiponectin, resistin, markers of oxidative stress and of hypoxia. Whether these biomarkers can be predictors of long term outcome in infants of diabetic mothers is yet to be determined. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Adipose tissue programming could be developed in very preterm infants with extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR), with an adverse impact on long-term metabolic status, as was studied in intrauterine growth restriction patterns. The aim of this cohort study was to evaluate the difference in levels of plasma adipokines in children with a history of EUGR. A total of 211 school age prepubertal children were examined: 38 with a history of prematurity and EUGR (EUGR), 50 with a history of prematurity with adequate growth (PREM), and 123 healthy children born at term. Anthropometric parameters, blood pressure, metabolic markers and adipokines (adiponectin, resistin, leptin) were measured. Children with a history of EUGR showed lower values of adiponectin (mug/mL) compared with the other two groups: (EUGR: 10.6 vs. PREM: 17.7, p < 0.001; vs. CONTROL: 25.7, p = 0.004) and higher levels of resistin (ng/mL) (EUGR: 19.2 vs. PREM: 16.3, p =0.007; vs. CONTROL: 7.1, p < 0.001. The PREM group showed the highest values of leptin (ng/mL), compared with the others: PREM: 4.9 vs. EUGR: 2.1, p = 0.048; vs. CONTROL: 3.2, p = 0.029). In conclusion, EUGR in premature children could lead to a distinctive adipokines profile, likely associated with an early programming of the adipose tissue, and likely to increase the risk of adverse health outcomes later in life.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate changes in skinfold measurements taken at three sites, mid-arm circumference and umbilical circumference during the first 15 days of life; and to evaluate relationships between anthropometric measurements and umbilical cord blood serum leptin levels in infants born small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants. Of 50 newborn infants, 25 were SGA and 25 were AGA. Neonates' weight, mid-arm circumference (MAC), umbilical circumference (UC), and triceps, subscapular and periumbilical skinfold thicknesses were measured (Holtain callipers) immediately after delivery. Anthropometric parameters were measured again at 15th days of age. At birth, mean birth weight, mean skinfold thickness, MAC and UC measurements in the AGA group were significantly higher than those of the SGA group. These differences were also found on the 15th day. Birth weight correlated with all skinfold thicknesses, MAC and UC at birth. Weight at 15th day of life correlated with skinfold thicknesses, MAC and UC at 15th day of life. Cord blood leptin level was significantly lower in the SGA than in the AGA infants. This difference continued on the 15th day. When cord blood leptin level was compared with that of the 15th day, we found that leptin levels in the cord blood were significantly higher. There were significantly positive correlations between leptin levels and birth weight and skinfold thicknesses when the infants were all grouped together. When the newborns were grouped according to birth weight, there were positive correlations between cord blood serum leptin levels and these parameters in the AGA group, but no correlation in the SGA group. At the 15th day of life serum leptin levels correlated with weight, subscapular and triceps skinfold thickness in the AGA group, but only with triceps skinfold thickness in the SGA group.

AB  - This study was planned to investigate the relationship between birth weight and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and leptin levels in neonates with normal growth (appropriate for gestational age: AGA) and retarded growth (small for gestational age: SGA); and to evaluate these growth factors' effects in early postnatal growth. All newborns were full-term: gestational age 3,841 weeks. Of 50 neonates, 25 were SGA. IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin levels were measured in maternal serum and venous cord blood at birth and at 15 days of life of neonates using specific RIAs. Maternal serum leptin concentrations were significantly higher than cord blood leptin concentrations (p < 0.001). Maternal serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin levels did not show correlations with birth weight. In contrast, there were significantly positive correlations between birth weight and venous cord blood IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin levels (p < 0.001). In the SGA group, the newborns with a slow postnatal growth pattern had lower umbilical cord serum IGF-I levels compared with newborns with a normal growth pattern. A similar result was also found in the AGA group. Similar results were not found for serum leptin and IGFBP-3. In conclusion, cord blood IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin levels play an important role in the regulation of fetal and neonatal growth. It is likely that IGF-I has a more important role than the other factors in early postnatal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin is an insulin-sensitizing protein that circulates in oligomeric complexes, including trimers, hexamers and high-molecular-weight (HMW) multimers. In pregnant women, conflicting associations have been reported between maternal serum levels of total adiponectin (i.e. reflecting all isoforms) and infant birthweight. As the HMW complex has recently been proposed as the primary mediator of metabolic bioactivity, we hypothesized that differences in isoform distribution may underlie these conflicting reports. Therefore, we evaluated the relationship between maternal adiponectin isoforms and infant birthweight., DESIGN/PATIENTS/MEASUREMENTS: HMW and total adiponectin, as well as the ratio of HMW to total adiponectin (ratio known as S(A)), were measured in healthy pregnant Caucasian women (n = 58) undergoing an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), following an abnormal glucose challenge test., RESULTS: On univariate analysis adjusted for neonate gender and length of gestation, birthweight was positively correlated with weight gain in pregnancy (r = 0.29, P = 0.031) and inversely associated with the IS(OGTT) index of insulin sensitivity (r = -0.27, P = 0.041), total adiponectin (r = -0.31, P = 0.021), HMW adiponectin (r = -0.34, P = 0.0093) and S(A) (r = -0.34, P = 0.011). On multiple linear regression analyses, however, total adiponectin was not related to birthweight. By contrast, HMW adiponectin was related at borderline significance (t = -1.87, P = 0.068), while S(A) emerged as an independent negative determinant of infant birthweight (t = -2.46, P = 0.0175). Adjusted mean neonatal birthweight was significantly higher in the infants of women comprising the lowest tertile of S(A) compared to women in the highest tertile of S(A) (3684 vs. 3424 g, P = 0.0375)., CONCLUSIONS: The proportion of maternal serum adiponectin in HMW form (S(A)) is independently and inversely associated with infant birthweight. Thus, adiponectin isoform distribution, rather than total adiponectin concentration, may be a correlate of foetal size.

AB  - In adults, lower circulating levels of the adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin are associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease risks. Its use as a risk marker in children is less clear. In 839 children aged 8 years from a representative birth cohort, circulating adiponectin levels were associated with body weight, BMI, waist circumference, and fasting and 30-min insulin levels, but the associations were opposite in boys, with positive associations, and girls, with inverse associations (P = 0.008-0.00001 for interaction with sex). Girls had overall higher adiponectin, higher total cholesterol, lower HDL cholesterol, and higher triglyceride levels than boys, even after adjustment for BMI. With increasing BMI, girls showed steeper declines in HDL cholesterol (P = 0.01 for interaction) and adiponectin levels (P = 0.0005 for interaction) and a steeper increase in triglyceride levels (P = 0.009 for interaction) compared with boys. In conclusion, plasma adiponectin is not a simple marker of central fat and insulin sensitivity in children. With increasing BMI, decreasing adiponectin levels in girls could contribute to their faster deterioration in lipid profiles in comparison with boys. Our data suggest a complex age- and sex-related regulation of adiponectin secretion or clearance.

AB  - Being born small for gestational age (SGA) is one of the most common causes of childhood short stature, and recombinant GH therapy has been recently licensed to promote growth in short SGA children from the age of 4 years old. Studies are now reporting very encouraging effects on adult height gains, especially in those children who started GH therapy early, at least 2 years prior to the onset of puberty. Compared to the age at starting treatment, the GH dose has a less significant impact on final height, and more attention needs to be paid now to identify earlier those SGA children who fail to catch-up spontaneously. The benefits are not just in terms of height, but also in body composition and possibly blood pressure and lipid levels. However the risk of side effects and long-term complications, particularly related to the expected metabolic effects of GH in inducing insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, need to be carefully monitored especially in SGA children with a family history of type 2 diabetes. Recently, GH therapy was found to amplify the adrenarche of short SGA children and to induce a pro-inflammatory shift, as judged by a rise of neutrophil count and circulating interleukin-6 (IL-6), and a fall in adiponectin levels. Further progress is anticipated to assess the addition of insulin-sensitizing therapy to attenuate the GH-induced hyperinsulinemia, in order to alter the pro-inflammatory course, to avoid excessive release of adrenal androgens, and to slow down the potential rapid tempo of pubertal progression in SGA children. In the meantime, post-SGA short stature is rapidly becoming one of the prime indications for GH therapy in childhood.

AB  - Recent discoveries of human genetic leptin deficiency have demonstrated its importance in regulating weight gain in early childhood. To investigate whether normal variation in leptin and insulin levels in cord blood could influence infancy growth, we assayed samples from 197 infants from a representative birth cohort, who were measured at birth, 4, 8, 12 and 24 months. Cord leptin levels correlated most closely with weight and ponderal index (kg/m3) at birth, but also with length and head circumference (all p<0.0005). Independent of birth size, females had higher leptin levels than males (p<0.0005). Cord levels of leptin, but not insulin, were negatively related to weight gain (p<0.005) from birth to 4 months, and accounted for 9.4% of the variance in weight gain, compared with breast/bottle feeding (3.5%) and early/late introduction of solids (1%). The effect of leptin levels on weight gain was independent of birthweight, and was still evident at 24 months. The wide variation in infancy growth ('catch-up' or 'catch-down') may be partly determined by leptin levels preset in utero. Our data support a role for leptin in the regulation of infancy weight gain, and suggest a mechanism whereby infants may 'catch-up' in growth postnatally following an adverse intrauterine environment.

AB  - Experimental animal studies demonstrate the effects of leptin on appetite, weight gain and metabolism. The biological effects of leptin in human adults are still to be determined, but recent reports show that congenital leptin deficiency leads to hyperphagia and excessive weight gain from early infancy as well as failure of pubertal onset in adolescence. Our recently reported data from two longitudinal cohorts suggest a role for leptin in the normal regulation of childhood weight gain, maturation and the development of secondary sexual features and body composition. Low leptin levels in cord blood closely reflected decreased adiposity at birth and strongly predicted high rates of weight gain in infancy and catch-up growth. In adolescents, leptin levels rose gradually with age prior to puberty, suggesting that a threshold effect may trigger puberty. In girls, low leptin levels at the start of puberty predicted large gains in the percentage of fat mass, perhaps suggesting a role in the preparation for childbearing.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this paper was to investigate maternal and cord blood apelin, resistin and visfatin concentrations in pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., METHODS: This case-control study was conducted on 24 women with GDM and 21 women without GDM. Maternal plasma and cord blood apelin, resistin and visfatin levels were measured with ELISA., RESULTS: The cord blood apelin levels were significantly lower in women with GDM than control subjects (111.23+/-31.53 vs.. 257.48+/-133.97 pg/mL, P=0.002). However, the decrease of maternal apelin levels in GDM group was not statistically significant (140.76+/-48.38 vs. 163.53+/-91.12 pg/mL, P=0.602). Women with GDM had lower maternal and cord blood visfatin concentrations and higher resistin concentrations than control group. Maternal resistin concentrations were significantly correlated with HOMA-IR (r=0.745, P=0.005). The apelin and visfatin levels did not correlate with HbA1c, BMI, HOMA-IR, glucose and birth weight., CONCLUSION: GDM is associated with lower cord blood apelin levels than control subjects. GDM appears to influence fetoplacental apelin metabolism. Apelin may not be directly involved in the regulation of maternal insulin sensitivity. Our results indicate that there is an increase in resistin concentrations and a decrease in visfatin concentrations in maternal serum and cord blood serum with GDM.

AB  - Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone that has a number of metabolic effects in the body, including the control of both glucose and fatty acid metabolism. The globular head domain of adiponectin, gAd, has also been shown to increase fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. Within days after birth, a rapid increase in fatty acid oxidation occurs in the heart. We examined whether adiponectin or gAd plays a role in this maturation of cardiac fatty acid oxidation. Plasma adiponectin increased in newborn rabbits following birth: 1.2 +/- 0.3 mug/ml in 1-day-old, 6.8 +/- 1.8 mug/ml in 7-day-old, and 45 +/- 5 mug/ml in 6-week-old rabbits. Because plasma insulin levels decrease and remain low throughout the suckling period, and because this decrease may contribute to the maturation of fatty acid oxidation, we examined the effects of adiponectin and gAd on fatty acid oxidation in isolated perfused 1-day-old rabbit hearts in the presence or absence of 100 microunits/ml insulin. Adiponectin (10 mug/ml) did not alter fatty acid oxidation in the presence of insulin. In the absence of insulin, the addition of recombinant gAd (1.5 mug/ml) increased fatty acid oxidation compared with control (129 +/- 18 versus 66 +/- 11 nmol.g dry weight (-1).min(-1), respectively (p < 0.05). In 7-day-old hearts, where fatty acid oxidation rates were 5-fold higher than 1-day-old hearts, gAd did not alter fatty acid oxidation rates. The increase in fatty acid oxidation in 1-day-old hearts occurred independently of changes in 5'-AMP-activated protein kinase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, or malonyl-CoA. The effect of gAd on fatty acid oxidation was reversed in the presence of 100 microunits/ml insulin. These results suggest that a decrease in plasma insulin and increase in gAd are involved in the increase of cardiac fatty acid oxidation in the immediate newborn period.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Leptin is produced by the human placenta besides adipose tissue and is suggested to be related to fetal growth. In order to find out whether multiple pregnancy is a factor affecting serum leptin levels, we compared neonatal serum leptin concentrations of twins and singleton newborns who were all appropriate for gestational age (AGA)., INFANTS AND METHODS: Thirty newborns were studied. Group 1 consisted of 15 infants from twin pregnancies and group 2 (control group) consisted of 15 infants from singleton pregnancies. Serum samples were taken at 24 hours following delivery and leptin concentrations were measured., RESULTS: There were no significant differences in birth weight, gestational age and male/female ratio between infants of twin and single gestations. However, serum leptin concentrations of twins (mean +/- SEM: 1.13 +/- 0.35 ng/ml) were significantly lower than of the singleton infants (4.27 +/- 0.63 ng/ml) (p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Twin pregnancy might be a factor affecting serum leptin concentrations in newborn infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Very low birth weight (VLBW) children have higher risk of neurologic disabilities and growth factors are essential for brain maturation., AIM: To assess whether there are differences in neurologic findings, psychometric parameters and microstructural brain morphology in 1-year-old VLBW infants versus term healthy controls and whether these differences are related to hormonal/growth changes., METHODS: Prospective anthropometry, prefeed venous blood sample [insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor-II (IGF-II), leptin, glucose], neurologic and imaging assessment, at age 1 year in 34 VLBW infants (12 SGA; 10 M) and 10 healthy term controls (5 M)., RESULTS: IGF-I concentrations at 1 month of corrected age were 20% lower in SGA versus appropriate for gestational age VLBW (p < 0.02). Gray and white matter volume and fractional anisotropy in 15/27 regions were decreased (p < 0.001). Abnormal spectroscopy was observed in 4 zones in VLBW versus term controls (p < 0.001). Some of these changes were associated with different periods of first-year growth and IGF-I/IGF-II, leptin and HOMA-IR., CONCLUSIONS: VLBW infants show differences in brain volumes and microstructural brain morphology as compared to term controls, changes related to circulating growth factor and anthropometry changes in the first year. This apparent reorganization of the developing brain offers a unique opportunity to investigate the relationship between changes in cortical anatomy, cognitive and social impairments and periods of early growth.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the relationship between fetal weight and leptin levels in maternal serum, amniotic fluid and umbilical cord., METHODS: Forty pregnant women presenting for antenatal care at early weeks of gestation were enrolled for the study. Maternal and cord blood samples for leptin measurement were obtained at birth. Amniotic fluid samples were recovered by amniotomy performed during labor. Maternal body mass index and placental weight were also recorded. Leptin measurement was carried out using the ELISA method. Spearman's correlation test was used for comparison of non-parametric data., RESULTS: Leptin concentration in venous cord blood correlated significantly with birth weight and placental weight whereas maternal serum and amniotic fluid leptin levels did not show correlation with birth weight. There were no significant correlations between leptin levels in maternal serum, cord blood and amniotic fluid., CONCLUSION: We conclude that lack of correlation between leptin levels in mother, cord and amniotic fluid suggest that these compartments may be non-communicating separate units or have different mechanisms regulating leptin synthesis or degradation, and that leptin in maternal blood and amniotic fluid may not have a direct effect on fetal growth but rather a different role in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to determine the relationship of neonatal sex and gestational diabetes mellitus on cord leptin concentration and to determine whether cord leptin has a stronger correlation with fat mass compared with birth weight or lean body mass. We hypothesized that there are no significant differences in fetal leptin concentration between male and female or between neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus and control neonates, when adjusted for body composition., STUDY DESIGN: Cord blood leptin concentrations were measured in newborn infants of 78 women (44 control neonates and 34 gestational diabetes mellitus). Of the 78 neonates, 32 babies were female, and 46 babies were male. Birth weights were measured with a calibrated scale, and body compositions were measured by total body electrical conductivity., RESULTS: Estimated mean gestational age at delivery was 39.1 +/- 1.1 weeks for control neonates versus 38.6 +/- 1.3 weeks for neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (P =.01). The fat mass for the control neonates and neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus was 0.36 +/- 0.15 kg versus 0.48 +/- 0.21 kg (P =.01); the percent body fat for the control neonates and neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus was 10.5% +/- 3.8% versus 13.2% +/- 4.3% (P =.006), respectively. There was no significant difference in cord leptin concentration between male and female neonates (16.0 +/- 13.8 ng/dL vs 12.7 +/- 12.8 ng/dL, P =.24). Cord leptin concentrations (18.1 +/- 16.2 ng/dL vs 10.9 +/- 9.5 ng/dL, P =.02) were significantly greater in neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus than in control neonates. In all subjects, cord leptin was significantly correlated with percent body fat (r = 0.51, P <.0001), fat mass (r = 0.49,P <.0001), and birth weight (r = 0.25, P =.03). After the adjustment for fat mass, there was no significant difference in cord leptin concentration between control neonates and neonates of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (P =.20), but there was a significant difference between male and female neonates (P =.04). However, when an adjustment was made for both fat mass and lean body mass, there was no longer a significant difference between male and female neonates (P =.12), CONCLUSION: The differences in cord leptin concentration between male and female neonates and between infants of women with gestational diabetes mellitus and control neonates are related to differences in body composition.

AB  - Background Few studies have examined sex-specific associations of maternal gestational glycemia with cord blood hormones, which might predict later health. Methods In 976 women without pre-existing diabetes in the Project Viva cohort, we used linear regression to examine associations of maternal gestational glycemia with cord hormone concentrations, adjusted for maternal characteristics and stratified by infant sex. Results A total of 6.1% of women had gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 8.8% isolated hyperglycemia, 3.2% gestational impaired glucose tolerance, and 81.9% were normoglycemic. In boys, compared with infants of normoglycemic mothers, infants of GDM mothers had higher cord levels of IGF-2 (beta 35.55 ng/mL; 95% CI: 2.60, 68.50), IGFBP-3 (111.2 ng/mL; 5.53, 216.8), insulin (4.66 uU/mL; 2.38, 6.95), C-peptide (0.46 ng/mL; 0.25, 0.67), and leptin (3.51 ng/mL; 1.37, 5.64), but lower IGF-1 (-6.71 ng/mL; -12.7, - 0.76, adjusted for IGFBP-3). In girls, GDM offspring had higher cord blood levels of IGF-1 adjusted for IGFBP-3 (12.45 ng/mL; 4.85, 20.04). Boys, but not girls, of mothers with abnormal glucose tolerance but not GDM also had higher levels of some hormones. Conclusion GDM was associated with growth factors and adipokines in cord blood from boys, but only IGF-1 in girls. These findings suggest sex differences in responses to fetal overnutrition.

AB  - Identifying those infants most at risk for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes is crucial to allow for targeted surveillance or preventative interventions to be instigated from birth. One intriguing possibility is to use the molecular characteristics of the placenta at birth as a 'molecular barometer' of the in utero experience to predict future infant neurodevelopmental outcomes. Here we highlight the recent advances in the field and discuss the possibilities for an integrated approach across the '-omics' categories. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Insulin is an important hormone for intrauterine growth. Irisin is an effective myokine in the regulation of physiological insulin resistance in pregnancy. Leptin and insulin are associated with fetal growth and fetal adiposity. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationships between irisin, insulin and leptin levels and maternal weight gain, as well as anthropometric measurements in the newborn., Methods: Eighty-four mothers and newborns were included in the study. Irisin, leptin and insulin levels were measured in the mothers and in cord blood. Anthropometric measurements in the newborn, maternal weight at the beginning of the pregnancy and at delivery were recorded., Results: Birth weight were classified as small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and large for gestational age (LGA). There was no difference in irisin levels among the groups. Leptin and insulin levels were found to change significantly according to birth weight (p=0.013, and p=0.012, respectively). There was a negative correlation between the anthropometric measurements of the AGA newborns and irisin levels. This correlation was not observed in SGA and LGA babies. Leptin levels were associated with fetal adiposity., Conclusion: While irisin levels are not affected by weight gain during pregnancy nor by birth weight, they show a relationship with anthropometric measurements in AGA infants. These results may lead to the understanding of metabolic disorders that will occur in later life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pre-eclampsia is a multi-systemic disease with its attendant increased maternal and perinatal morbidities and mortality. It has been hypothesized that leptin contributes immensely to the natural history of pre-eclampsia. However, there is considerable disagreement in the reports of existing research work on the link between fetomaternal serum leptin levels and pre-eclampsia., OBJECTIVE: To determine and compare the maternal and umbilical cord sera levels of leptin in women with pre-eclampsia and healthy pregnant women., STUDY DESIGN: This is an analytical cross-sectional study., METHODS: The study involved consenting 120 pregnant participants (60 on each arm). Pregnant women diagnosed with pre-eclampsia constituted the investigation group, while the controls were normotensive pregnant women. They were matched for maternal age and body mass index. Venous blood specimens were obtained from the participants for assessment of the serum leptin concentration while umbilical cord blood samples were obtained following delivery of the neonate in advance of the removal of the placenta. The collected blood samples were analysed for the levels of leptin in a blinded pattern. The primary outcome measures were maternal serum leptin levels and umbilical cord serum leptin levels., RESULTS: Mean maternal serum leptin concentration in the pre-eclampsia group was significantly higher than that in the control group (24.88 +/- 3.92 vs. 15.03 +/- 2.98ng/mL, p < 0.001). Similarly, maternal serum leptin concentration was significantly higher in participants with severe pre-eclampsia compared with those with mild pre-eclampsia (25.91 +/- 3.5 vs. 22.83 +/- 4.02ng/mL, p = 0.003). However, the mean umbilical cord serum leptin level in the pre-eclampsia group was significantly lower than in the control group (6.43 +/- 2.08 vs. 7.27 +/- 2.24; p = 0.034). There was a weak positive correlation between maternal serum leptin level and neonatal umbilical serum leptin level in the pre-eclamptic group (r = 0.21, p = 0.04)., CONCLUSION: Maternal serum leptin concentration is significantly increased in women with pre-eclampsia, compared with their normotensive counterparts. This increase becomes even more pronounced as the severity of the disease progresses. Maternal serum leptin assessment has the potential to become a veritable tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Due to their immunosuppressive properties, mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have been evaluated for the treatment of immunological diseases. However, the animal-derived growth supplements utilized for MSC manufacturing may lead to clinical complications. Characterization of alternative media formulations is imperative for MSC therapeutic application. Human BMMSC and AdMSC were expanded in media supplemented with either human platelet lysates (HPL), serum-free media/xeno-free FDA-approved culture medium (SFM/XF), or fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the effects on their properties were investigated. The immunophenotype of resting and IFN-gamma primed BMMSC and AdMSC remained unaltered in all media. Both HPL and SFM/XF increased the proliferation of BMMSC and AdMSC. Expansion of BMMSC and AdMSC in HPL increased their differentiation, compared to SFM/XF and FBS. Resting BMMSC and AdMSC, expanded in FBS or SFM/XF, demonstrated potent immunosuppressive properties in both non-primed and IFN-gamma primed conditions, whereas HPL-expanded MSC exhibited diminished immunosuppressive properties. Finally, IFN-gamma primed BMMSC and AdMSC expanded in SFM/XF and HPL expressed attenuated levels of IDO-1 compared to FBS. Herein, we provide strong evidence supporting the use of the FDA-approved SFM/XF medium, in contrast to the HPL medium, for the expansion of MSC towards therapeutic applications.

AB  - Severe intrauterine ischemia is detrimental to the developing brain. The impact of mild intrauterine hypoperfusion on neurological development, however, is still unclear. We induced mild intrauterine hypoperfusion in rats on embryonic day 17 via arterial stenosis with metal microcoils wrapped around the uterine and ovarian arteries. All pups were born with significantly decreased birth weights. Decreased gray and white matter areas were observed without obvious tissue damage. Pups presented delayed newborn reflexes, muscle weakness, and altered spontaneous activity. The levels of proteins indicative of inflammation and stress in the vasculature, i.e., RANTES, vWF, VEGF, and adiponectin, were upregulated in the placenta. The levels of mRNA for proteins associated with axon and astrocyte development were downregulated in fetal brains. The present study demonstrates that even mild intrauterine hypoperfusion can alter neurological development, which mimics the clinical signs and symptoms of children with neurodevelopmental disorders born prematurely or with intrauterine growth restriction.

AB  - AIM: Poor post-natal growth is related to later morbidity and poor cognitive development in preterm infants. We investigated the relationship between plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), leptin, active ghrelin levels and post-natal growth in preterm infants small for gestational age (SGA)., METHODS: Plasma IGF-1, leptin and active ghrelin levels were measured at birth and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after birth in 42 very low birthweight (VLBW) infants (born between 27 and 31 weeks of gestation), including 14 SGA infants with extrauterine growth restriction (EUGR), 6 SGA infants without EUGR and 22 appropriate-for-gestational-age infants., RESULTS: At birth, IGF-1 levels in SGA infants without EUGR did not differ significantly from those in SGA infants with EUGR. However, IGF-1 levels in SGA infants without EUGR were as high as those observed in appropriate-for-gestational-age infants and were significantly different from those in SGA infants with EUGR at 4 and 8 weeks of age. Leptin and ghrelin levels did not differ significantly among the three groups at any time point., CONCLUSION: IGF-1 is related to catch-up growth in SGA VLBW infants during neonatal intensive care unit admission; however, this does not appear to be the case for leptin and ghrelin. IGF-1 level monitoring may be useful for predicting EUGR in preterm VLBW infants. Copyright © 2016 Paediatrics and Child Health Division (The Royal Australasian College of Physicians).

AB  - AIM: We investigated the relationship between plasma insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), leptin, active ghrelin levels, and postnatal growth in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants., METHOD: Plasma IGF-I, leptin, and active ghrelin levels were measured at birth and at 2, 4, 6 and 8 weeks after birth in 61 VLBW infants, including 31 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) and 30 small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants., RESULTS: Insulin-like growth factor I levels were the lowest at birth, but increased gradually over the first 8 weeks of life. IGF-I was positively correlated with body weight, body length and body mass index at all time points. Leptin levels did not change over the study period. Ghrelin levels were significantly lower at birth; however, there were no significant differences between the levels after 2 weeks of age. Leptin and ghrelin levels were not correlated with anthropometrical measures. IGF-I levels at birth were significantly lower in SGA than in AGA infants, but the leptin and ghrelin levels were not significantly different between the two groups., CONCLUSION: Insulin-like growth factor I is related to length and weight gain in the prenatal and the early postnatal periods in VLBW infants, but this does not appear to be the case for leptin and ghrelin.

AB  - This study investigates the relationship between leptin and fetal bone metabolism by measuring fetal blood levels of leptin, carboxy-terminal pro-peptide of type I pro-collagen (PICP; a marker of bone formation) and cross-linked carboxy-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP; a marker of bone resorption). The median gestational age at the time of sampling was 23 weeks (range, 18-35). There was a positive correlation between leptin concentration and gestational age (r = 0.543, P < 0.001) and a negative correlation between both PICP and ICTP and gestational age (r = -0.592 and r = -0.550, respectively, and P < 0.001 for both). Also, there was a negative correlation between the concentrations of leptin and both PICP (r = -0.260, P = 0.022) and ICTP (r = -0.622, P < 0.001). Using multiple regression analysis, fetal leptin concentration was positively correlated to the gestational age (r = 0.240, P = 0.042) and negatively correlated to ICTP (r = -0.420, P = 0.001). The increase in leptin concentration with gestational age is consistent with adipose tissue development and the subsequent accumulation of fat mass. The negative correlation between fetal leptin and ICTP suggests that leptin may decrease bone resorption with the overall effect of increasing bone mass. Therefore, leptin may play a role in fetal bone metabolism as part of its effect on fetal growth and development.

AB  - AIMS: To compare cord blood concentrations of total adiponectin in the offspring of pregnancies with and without preeclampsia., METHODS: Using a Luminex analyzer, cord blood adiponectin was measured in 182 singleton pregnancies with preeclampsia and compared to adiponectin measured in 511 singleton pregnancies without preeclampsia., RESULTS: Adiponectin levels in cord blood increased with increasing gestational age, but overall, crude levels were similar in pregnancies with and without preeclampsia. However, in pregnancies with early delivery (weeks 32-36), and in pregnancies with delivery after spontaneous contractions, adiponectin levels were higher in the preeclampsia group., CONCLUSION: In preterm pregnancies and in pregnancies with spontaneous contractions, adiponectin levels in cord blood were higher in the preeclampsia group than in pregnancies without preeclampsia, maybe reflecting the need to optimize energy in preeclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to compare umbilical cord plasma leptin between infants of mothers who experienced preeclampsia and infants of control subjects and to study the relation between cord plasma leptin and infant obesity, as indicated by ponderal index., STUDY DESIGN: On the basis of a population of approximately 13,000 deliveries, we compared cord plasma leptin from preeclamptic (n = 256 women) and control pregnancies (n = 607 women) after taking the differences in gestational age and ponderal index into account., RESULTS: Cord plasma leptin increased strongly with gestational age, both in the preeclampsia group and the control subjects (P <.01), but at each gestational age the preeclampsia group had higher leptin levels than control subjects (P <.01). Adjustment for the higher ponderal index among control subjects (P <.05) did not alter the difference in leptin levels between the groups., CONCLUSION: We found higher levels of umbilical cord plasma leptin in infants of mothers who had preeclampsia (compared with infants of control subjects) after adjusting for differences in gestational age, gender, and infant ponderal index.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study is the first to report high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin in newborns from normal and pre-eclamptic pregnancies (PE). Adiponectin is adversely related to Metabolic Syndrome-linked diseases such as obesity, dyslipidaemia, insulin resistance and hypertension. It is abundant in human plasma where it circulates as several characteristic multimeric forms of which the HMW form is the most active. As children from PE-pregnancies have a greater susceptibility to hypertensive disorders later in life, we hypothesized that adiponectin measured in cord blood could be a putative risk marker., DESIGN AND PATIENTS: Cross-sectional, hospital-based study of newborns from mothers with pre-eclampsia (30 cases and 62 controls). Venous cord blood samples were collected immediately after birth and were analysed for total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin., MEASUREMENTS: Total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin were measured by commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits., RESULTS: The PE newborns showed a significantly lower gestational age (GA), total adiponectin and HMW adiponectin levels than the controls. No differences in adiponectin levels were found between case and control groups when correcting for GA. In combined groups, log (total adipo) = 0.40 + 0.027*GA; r = 0.43, P < 0.001. Furthermore, the HMW form is the dominant form of adiponectin: HMW adipo = -5.06 + 0.81*total adipo; r = 0.90, P < 0.001., CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin in cord blood from PE pregnancies may not be a tentative risk marker for Metabolic Syndrome-linked diseases. HMW adiponectin is the dominant form of adiponectin in cord blood. Its role during pregnancy and postnatal life should be further explored.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether cord sera leptin and components of the somatotropin axis - growth hormone (GH), total (t) and free (f) insulin-like growth factor (IGF), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and insulin - correlate with birth weight., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study of 22 newborns, 12 with normal birth weight (NBW) and 10 with low birth weight (LBW), in a population of healthy mothers with an apparent normal pregnancy., METHODS: Paired mother-neonate blood samples were obtained at vaginal delivery in order to measure leptin and the somatotropin axis components., RESULTS: In all cases maternal blood concentrations of leptin, t and fIGF-I, its carrier protein IGFBP-3, and insulin were higher than in the cord sera of the newborns, regardless of their birth weight. On the contrary, maternal GH levels were lower than in their neonates. LBW neonates had decreased levels of leptin, tIGF-I, and IGFBP-3 as compared with those levels in NBW offspring; however, GH concentrations were higher in LBW neonates. Birth weight showed a significant correlation with cord sera leptin, tIGF-I, IGFBP-3, and GH; nevertheless birth weight was neither interrelated with fIGF-I nor with insulin levels., CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that birth weight is significantly correlated with both leptin and some components of the somatotropin axis; on the other hand, no correlation was observed between leptin concentrations and each one of the components of the somatotropin axis. It is suggested that fetal leptin and the somatotropin axis cooperate in intrauterine growth and birth weight. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - Introduction: Over fifty percent of women entering pregnancy are overweight or obese. This has a significant impact on short and long term maternal and infant health outcomes, and the intergenerational effects of obesity are now a major public health problem globally. Areas covered: There are two major pathways contributing to fetal growth. Glucose and insulin directly affect growth, while other substrates such as leptin, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factors indirectly influence growth through structural and morphological effects on the placenta, uteroplacental blood flow, and regulation of placental transporters. Advances in ultrasonography over the past decade have led to interest in the prediction of the fetus at risk of overgrowth and adiposity utilizing both standard ultrasound biometry and fetal body composition measurements. However, to date there is no consensus regarding the definition of fetal overgrowth, its reporting, and clinical management. Expert commentary: Maternal dietary intervention targeting the antenatal period appear to be too late to sufficiently affect fetal growth. The peri-conceptual period and early pregnancy are being evaluated to determine if the intergenerational effects of maternal obesity can be altered to improve newborn, infant and child health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perinatal environmental factors have been associated with the metabolic programming of children and consequent disease risks in later life. Epigenetic modifications that lead to altered gene expression may be involved. Here, we study early life environmental and constitutional factors in association with the DNA methylation of leptin (LEP), a non-imprinted gene implicated in appetite regulation and fat metabolism., METHODS: We investigated maternal education, breastfeeding, and constitutional factors of the child at 17 mo of age. We measured the DNA methylation of LEP in whole blood and the concentration of leptin in serum., RESULTS: Duration of breastfeeding was negatively associated with LEP methylation. Low education (<=12 y of education) was associated with higher LEP methylation. Boys had higher birth weight and lower LEP methylation than girls. An inverse association was established between birth weight per SD increase (+584 g) and LEP methylation. High BMI and leptin concentration were associated with lower methylation of LEP., CONCLUSION: The early life environment and constitutional factors of the child are associated with epigenetic variations in LEP. Future studies must reveal whether breastfeeding and the associated decrease in LEP methylation is an epigenetic mechanism contributing to the protective effect of breastfeeding against obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The chitinase-like protein YKL-40 is involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling. We recently showed that serum YKL-40 levels were elevated in patients with asthma and were correlated with severity, thickening of the subepithelial basement membrane, and pulmonary function. We hypothesized that single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that affect YKL-40 levels also influence asthma status and lung function., METHODS: We carried out a genomewide association study of serum YKL-40 levels in a founder population of European descent, the Hutterites, and then tested for an association between an implicated SNP and asthma and lung function. One associated variant was genotyped in a birth cohort at high risk for asthma, in which YKL-40 levels were measured from birth through 5 years of age, and in two populations of unrelated case patients of European descent with asthma and controls., RESULTS: A promoter SNP (-131C-->G) in CHI3L1, the chitinase 3-like 1 gene encoding YKL-40, was associated with elevated serum YKL-40 levels (P=1.1 x 10(-13)), asthma (P=0.047), bronchial hyperresponsiveness (P=0.002), and measures of pulmonary function (P=0.046 to 0.002) in the Hutterites. The same SNP could be used to predict the presence of asthma in the two case-control populations (combined P=1.2 x 10(-5)) and serum YKL-40 levels at birth (in cord-blood specimens) through 5 years of age in the birth cohort (P=8.9 x 10(-3) to 2.5 x 10(-4))., CONCLUSIONS: CHI3L1 is a susceptibility gene for asthma, bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and reduced lung function, and elevated circulating YKL-40 levels are a biomarker for asthma and decline in lung function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast milk is known to contain many bioactive hormones and peptides, which can influence infant growth and development. In this context, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of different clinical pregnancy conditions on hormone concentrations in colostrum and mature breast milk., METHODS: An observational study was performed with mother-newborn pairs divided into five groups according to maternal clinical background: diabetes (12), hypertension (5), smoking (19), intrauterine growth restriction of unknown causes with small-for-gestational-age newborns at delivery (12), and controls (21). Socioeconomic data, anthropometric measurements and breast milk samples were collected between the first 24 and 48 h and 30 days postpartum. Leptin, adiponectin, and insulin levels in breast milk were measured by immunoassays., RESULTS: A significant decrease in leptin (p = 0.050) and insulin (p = 0.012) levels from colostrum to mature breast milk in mothers of small-for-gestational-age infants was observed. Maternal body mass index was correlated with both leptin and insulin, but not with adiponectin. Insulin levels were negatively correlated to infant weight gain from birth to one month (p = 0.050). In addition, catch-up growth was verified for small-for-gestational-age infants throughout the first month of life., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that a remarkable decrease in leptin and insulin levels in mature milk of mothers of small-for-gestational-age newborns may be involved in the rapid weight gain of these newborns. The physiological and external mechanisms by which these significant decreases and rapid weight gains occur in this group remain to be elucidated.

AB  - Introduction: The approach to the physiology of pregnancy based on adipokine behavior and the homeostasis-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) model, along with their relationship to neonatal weight, has been poorly studied in adolescent pregnant women. Objective: To determine possible correlations between adipokines -leptin and adiponectin- and HOMA-IR in pregnant women aged 14 to 17 years, and first-trimester body mass index (BMI) and neonatal weight. Materials and methods: In the weeks 11 to 14 of gestation, the biochemical variables leptin, adiponectin, glycemia and insulin were measured and HOMA-IR was calculated. Maternal and neonatal anthropometric variables were obtained. Statistical analysis was performed with Pearson correlation and the p value. Results: We noticed a positive correlation of serum leptin levels with HOMA-IR in the first trimester of gestation (r=0.5, p<=0.000) and a negative correlation between adiponectin and HOMA-IR (r=-0.4; p=0.017), along with positive correlations between BMI and leptin, insulin and HOMA-IR (r=0.83 and p <0.000, r=0.56 and p<=0.000; r=0.54 and p<=0.000, respectively). In adolescent non-obese mothers with no history of dyslipidemia, there was a positive correlation between HOMA-IR and neonatal weight (r=0.43, p=0.012). Conclusions: Leptin and HOMA-IR showed a positive correlation, while adiponectin and HOMA-IR showed a negative correlation. Leptin and HOMA-IR were positively correlated with BMI. HOMA-IR correlated with the weight of neonates of non-obese adolescents without dyslipidemia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Time to onset of stage II lactogenesis varies widely, and delayed onset of lactogenesis (OL) is common among first-time mothers in the United States. Higher body mass index, older age, and larger infant birth weight are identified risk factors for delayed OL; all are known correlates with glucose metabolism. Our objective was to prenatally assess maternal biomarkers related to metabolic health and determine the extent to which these biomarkers predict timing of OL., METHODS: We enrolled a population-based sample of expectant primiparas attending a single prenatal clinic. We obtained a blood sample 1-hour post-glucose load from an antenatal oral glucose challenge test and assayed for the following biomarkers: serum insulin, glucose, adiponectin, leptin, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6, resistin, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Our outcome measure was timing of OL, based on maternal report at 3-5 days postpartum. We used linear regression to model OL hour., RESULTS: Twenty-six of 29 (90%) agreed to screening, 18 delivered at term and initiated breastfeeding, and 16 have complete data. Median (minimum-maximum) postpartum body mass index was 27.4 (21.8-34.7) kg/m(2), and median time to OL was 64 (10-121) hours. The model, OL = 232 - 34.9(ln[ratio insulin/glucose]) - 1.4(adiponectin), explained 56% of the variation in OL hour (p = 0.005) and was not weakened by potential confounders., CONCLUSIONS: Higher serum insulin secretion relative to serum glucose after a glucose challenge and higher serum adiponectin are associated with earlier onset of OL. These findings suggest that factors associated with better glucose tolerance predict earlier OL.

AB  - Among women, the polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is considered a form of metabolic syndrome with reproductive abnormalities. Women with PCOS show increased sympathetic tone, visceral adiposity with enlarged adipocytes, hypoadiponectinemia, insulin resistance, glucose intolerance, increased inactive osteocalcin, and hypertension. Excess fetal exposure to androgens has been hypothesized to play a role in the pathogenesis of PCOS. Previously, we showed that neonatal exposure to the androgen testosterone (NT) programs leptin resistance in adult female mice. Here, we studied the impact of NT on lean and adipose tissues, sympathetic tone in cardiometabolic tissues, and the development of metabolic dysfunction in mice. Neonatally androgenized adult female mice (NTF) displayed masculinization of lean tissues with increased cardiac and skeletal muscle as well as kidney masses. NTF mice showed increased and dysfunctional white adipose tissue with increased sympathetic tone in both visceral and subcutaneous fat as well as increased number of enlarged and insulin-resistant adipocytes that displayed altered expression of developmental genes and hypoadiponectinemia. NTF exhibited dysfunctional brown adipose tissue with increased mass and decreased energy expenditure. They also displayed decreased undercarboxylated and active osteocalcin and were predisposed to obesity during chronic androgen excess. NTF showed increased renal sympathetic tone associated with increased blood pressure, and they developed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance. Thus, developmental exposure to testosterone in female mice programs features of cardiometabolic dysfunction, as can be observed in women with PCOS, including increased sympathetic tone, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance, prediabetes, and hypertension.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to describe the predictive factors of severe obesity in children followed in French Guiana., METHODS: In this observational study, the patients from the French Guianese Childhood Obesity Group database were prospectively included, after giving a statement of patient's non opposition., RESULTS: Our group classifications revealed that 36 of 150 (24%) participants were classified as being metabolically abnormal obesity" (MAO), while 114 of 150 (76%) were categorized as metabolically normal obesity" (MNO). MAO-patients were older. Their mothers had more severe obesity. We also observed that their systolic blood pressure was higher. The median Z-score BMI of children with MAO was 4, 9 [4, 05-5, 38], which shows a more obese condition than the MNO group. The median waist-to-height ratio (WTHR) of our study population was high, either 0.63 [0.54-0.59]. No significant differences in the term of pregnancy, father's obesity, gender, birth weight, feeding, diastolic blood pressure and WTHR were found between the two groups. The predictors of MAO status, after adjusting for age and sex, were mother's obesity and high child's waist circumference. Among the comorbidity, there were two Down syndrome, one Cornelia de Lange syndrome, one Nephrotic Syndrome and one Epilepsy. The leptin hormone and insulin levels were higher in MAO than in MNO, while 25-OH D-vitamin was higher in MNO., CONCLUSION: This study indicates the need to incorporate waist circumference into routine clinical practice, in addition to traditional measures of weight, height, body mass index and waist-to-height ratio.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin has been shown to be inversely related to birth weight in schoolchildren and adolescents. However, the available information regarding a relation between birth size and adiponectin in infants and preschoolers is limited., METHODS: A longitudinal study was conducted among healthy Japanese children, and serum adiponectin levels were measured at consecutive visits. The effect of sex, gestational age, birth length, birth weight, or placental weight on adiponectin was analyzed by using a linear mixed model for repeated measures., RESULTS: Eighty-three children were evaluated. The age range at the first visit was 0.07-5.3 years. A total number of 227 measurements were made, 1-12 per subject (median, 3) and the duration of follow-up ranged from 1 day to 2.3 years (median, 1.0 years). The subjects were divided into four groups according to the age at the first visit: (1) 0-2 months (n = 29), (2) 3 months to 1 year (n = 17), (3) 2-3 years (n = 19) and (4) 4-5 years (n = 18). In the multivariate model, birth length (coefficient = 3.94, 95% CI, 0.23-7.65) was an independent predictor of serum adiponectin levels in subjects aged 0-2 months. Gestational age (3.53, 1.14-5.92), birth length (-2.71, -4.90 to -0.53) and placental weight (2.58, 0.86-4.29) were independent predictors of serum adiponectin levels in subjects aged 4-5 years., CONCLUSION: Birth length, not birth weight, is an independent predictor of serum adiponectin levels in Japanese young children.

AB  - Neurotransmitter-mediated acupuncture analgesia has been widely studied in nervous systems. It remains largely unclear if peripheral substances are involved the acupuncture analgesia. Adiponectin (APN), a circulating adipokine, shows analgesic effects. The study aimed to examine whether APN regulates analgesic effects of electroacupuncture (EA) in the complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced mouse model. APN wild type (WT) and knockout (KO) mouse were employed in the study. We found that EA attenuates the CFA-induced pain as demonstrated by the Hargreaves thermal test and the von Frey filament test. The deletion of APN significantly reduced the acupuncture analgesia in the CFA-treated APN KO mice while the intrathecal administration of APN mimicked the analgesic effects of EA. We further revealed that EA produced analgesic effects mainly via APN/ AdipoR2-mediated AMPK pathway by the siRNA inhibitions of APN receptors (adipoR1/2) in the spinal cord. The immunofluorescence staining analysis showed that EA increased the APN accumulation in spinal cord through the blood circulation. In conclusion, the study indicates a novel mechanism that acupuncture produces analgesic effects at least partially via APN/AdipoR2-AMPK pathway in the spinal cord.

AB  - BACKGROUND: C-peptide offers potential as a marker to indicate childhood metabolic outcomes. Measuring C-peptide concentration might have better future utility in the risk stratification of neonates born to overweight or diabetic mothers. Prior research has tried to bring this matter into the light; however, the clinical significance of these associations is still far from reach. Here we sought to investigate the associations between fetomaternal metabolic variables and umbilical cord blood C-peptide concentration., METHODS: For the present study, 858 pregnant women were randomly selected from among a sub-group of 35,430 Iranian pregnant women who participated in a randomized community non-inferiority trial of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) screening. Their umbilical cord (UC) blood C-peptide concentrations were measured, and the pregnancy variables of macrosomia/large for gestational age (LGA) and primary cesarean section (CS) delivery were assessed. The variation of C-peptide concentrations among GDM and macrosomia status was plotted. Due to the skewed distribution of C-peptide concentration in the sample, median regression analysis was used to identify potential factors related to UC C-peptide concentration., RESULTS: In the univariate model, positive GDM status was associated with a 0.3 (95% CI: 0.06 - 0.54, p = 0.01) increase in the median coefficient of UC blood C-peptide concentration. Moreover, one unit (kg) increase in the birth weight was associated with a 0.25 (95% CI: 0.03 - 0.47, p = 0.03) increase in the median coefficient of UC blood C-peptide concentration. In the multivariate model, after adjusting for maternal age, maternal BMI, and macrosomia status, the positive status of GDM and macrosomia were significantly associated with an increase in the median coefficient of UC blood C-peptide concentration (Coef.= 0.27, 95% CI: 0.13 - 0.42, p < 0.001; and Coef.= 0.34, 95% CI: 0.06 - 0.63, p = 0.02, respectively)., CONCLUSION: UC blood concentration of C-peptide is significantly associated with the incidence of maternal GDM and neonatal macrosomia. Using stratification for maternal BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) and investigating molecular markers like Leptin and IGF-1 in the future might lay the ground to better understand the link between metabolic disturbances of pregnancy and UC blood C-peptide concentration.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review what is understood about the pathophysiology of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the diagnostic challenges of PCOS in adolescent women, associated risk factors, as well as the best evidence-based treatment options for adolescence., RECENT FINDINGS: Diagnosing PCOS in adolescents requires a unique set of criteria for which no single marker currently exists. Adolescents at high risk for developing the syndrome are congenital virilization, low birth weight, premature pubarche, central precocious puberty, large for gestational age girls born to overweight mothers, obesity syndromes, insulin-resistant features, and girls born to parents with PCOS, central obesity, or diabetes in whom PCOS ought to be suspected when associated with irregular menses. Insulin, hyperandrogenemia, and adipocytokines are integral players in the pathophysiology of PCOS. PCOS may be an inheritable trait; however, no gene has yet been identified. Quality of life remains a concern for young women with PCOS. Lifestyle modifications geared to prevent long-term sequelae remain the first-line treatment in conjunction with oral contraceptive pills., SUMMARY: Identifying PCOS in adolescents remains a diagnostic dilemma, but early intervention and treatment can improve long-term health.

AB  - Impaired glucose homeostasis is one of the most common causes of death in the U.S. The progressive global epidemic of obesity makes it a major causal factor for pre-diabetes and type 2 diabetes, which may represent the two categories of impaired glucose regulation. Recognition of the importance of black white contrast in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus has stirred up interest in its potential role in the development and progression of diabetes. Accumulating evidence suggests that multiple cardiometabolic risk factors such as insulin resistance/hyperinsulinemia, adiposity, genetic predisposition, low birth weight, prepuberty, inflammation markers including C-reactive protein and adiponectin, chronic kidney dysfunction, and environmental and socio-economic status lead to the black-white divergence in type 2 diabetes. Early prevention and intervention for these risk factors, especially obesity and altered lifestyles involving physical activity and dietary consumption, may help to neutralize the racial disparities seen in the emerging epidemic of diabetes beginning in youth.

AB  - AIMS: This study aimed to investigate (i) the plasma ghrelin concentration at birth, (ii) the relationship of ghrelin with metabolic hormones, including leptin and insulin, and (iii) its association with anthropometric parameters, in appropriately grown preterm (23-36 weeks gestation) and term (37-42 weeks gestation) newborns., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Blood samples for hormonal assay were obtained from preterm (n = 81) and term newborns (n = 40) within the first 2 h of life and before milk feeding or energy intake. The relationship between plasma ghrelin and other metabolic hormones or anthropometric parameters was evaluated., RESULTS: Plasma ghrelin was detectable in all studied infants and the concentrations did not differ significantly between term and preterm infants [median (interquartile range): 1.21 (0.86-1.48) nmol/l vs. 1.04 (0.71-1.51) nmol/l, P = 0.52, respectively]. There was no overall significant correlation between plasma ghrelin and gestational age, anthropometric parameters and leptin or insulin. However, when term and preterm infants were analysed independently, plasma ghrelin was inversely correlated with birth weight (r = -0.31, P = 0.05) and body length (r = -0.33, P = 0.04) in the term infant group., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that plasma ghrelin concentrations were relatively constant at birth, between 23 and 42 weeks gestation, and ghrelin secretion did not appear to undergo gestational age-related variations. An inverse relationship between plasma ghrelin and anthropometric indices in term infants raised the possibility that ghrelin might adopt its physiological role in regulating growth and metabolism at a late stage of gestation (> or = 37 weeks gestation). This phenomenon could be beneficial to term newborns by stimulating their appetite and maintaining an adequate blood sugar level at the most critical period when nutrients from mothers are abruptly terminated after birth.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate 1) the plasma resistin concentration at birth, 2) the relationship of resistin with leptin and insulin, and 3) the association of resistin with anthropometric indexes in newborn infants. Blood samples for hormonal assay were obtained from preterm and term newborns within the first 2 h of life and before milk feeding or energy intake. Although these infants required blood sampling for clinical reasons, all were proved to be noninfected. Plasma resistin was significantly higher in term than in preterm infants. It was also significantly correlated with serum leptin, and both hormones were significantly associated with gestational age and anthropometric indexes. Infants who were born vaginally were found to have significantly higher plasma resistin levels compared with those who were born by cesarean section. In the multivariate forward stepwise regression models, resistin was found to be significantly associated with the mode of delivery and gestational age or birth weight. The association among resistin, leptin, and anthropometric indexes suggested that both hormones might be gestation related. A high circulating resistin level at term gestation could be advantageous to the infant by promoting hepatic glucose production and preventing hypoglycemia after birth. Infants who were born vaginally had significantly higher plasma resistin levels, suggesting that this hormone might also be associated with stress or inflammation induced by the birth process.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate 1) the effect of maternal diabetes mellitus on ghrelin, resistin, leptin, and insulin in term newborns; 2) the interrelationship of these metabolic hormones in the early postnatal period; and 3) the association of the hormones with anthropometric parameters at birth. A total of 120 term newborns were prospectively enrolled and categorized into three groups: 40 were infants of nondiabetic mothers (group N), 42 were infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes on low energy dietary treatment (group D), and 38 were infants born to mothers with preexisting or severe gestational diabetes who required exogenous insulin for stabilization of blood sugar during pregnancy (group I). Plasma ghrelin and resistin were significantly lower in group I than in either group N or group D infants (P < 0.048). Plasma ghrelin and subscapular skinfold thickness were significantly higher in female than in male infants [plasma ghrelin: median (interquartile range), 3.8 (3.0-4.8) vs. 3.0 (2.4-4.0) ng/ml in females and males, respectively; P = 0.003; subscapular skinfold thickness: 4.9 (4.2-5.6) vs. 4.6 (3.9-5.2) mm; P = 0.03]. In group N, plasma ghrelin was significantly, but negatively, associated with birth weight (r = -0.31; P = 0.05) and body length (r = -0.33; P = 0.04), whereas in group I, plasma ghrelin was negatively correlated with plasma resistin (r = -0.37; P = 0.02). Plasma ghrelin and resistin are suppressed in infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers, suggesting that the metabolic hormonal system is probably operational in fetal and early postnatal life. A low circulating ghrelin concentration may be advantageous to these infants, because a reduction in appetite may prevent excessive weight gain postnatally and counterbalances the in utero anabolic effect of hyperinsulinism in poorly controlled diabetic mothers. The suppressive effect of insulin on resistin may partially explain the excess accumulation of adipose tissue in infants of diabetic mothers by reducing the inhibitory effect of resistin on adipogenesis. Female infants have significantly higher plasma ghrelin levels than male infants, suggesting that sexual dimorphism exists in utero. This study has also shown an association between some of the metabolic hormones in specific groups of infants and thus suggests that these hormones could have interacted in utero to regulate growth and fat storage during this critical period.

AB  - UNLABELLED: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of postnatal systemic dexamethasone on serum leptin, insulin and hormones of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in preterm, very low birthweight (VLBW) infants. Nineteen VLBW infants who received a 3 wk dose tapering course of dexamethasone for treatment of bronchopulmonary dysplasia were prospectively enrolled. Blood for hormone assays was collected immediately before the start of the dexamethasone course (T(d-per)), 3 wk after commencement of the drug (T(d-end)) and 2 wk after dexamethasone treatment had been stopped (T(d-post)). In addition, 28 VLBW infants who participated in a concurrent longitudinal leptin study within the same period but did not receive corticosteroid had their serum leptin and insulin concentrations serially monitored. Blood specimens for the latter group of infants were obtained at 2 (T(wk-2)), 5 (T(wk-5)) and 7 (T(wk-7)) wk of postnatal age. Serum leptin and insulin at T(d-end) were significantly increased, whereas plasma ACTH and serum cortisol were significantly suppressed compared with the pretreatment (T(d-pre)) levels in the corticosteroid group (p < 0.0001 for leptin and insulin; p < 0.05 and p < 0.001 for ACTH and cortisol, respectively). In contrast, serum leptin and insulin at weeks 5 (T(wk-5)) and 7 (T(wk-7)) did not differ significantly from their respective levels at week 2 (T(wk-2)) in the non-treatment group., CONCLUSION: The administration of systemic corticosteroid resulted in significant increases in serum leptin and insulin, but marked suppression of hormones of the HPA axis. The effect of dexamethasone on the "adipoinsular" and HPA axes was transient and reversible. The adipoinsular axis in preterm infants is likely to be functional and active at an early stage of human development, and leptin may regulate energy balance in VLBW infants in the early postnatal period. Corticosteroids may, through the adipoinsular axis or its associated pathways, mediate in the regulation of body weight in preterm neonates.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Very little is known concerning the physiological role of leptin and growth in the early postnatal period and the association of leptin with other metabolic hormones in preterm infants. This study aims to investigate these relationships, and to explore the longitudinal and dynamic profile of leptin and metabolic hormones including insulin, ACTH, cortisol and FT4 in this category of patient. We also postulate that a rapid increase in body weight and body mass index in the first few weeks of life may be associated with a corresponding increase in serum leptin if the 'adipoinsular axis' is active at this stage., DESIGN: A longitudinal study in a cohort of preterm infants < 34 weeks gestation for the first five weeks of postnatal life., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-one preterm newborns < 34 weeks gestation were prospectively enrolled. Blood samples were collected in the morning when the newborns were 24 h of age (day 1), and on days 5, 14 and 35 of life. Serum leptin, insulin, cortisol, FT4, glucose and plasma ACTH concentrations were analysed using standard biochemical methods. Spearman's correlation coefficient was used to assess the inter-relationship of different metabolic hormones on the first day of life, and the relationship between metabolic hormones on day 1 and anthropometric or clinical parameters. The mixed-effects models were further used for analysing the multiple longitudinal measurements, and also for comparing the hormone concentrations between day 1 (baseline) and their corresponding levels on days 5, 14 and 35., RESULTS: Serum leptin on day 1 (baseline) was significantly associated with serum insulin (r = 0.30, P < 0.05) and insulin:glucose ratio (r = 0.29, P < 0.05) in infants < 34 weeks gestation. Female preterm infants had significantly higher serum leptin (P < 0.05) and insulin (P < 0.05) levels than male infants. In addition, the duration between the last dose of antenatal dexamethasone and delivery significantly influenced the serum concentrations of leptin (r = - 0.27, P < 0.05), cortisol (r = 0.52, P < 0.001), plasma ACTH (r = 0.28, P < 0.05) and insulin:glucose ratio (r = - 0.27, P < 0.05) on the first day of life. Despite significant increase in body weight (P < 0.00001) and body mass index (P < 0.00001) by day 35 when compared to birth weight, no corresponding significant changes were observed for serum leptin, insulin and FT4. However, there was an increasing though statistically nonsignificant trend in serum leptin after day 14 of life., CONCLUSION: This study characterized the longitudinal profile of leptin and metabolic hormones in preterm infants < 34 weeks gestation in the first 5 weeks of life. Serum leptin was significantly associated with serum insulin and insulin:glucose ratio supporting the hypothesis that an 'adipoinsular axis' exists and is likely to be functional before 34 weeks of gestation. Although a significant increase in body weight was demonstrated by day 35, no significant corresponding changes occurred with regard to serum leptin. We postulate that the limited quantity of adipose tissue at this stage of development might have contributed to this observation. Moreover, our results also showed that the duration between the last dose of antenatal corticosteroid and delivery could influence the postnatal concentrations of adipoinsular and pituitary-adrenal hormones. Thus, it is possible that antenatal dexamethasone might affect fetal growth and development via these neuroendocrine pathways in early intrauterine life.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the effect of maternal diabetes on leptin in term newborns and to determine whether leptin correlates with insulin and its associated biochemical parameters in support of the hypothesis that a functional "adipoinsular axis" might exist at this stage of development., METHODS: A total of 116 term newborns were prospectively enrolled and categorised into three groups: 44 were infants of non-diabetic mothers (control group C); 41 were infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes on dietary treatment (group D); and 31 were infants born to mothers with gestational or pregestational diabetes on insulin treatment (group I)., RESULTS: No significant difference in serum leptin was observed between the three groups; the results of the study population were therefore pooled and analysed. Serum leptin correlated significantly with serum insulin, insulin:glucose ratio, birth weight, body length, body mass index, placenta weight, and maternal HbA(1c). Female infants had significantly higher serum leptin than male infants. All parameters except placenta weight and body length remained significantly associated with serum leptin when multivariate stepwise regression analysis was applied. Subgroup analysis revealed a significant correlation between serum leptin and cortisol in group D., CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in serum leptin between infants born to diabetic and non-diabetic mothers, though infants born to mothers requiring insulin treatment had the highest median serum leptin concentrations. The significant association between serum leptin and insulin or insulin:glucose ratio supports the hypothesis that a functional adipoinsular axis might exist in term newborns. Furthermore, the significant correlation between maternal HbA(1c) and circulating leptin of the studied infants suggests that the clinical control of maternal diabetes could affect the regulation of serum leptin in these infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the role of endothelin-1 (ET-1) and leptin in intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) among preeclamptic and non-pre-eclamptic women., METHODS: Forty three patients with a pregnancy complicated by IUGR, 23 cases with severe pre-eclampsia and 20 cases of non-pre-eclamptic were enrolled. Control group comprised 15 cases with uncomplicated pregnancy. Blood samples from umbilical artery and maternal venous blood were collected at the time of delivery for analysis of ET-1 and leptin levels. Mode of delivery, birth weight and Apgar score were also recorded., RESULTS: The mean maternal and fetal ET-1 level was significantly higher in pregnancies complicated by IUGR than in control group. The mean maternal leptin level was significantly higher in pre-eclamptic patients when compared to non-preeclamptic and control groups. Mean fetal leptin level was significantly lower in patients compared to control; however, when fetal leptin corrected to fetal weight, it was insignificantly different in the both groups. E-mail: m. alhaggar@yahoo.co.uk., CONCLUSION: Maternal plasma ET-1 and leptin correlate with the degree of fetal growth restriction originating from deterioration of placental function. Maternal plasma leptin and ET-1 levels may reflect deterioration in fetal growth.

AB  - This study aimed at evaluating the levels of different maternal exercise intensities on maternal and fetal outcomes. Wistar rats were mated and the pregnant rats were distributed into four experimental groups (n = 13 animals/group): Control (Not exercise group - 0% of the anaerobic threshold- AT), mild (20%), moderate (80%), and heavy-exercise intensity (140% of AT). These AT were matched to the load of 0, 1, 4 and 7% of the body weight of the animal related to swimming-induced physical intensity. In pregnancy, biomarkers related to maternal blood gases, oxidative stress, metabolism, and reproductive performance, and outcomes of their offspring were analyzed. The mild and moderate-swimming caused no change on implantation, live fetus numbers and oxidative stress status. However, the rats submitted to mild-exercise presented respiratory alkalosis and the heavy-exercise group showed respiratory acidosis. In addition, fetuses of the heavy-exercise dams were smaller for gestational age and lower serum adiponectin levels compared to those of other groups. In conclusion, the moderate-exercise intensity caused beneficial effects for maternal environment and the mild and moderate-exercise presented similar fetal repercussions. Nevertheless, the heavy-exercise intensity caused maternal metabolic alterations that damaged the fetal growth. Therefore, these findings confirm that physical intensity should be carefully conducted to avoid maternal complications and, consequently, compromised fetal repercussions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Alteration of placental structure may influence fetal overgrowth and complications of maternal diabetes. We examined the placenta in a cohort of offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes (OT1DM) to assess structural changes and determine whether these were related to maternal A1C, fetal hematocrit, fetal hormonal, or metabolic axes., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Placental samples were analyzed using stereological techniques to quantify volumes and surface areas of key placental components in 88 OT1DM and 39 control subjects, and results related to maternal A1C and umbilical cord analytes (insulin, leptin, adiponectin, IGF-I, hematocrit, lipids, C-reactive protein, and interleukin-6)., RESULTS: Intervillous space volume was increased in OT1DM (OT1DM 250 + or - 81 cm(3) vs. control 217 + or - 65 cm(3); P = 0.02) with anisomorphic growth of villi (P = 0.025). The placentas showed a trend to increased weight (OT1DM 690 + or - 19 g; control 641 + or - 22 g; P = 0.08), but villous, nonparenchymal, trophoblast, and capillary volumes did not differ. Villous surface area, capillary surface area, membrane thickness, and calculated morphometric diffusing capacity were also similar in type 1 diabetic and control subjects. A1C at 26-34 weeks associated with birth weight (r = 0.27, P = 0.03), placental weight (r = 0.41, P = 0.0009), and intervillous space volume (r = 0.38, P = 0.0024). In multivariate analysis of cord parameters in OT1DM, fetal IGF-I emerged as a significant correlate of most components (intervillous space, villous, trophoblast, and capillary volumes, all P < 0.01). By contrast, fetal insulin was only independently associated with capillary surface area (positive, r(2) = 6.7%; P = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: There are minimal placental structural differences between OT1DM and control subjects. Fetal IGF-I but not fetal insulin emerges as a key correlate of placental substructural volumes, thereby facilitating feedback to the placenta regarding fetal metabolic demand.

AB  - AIM: Maternal diabetes is associated with polycythaemia and thrombocytopaenia in the offspring; however, the relationship with fetal hormones is unknown. We assessed the association of maternal glycaemic control, birthweight and fetal hormones with haematological indices in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes., METHODS: Prospective study using cord blood samples from 89 offspring of mothers with Type 1 diabetes (OT1DM) and 34 control offspring. Full blood count, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, cortisol, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and C-reactive protein were measured in the umbilical vein at birth., RESULTS: Haematocrit was higher in OT1DM (OT1DM 0.55 +/- 0.17%, control offspring 0.51 +/- 0.06%; P = 0.02). The difference in platelets count was not statistically significant [OT1DM 214 x 10(9)/l (173-259); control offspring 253 x 10(9)/l (180-310), P = 0.06]. Maternal glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) showed a moderate positive correlation with fetal haematocrit (r = 0.30, P = 0.02). Cord platelet counts were negatively associated with birthweight in OT1DM (r = -0.27, P = 0.01). In multivariate models, cord insulin was not associated with haematocrit, but cord leptin was negatively associated with platelets in control offspring (P < 0.001) and OT1DM (P = 0.046), with additional contributions from male sex (P = 0.08) in OT1DM, and IGF-1 (P = 0.04) and insulin (P = 0.04) in control offspring., CONCLUSIONS: Fetal haematocrit is increased in response to diabetes in pregnancy and is related to maternal glycaemic control. Fetal hyperinsulinism, hyperleptinaemia or macrosomia, although readily demonstrable in this cohort, do not emerge as determinants of raised fetal haematocrit in OT1DM. Both increased birthweight and fetal leptin are negatively associated with platelet count.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the association of fetal hormones with placental growth and fetal weight-to-placental weight ratio index (FPI) in pregnancies complicated by maternal diabetes., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective study using umbilical venous blood samples taken at birth from 122 offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes (OT1D) and 46 control subjects., RESULTS: Placental weight (P = 0.009) and gestation-adjusted birth weight (P < 0.001) were increased in OT1D, but FPI was unaltered (P = 0.33). Placental weight correlated with birth weight (P < 0.001) and cord leptin (P < 0.001) in control subjects and OT1D, with further relationships with cord insulin, IGF-1, IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), and triceps and subscapular thickness in OT1D. FPI was associated with adiponectin in both groups, even after adjustment for confounders., CONCLUSIONS: Placental and fetal growth show a parallel increase in mothers with type 1 diabetes. The possible role of adiponectin in matching of fetal and placental growth merits further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes (OT1DM) demonstrate increased fat deposition, hyperinsulinemia, and hyperleptinemia in utero. We examined the influence of maternal diabetes on cord lipids at birth and relationship to body composition, cord insulin, leptin, and other hormonal measures., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We performed an observational study measuring fetal, HDL, and LDL cholesterol; triglycerides; and nonesterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in a total of 139 OT1DM and 48 control subjects at birth and assessed cross-sectional relationships with birth weight, fetal insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and IGF-1., RESULTS: Concentrations of total cholesterol (male OT1DM [mean +/- SD] 1.49 +/- 0.45 mmol/l and male control subjects 1.74 +/- 0.33 mmol/l; P < 0.001), HDL cholesterol (0.53 +/- 0.21 and 0.74 +/- 0.19 mmol/l, respectively; P < 0.001), and NEFA (median 0.17 [interquartile range 2.30-2.95] and 0.21 [0.18-0.36], respectively; P < 0.001) were significantly lower in male OT1DM, with no significant differences in female subjects. Differences in male subjects were independent of mode of delivery. Cord lipids were unrelated to birth weight in OT1DM and did not show consistent relationships with fetal insulin. Unexpectedly, IGF-1 was a strong correlate of HDL cholesterol in control subjects (r = 0.40, P = 0.002) and OT1DM (r = 0.32, P < 0.001) but a negative correlate of triglycerides in control subjects (r = -0.48, P < 0.001) and OT1DM (r = -0.21, P = 0.004), with these relationships present in both sexes. In OT1DM, leptin was also independently correlated (negatively, P < 0.001) with HDL cholesterol in male and female subjects., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes is associated with significant alterations in lipid levels in male fetuses. IGF-1, leptin, and male sex rather than insulin may be the major determinants of HDL cholesterol and triglycerides in utero.

AB  - Introduction: Chemerin as a new adipokine has recently been studied for its crucial role in adipocyte differentiation and insulin signaling. In this study, chemerin levels were determined in the serum of pregnant women of the same gestational age with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and compared with those of healthy pregnant women for their impact on the metabolic process and incidence of gestational diabetics. Material(s) and Method(s): After obtaining a written consent of each individual, totally 200 serum samples were collected from the healthy and gestationally diabetic pregnant women groups. In addition to chemerin, other effective biochemical and metabolic factors of carbohydrate and lipid were determined. Leptin content of cord blood was measured in 100 infants from healthy (50) and gestational diabetes (50) groups. Result(s): Mean serum chemerin levels of pregnant women with gestational diabetes (152.4+/-46.5 mug/dl) were significantly higher (p<0.001) in comparision with those of non-diabetic pregnant women (128.7+/-43.7 mug/dl). Serum chemerin levels were significantly associated with metabolic syndromerelated parameters, including body mass index (BMI) (P<0.05), Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (P<0.001), fasting insulin (P<0.001) and fasting blood (p<0.01) was conducted. Serum chemerin was not significantly correlated with cord blood leptin. Conclusion(s): Serum chemerin levels were higher in pregnant women with gestational diabetes than their nondiabetic pregnant counterparts. Serum chemerin was also independently associated with markers of insulin resistance, and body mass index. Leptin, biochemical and metabolic parameters of mother's infants were not correlated between the two groups.

AB  - Visfatin, a colony-enhancing factor (pre-B-cell), is an inflammatory biomarker that is secreted from a different number of cells and appears to have some proinflammatory or immune-regulating effects. The aim of this study was to compare maternal saliva visfatin levels in women with preterm and term delivery. In This case-control study, women in labor before 37 weeks of gestation were the case group (n = 40) and women in labor after 37 weeks of gestation were in control group (n = 40). The saliva of the participants was sampled and maternal saliva visfatin level was measured by ELISA test. In this study, 80 pregnant women were studied in case and control groups. The mean age of case and control group was 29.1 & PLUSMN;6.9 and 30.55 & PLUSMN;5.3 years, respectively. The results revealed that the mean maternal saliva visfatin level in the preterm group (4.75 & PLUSMN;2.2) is significantly (p = 0.001) lower than that in term birth group (6.7 & PLUSMN;3.1). The results of adjusted logistic regression revealed that after adjusting for GDM, preeclampsia, pre pregnancy BMI and weight gain, the mean of maternal saliva visfatin level in the preterm group is significantly lower than that in the term group (p = 0.026). Considering that during the term pregnancy visfatin levels increase and visfatin may play a role in initiating labor, in our study due to the high visfatin level in case group although the level of maternal saliva visfatin was lower than the control group but high levels of visfatin in the case group can represent the role of visfatin in initiating labor and due to this issue can be use the role of this adipokine for early diagnosis of preterm delivery can be used to prevent, treat and improve the prognosis of this disease. Also, this study is the first study to compare the maternal saliva visfatin level between SGA and AGA group and there is no difference between these groups.

AB  - Maternal obesity and nutrient excess in utero increase the risk of future metabolic diseases. The mechanisms underlying this process are poorly understood, but probably include genetic, epigenetic alterations and changes in fetal nutrient supply. We have studied the microRNA (miRNA) expression profile in amnion from obese and control women at delivery to investigate if a specific miRNA signature is associated with obesity. The expression profile of 365 human miRNAs was evaluated with the TaqMan Array in amnion from 10 obese and 5 control (prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) >30 and <25 kg m(-2), respectively) women at delivery. Target genes and miRNA-regulated pathways were predicted by bioinformatics. Anthropometric and biochemical parameters were also measured in mothers and newborns. Seven miRNAs were expressed only in obese women (miR-422b, miR-219, miR-575, miR-523, miR-579, miR-618 and miR-659), whereas 13 miRNAs were expressed at a higher level and 12 miRNAs at a lower level in obese women than in controls. MicroRNAs significantly downregulated the neurotrophin, cancer/ErbB, mammalian target of rapamycin, insulin, adipocytokine, actin cytoskeleton and mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathways. In conclusion, we show that the miRNA profile is altered in amnion during obesity and hypothesize that this could affect pathways important for placental growth and function, thereby contributing to an increase in the newborn's risk of future metabolic diseases.

AB  - Low birth weight and length for gestational age are associated with a high risk of short stature and metabolic syndrome in adulthood. The mechanisms that link prenatal growth to adult stature and metabolic syndrome have not yet been entirely clarified. The aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between standardized anthropometric measures at birth and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I, IGF-II, insulin, adiponectin, and non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) cord blood levels in the general population. One hundred fifty-eight random newborn subjects (77F, 81M) from Genoa, Italy, were analyzed. Anthropometric parameters were measured and standardized according to standard Italian tables. Insulin values were treated as categorical, since in several cases the results fell below detection cut-off. Mean birth weight was 3,214.23-/+488.99 gr and mean length was 49.82-/+2.17 cm. Females had higher mean IGF-I (p=0.04), and were more likely to have insulin values either <2 uU/ml or >4.5uU/ml (p= 0.04) compared to males. Weight and length SD scores (SDS) were higher in subjects with elevated insulin levels (p=0.002). A moderate correlation was found between weight and IGF-II (r=0.354). Multivariable analysis demonstrated that standardized birth weight was associated with IGFII and insulin values. Our data highlight the importance of IGF-II in fetal growth and suggest that gender differences should be taken into consideration when evaluating prenatal growth.

Serum resistin, pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A), and uterine artery pulsatility index (PI) at 11 to 13 weeks were measured in 480 singleton pregnancies, including 240 with normal outcome, 60 that subsequently developed preeclampsia (PE), 60 that developed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), 60 that delivered large for gestational age (LGA) neonates, and 60 that delivered small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. Each value in both the normal and pathological outcome groups was expressed as a multiple of the expected normal median (MoM), and the median MoM values in the outcome groups were compared. In the PE group, compared with the controls, there were an increase in median resistin (1.22 MoM, P = .003) and uterine artery PI (1.25 MoM, P < .0001) and a decrease in serum PAPP-A (0.72, P < .0001). There was no significant association between serum resistin with either uterine artery PI (P = .415) or serum PAPP-A (P = .290). In the SGA, LGA, and GDM groups, serum resistin MoM was not significantly different from that of the controls (P = .415, P = .702, and P = .549, respectively). In pregnancies that develop PE, maternal serum resistin concentration at 11 to 13 weeks is increased in a manner not related to altered placental perfusion or function. In pregnancies complicated by the development of GDM or delivery of SGA or LGA neonates, serum resistin is not significantly altered. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether maternal serum levels of adiponectin in the first trimester are altered in pregnancies that subsequently deliver small for gestational age (SGA) neonates., METHODS: Maternal serum adiponectin and pregnancy-associated plasma protein A (PAPP-A) were measured at 11-13 weeks' gestation in 50 singleton normotensive pregnancies that delivered SGA neonates and 300 non-SGA controls. The median adiponectin and PAPP-A levels in the SGA and non-SGA groups, expressed as multiple of the unaffected median (MoM), were compared., RESULTS: The distribution of serum adiponectin was made gaussian by square root (sqrt) transformation. Regression analysis in the non-SGA group demonstrated that for sqrt adiponectin a significant independent contribution was provided by maternal age, weight, smoking status, African and South-Asian racial origin. Each value in the SGA and non-SGA group was then converted into a multiple of the non-SGA median (MoM) after adjustment for maternal characteristics. In the SGA group, compared to the non-SGA controls, median maternal serum PAPP-A was decreased (0.79, interquartile range [IQR] 0.54-1.06 MoM vs. 1.00, IQR 0.71-1.39 MoM) but adiponectin MoM was not significantly different (0.89, IQR 0.65-1.31 MoM vs. 1.02, IQR 0.70-1.29 MoM)., CONCLUSION: Maternal serum adiponectin is not a useful biochemical marker for early prediction of SGA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential role of maternal serum level of adiponectin in the first trimester of pregnancy in the prediction of neonatal macrosomia., METHODS: Maternal serum adiponectin concentration was measured in a case-control study of singleton pregnancies at 11 to 13 weeks' gestation, which included 50 cases that subsequently delivered macrosomic neonates with birth weight above the 95th percentile for gestation at delivery and 300 controls who delivered appropriate for gestational age neonates. The median multiple of the median (MoM) serum adiponectin in the two outcome groups was compared and the bivariate Gaussian distributions were simulated in a screened population of 33 344 pregnancies to estimate the performance of screening for macrosomia by a combination of maternal characteristics and obstetric history with serum adiponectin., RESULTS: In the macrosomic group the median serum adiponectin [0.82, interquartile range (IQR): 0.56-1.02 MoM] was significantly lower than in the non-macrosomic controls (1.02, IQR: 0.70-1.29 MoM; p = 0.001). The estimated detection rate of macrosomia, at fixed false positive rate of 10%, from maternal characteristics and obstetric history was 34.6% and this increased to 38.2% with the addition of serum adiponectin., CONCLUSION: Maternal serum adiponectin at 11 to 13 weeks is a useful biomarker for early prediction of macrosomia.

AB  - Children born small for gestational age (SGA) have several life-long consequences. Previous epidemiological studies investigated from childhood to adulthood reported that a number of chronic diseases originate in the prenatal period. With the emerging era of obesity epidemic, more concerns are related to being obese than being short-statured in SGA children. The exact mechanisms are uncertain; however, growth hormone-insulin-like growth factor axis disturbance by fetal programming and accelerated postnatal weight gain contributed to central adiposity in SGA children. In this review, we summarized the definitions and prevalence of SGA, epidemiology, and general risks of obesity in SGA children. Early interventions, before and after birth, are needed for healthy catch-up growth to prevent later obesity and related complications.Copyright © 2018 Annals of Pediatric Endocrinology & Metabolism.

AB  - Leptin, one of adipocytokines, plays a wide range of important roles in reproductive biology. We have previously reported that low hypo-adiponectinemia might be involved in the pathophysiology of overweight preeclampsia (PE) patients. Moreover, recent reports have underscored the importance of circulating angiogenic factors in the pathophysiology of PE. Here, we examined whether leptin in conjunction with adiponectin and/or angiogenic factors plays some role in the pathophysiology of PE. We performed a cross-sectional study in 34 PE patients and normal pregnancies matched for gestational age and body mass index as controls. We measured serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), placental growth factor, and the soluble VEGF receptors sFlt-1 and sFlk-1. We observed that leptin levels in PE patients were significantly higher compared with those in controls, but did not observe significant differences between normal- and overweight patients in both groups. We also showed a significant negative correlation between leptin and adiponectin in controls, but not in PE patients. There was a significant correlation between leptin and sFlt-1 in PE patients, while there were significant differences of body mass index, mean blood pressure and proteinuria between high and low leptin/sFlt-1 ratio group in PE patients. Moreover, there was a significant difference of leptin level between IUGR and normal growth group in PE patients. These results suggest that the circulating increased leptin might be derived mainly from the placenta and regulated by the placental hypoxic condition, whereas adiponectin might be derived mainly from adipose tissue; and that leptin might play some role through insulin resistance, autonomic activation, or direct effect on endothelium with other angiogenic factors in pathophysiology of PE compared with the exaggerated release of adiponectin from adipose tissue.

AB  - Low birth weight (LBW) infants have higher risk of developing insulin resistance and its comorbidities later in life. The concept of "developmental origins of health and disease" suggests that intrauterine and postnatal environments have an important role in increasing these risks. The risk of such adult-onset diseases in LBW infants might be associated with adipose tissue maldevelopment including altered body composition and increased amount of visceral fat, which is the same mechanism as that in children and adults with metabolic syndrome. However, LBW infants often have different characteristics: they are not always overweight or obese over their life course. The inconsistency might be associated with the thrifty phenotype, which is produced in response to impaired growth potential and decreased lean body mass. LBW infants tend to be obese within the limits of impaired growth potential. Through our previous investigations evaluating longitudinal changes in adiponectin levels at an early stage of life, we speculated that probably, the intrauterine life of term infants or the period up to term-equivalent age in preterm infants might be the key age for the development of adipose tissues including fat cells. Because of that, we hypothesized that the smaller number of adipocytes in LBW infants might be associated with overloading of single adipocytes and impaired adipose tissue expandability. The possible mechanisms are discussed from the perspective of adipose tissue maldevelopment in LBW infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm infants have altered fat tissue development, including a higher percentage of fat mass and increased volume of visceral fat. They also have altered adiponectin levels, including a lower ratio of high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMW-Ad) to total adiponectin (T-Ad) at term-equivalent age, compared with term infants., AIMS: The objective of this study was to investigate the association between adiponectin levels and fat tissue accumulation or distribution in preterm infants at term-equivalent age., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional clinical study., SUBJECTS: Study subjects were 53 preterm infants born at <=34weeks gestation with a mean birth weight of 1592g., OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum levels of T-Ad and HMW-Ad were measured and a computed tomography (CT) scan was performed at the level of the umbilicus at term-equivalent age to analyze how fat tissue accumulation or distribution was correlated with adiponectin levels., RESULTS: T-Ad (r=0.315, p=0.022) and HMW-Ad levels (r=0.338, p=0.013) were positively associated with subcutaneous fat area evaluated by performing CT scan at term-equivalent age, but were not associated with visceral fat area in simple regression analyses. In addition, T-Ad (beta=0.487, p=0.003) and HMW-Ad levels (beta=0.602, p<0.001) were positively associated with subcutaneous fat tissue area, but they were not associated with visceral fat area also in multiple regression analyses., CONCLUSION: Subcutaneous fat accumulation contributes to increased levels of T-Ad and HMW-Ad, while visceral fat accumulation does not influence adiponectin levels in preterm infants at term-equivalent age.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: This study aimed to investigate total adiponectin (T-Ad) and high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMW-Ad) levels in preterm infants at term-equivalent age and to assess the relationship between adiponectin levels and early postnatal growth., METHODS: The study included 43 term infants and 58 preterm infants born at 34 weeks' gestation or less. T-Ad and HMW-Ad levels were measured in the preterm infants at birth and at term-equivalent age, and in the term infants at birth. Adiponectin levels were statistically compared between preterm and term infants to evaluate the association between postnatal growth and changes in the adiponectin levels in preterm infants., RESULTS: The T-Ad levels were higher and the ratio of HMW-Ad to T-Ad (HMW%) was lower in preterm infants at term-equivalent age than in term infants. Further, body weight SD score changes were positively associated with T-Ad and HMW-Ad increases in preterm infants from birth to term-equivalent age. The HMW% changes had a negative association only with HMW% in cord blood., CONCLUSION: Preterm infants have altered adiponectin levels at term-equivalent age. Further, postnatal growth may contribute to adiponectin increases from birth to term-equivalent age, although HMW% changes might be regulated before birth at least up to term-equivalent age in preterm infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The roles of adiponectin and leptin in the early stages of life are poorly understood. We previously studied longitudinal changes in these adipocytokines from birth to 12 months of age. The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the correlation between cord serum adipocytokine levels and postnatal growth by 3 years of age., METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to obtain the general physical measurements of 3-year-olds from 56 healthy newborn infants born at a gestational age of 35 weeks or more; 45 valid responses were obtained. The correlations between variables, including cord serum adipocytokine levels at birth and general physical measurements at 3 years, were investigated., RESULTS: Body mass index (BMI) Z-score gain from birth to 3 years was negatively correlated with birthweight SD scores (beta=-0.395, P= 0.019) and gestational age (beta=-0.557, P= 0.016), and positively correlated with cord serum adiponectin levels (beta= 0.253, P= 0.043). BMI Z-score gain from birth to 6 months was negatively correlated with only birthweight SD score (beta=-0.442, P= 0.017). Cord serum leptin levels were not a significant predictor of BMI Z-scores gain in our subjects. BMI Z-scores at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 years of age were not related to cord serum adiponectin or leptin levels., CONCLUSIONS: Birthweight SD score, gestational age, and cord serum adiponectin levels are significant predictors of BMI Z-score gain from birth to 3 years of age in Japanese infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum leptin and adiponectin levels are strongly associated with lipid metabolism in adults. These adipocytokines play a role in intrauterine and postnatal growth but the association between cord blood levels of these adipocytokines and cholesterol at birth remains unclear., METHODS: The study involved 52 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants (25 male, 27 female, 37-41 weeks of gestational age) born at Keiai Hospital without any maternal complications. Cord blood concentrations of leptin, total adiponectin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), other neonatal characteristics, and maternal factors were assessed to investigate the association between cord blood leptin or adiponectin levels and cholesterol levels., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin levels were significantly higher in girls. Simple regression analysis indicated that cord blood leptin levels were significantly associated with birthweight, gestational age, birthweight SD score, body mass index (BMI), ponderal index, LDL-C, and TC; but total adiponectin levels were not significantly associated with any neonatal characteristics or maternal factors. A multiple regression analysis indicated that cord leptin levels were significantly associated with BMI (beta= 0.407, P= 0.001), LDL-C (beta=-0.345, P= 0.004), and infant's gender (beta=-0.332, P= 0.006); adiponectin levels were significantly associated with only gestational age (beta= 0.279, P= 0.047)., CONCLUSION: Cord leptin level is significantly associated with cord cholesterol level at birth, anthropometry, and infant gender. The present study suggests that cord blood leptin may be a key hormone for controlling fetal lipid metabolism.

AB  - Adiponectin has anti-atherosclerotic effects through its direct actions on vascular cells. The present study investigates the molecular mechanisms of adiponectin in the migration of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) which play an important role in neovascularization and re-endothelization. The phosphorylation of Akt and the activations of Cdc42 and Rac1 were significantly increased by adiponectin. Adiponectin increased the migration activity of EPCs, which was completely inhibited by a PI3-kinase inhibitor. siRNA of Cdc42 or Rac1 completely inhibited the adiponectin-induced migration, but siRNA of Akt had no effects, indicating that adiponectin promotes the migration activities of EPCs mainly through PI3-kinase/Cdc42/Rac1.

AB  - Large birthweight, or macrosomia, is one of the commonest complications for pregnancies affected by diabetes. As macrosomia is associated with an increased risk of a number of adverse outcomes for both the mother and offspring, accurate antenatal prediction of fetal macrosomia could be beneficial in guiding appropriate models of care and interventions that may avoid or reduce these associated risks. However, current prediction strategies which include physical examination and ultrasound assessment, are imprecise. Biomarkers are proving useful in various specialties and may offer a new avenue for improved prediction of macrosomia. Prime biomarker candidates in pregnancies with diabetes include maternal glycaemic markers (glucose, 1,5-anhydroglucitol, glycosylated hemoglobin) and hormones proposed implicated in placental nutrient transfer (adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor-1). There is some support for an association of these biomarkers with birthweight and/or macrosomia, although current evidence in this emerging field is still limited. Thus, although biomarkers hold promise, further investigation is needed to elucidate the potential clinical utility of biomarkers for macrosomia prediction for pregnancies affected by diabetes.

AB  - CONTEXT: Zinc-alpha2-Glycoprotein (ZAG) is an adipokine with lipolytic action and is positively associated with adiponectin in adipose tissue. We hypothesize that ZAG may be related with hydrocarbonate metabolism disturbances observed in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze serum ZAG concentration and its relationship with carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women and its influence on fetal growth., DESIGN: 207 pregnant women (130 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) and 77 with GDM) recruited in the early third trimester and their offspring were studied. Cord blood was obtained at delivery and neonatal anthropometry was assessed in the first 48 hours. ZAG was determined in maternal serum and cord blood., RESULTS: ZAG concentration was lower in cord blood than in maternal serum, but similar concentration was observed in NGT and GDM pregnant women. Also similar levels were found between offspring of NGT and GDM women. In the bivariate analysis, maternal ZAG (mZAG) was positively correlated with adiponectin and HDL cholesterol, and negatively correlated with insulin and triglyceride concentrations, and HOMA index. On the other hand, cord blood ZAG (cbZAG) was positively correlated with fat-free mass, birth weight and gestational age at delivery. After adjusting for confounding variables, gestational age at delivery and HDL cholesterol emerged as the sole determinants of cord blood ZAG and maternal ZAG concentrations, respectively., CONCLUSION: mZAG was not associated with glucose metabolism during pregnancy. ZAG concentration was lower in cord blood compared with maternal serum. cbZAG was independently correlated with gestational age at delivery, suggesting a role during the accelerated fetal growth during latter pregnancy.

AB  - AIM: The local expression of two isoenzymes of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, type 1 (11betaHSD-1) and type 2 (11betaHSD-2), regulates the access of glucocorticoid hormones to their target cells. Reports on the association between the placental expression of 11betaHSD and infantile growth are limited. The aim of the present study was to investigate if the placental gene expression of 11betaHSD affects infantile growth at 10 months of age., METHODS: Placentas and umbilical venous cord blood were obtained from 42 singleton cases of cesarean deliveries between 31 and 40 weeks of gestation at Hamamatsu University Hospital between March 2009 and June 2010. The gene expression of both 11betaHSD-1 and 11betaHSD-2 was measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. Adiponectin and leptin levels in umbilical cord blood were measured using enzyme-linked immunoassay., RESULTS: 11betaHSD-1 and 11betaHSD-2 gene expression in human placentas did not correlate with bodyweight or the ponderal index (PI) at 10 months of age, whereas the gene expression of 11betaHSD-1, but not 11betaHSD-2, correlated with birthweight as well as PI at birth. Adiponectin levels in umbilical cord blood significantly correlated with the placental gene expression of 11betaHSD-1 as well as bodyweight and PI at 10 months of age, although no direct correlation was observed between them., CONCLUSION: No direct correlation was observed between the placental gene expression of 11betaHSD and infantile growth at 10 months of age. However, the placental gene expression of 11betaHSD-1 may be indirectly connected with infantile growth via adiponectin-associated metabolic regulation represented by adiponectin levels in umbilical cord blood.

AB  - Objectives: Epidemiological and animal studies have shown that maternal obesity predisposes the offspring to obesity and the metabolic syndrome, possibly via late-onset metabolic programming of the fetus. Little is known, however, about the metabolic effect of maternal obesity on the fetus. This study investigated the effect of a maternal high-fat diet (HFD) on fetal growth and glucose metabolism using a diet-induced obesity mouse model. Study design: Female mice (6 weeks old; C57BL/6N) were fed either a normal chow diet (NCD, 10 kcal% fat) or an HFD (60 kcal% fat) for 4 weeks before mating and throughout pregnancy. At 17 days of gestation, gene expression of inflammatory markers and adipokines in fetal subcutaneous adipose tissue was analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: HFD mice were overweight, glucose intolerant and insulin resistant compared with NCD mice of the same gestational age. Although fetal body weight was not significantly different, fetal plasma glucose and insulin levels were higher in the HFD group than the NCD group. Furthermore, examination of fetal subcutaneous adipose tissue in the HFD group revealed hypertrophy with an increase in the levels of cluster of differentiation-68, chemokine receptor-2 and tumor necrosis factor-os mRNA, but a decrease in the level of glucose transporter-4 mRNA. Conclusion: Maternal HFD causes inflammatory changes in the adipose tissue of offspring. (c) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have demonstrated that low birth weight is associated with an increased incidence of visceral obesity and metabolic disorders in later life. In the present study, we have determined the impact of birth weight and gender on gene expression in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) in the young adult sheep. Lambs (n = 19, birth weight range 2.6-7.55 kg) were born at term and growth monitored for 22.4 +/- 0.2 weeks, when body composition was determined by Dual X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) and samples of VAT and subcutaneous (SCAT) adipose tissue collected. Plasma samples were collected at post-mortem for the determination of free fatty acids (FFA), glucose and insulin concentrations. Peroxisome-Proliferator Activated Receptor-gamma (PPAR-gamma), glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), lipoprotein lipase (LPL), adiponectin and leptin mRNA expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Fractional growth rate in postnatal weeks 1-3 was inversely related to birth weight in both males and females,(R-2 = 0.22, P < 0.05, n = 19). PPAR-gamma mRNA expression in VAT, but not SCAT, was inversely related to birth weight (R-2 = 0.60, P < 0.01, n = 18). In males, but not females, PPAR-gamma mRNA in VAT was directly related to G3PDH mRNA expression (R-2 = 0.69, P < 0.01, n = 9). Plasma FFA concentrations were inversely related to birth weight in both males and females (R-2 = 0.22, P < 0.05, n = 19). These findings demonstrate that low birth weight is associated with an increased expression of a key adipogenic factor in visceral adipose tissue in young adulthood. In males, this is associated with an increased expression of lipogenic genes, and this may contribute to the increased propensity for visceral obesity in low birth weight males compared to females.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early postnatal antibiotic use has been shown to promote excess weight gain, but it is unclear whether intrauterine exposure to antibiotics is associated with foetal growth and adiposity. The objective of this study was to examine associations of antibiotic prescription in each trimester of pregnancy with foetal size and adipokine levels at birth., METHODS: In 2128 pregnant women from the pre-birth Project Viva cohort, from electronic medical records, we estimated antibiotic prescribing by timing during pregnancy. Outcomes were sex-specific birth weight-for-gestational-age z-score (BW/GA-z) and levels of umbilical cord leptin and adiponectin. We used linear regression models adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, race/ethnicity, education, smoking during pregnancy, household income and child sex and additionally adjusted cord blood leptin and adiponectin models for gestation length., RESULTS: Of the 2128 women in our sample, 643 (30.2%) were prescribed with oral antibiotics during pregnancy. Mean (standard deviation) BW/GA-z was 0.17 (0.97), cord blood leptin was 9.0 ng mL-1 (6.6) and cord blood adiponectin was 28.8 ng mL-1 (6.8). Overall, antibiotic prescription in pregnancy was associated with lower BW/GA-z [multivariable adjusted beta -0.11; 95% confidence interval {CI} -0.20, -0.01]. In trimester-specific analyses, only second trimester antibiotic prescription was associated with lower BW/GA-z (beta -0.23; 95% CI -0.37, -0.08). Overall, antibiotic prescription in pregnancy was not associated with cord blood leptin or adiponectin levels. However, in trimester-specific analyses, third trimester antibiotic prescription was associated with higher cord blood leptin (beta 2.28 ng mL-1 ; 95% CI 0.38, 4.17)., CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics in mid-pregnancy were associated with lower birth weight for gestational age, whereas third trimester antibiotics were associated with higher cord blood leptin.

AB  - Rates of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are on the rise worldwide, and the number of pregnancies impacted by GDM and resulting complications are also increasing. Pregnancy is a period of unique metabolic plasticity, during which mild insulin resistance is a physiological adaptation to prioritize fetal growth. To compensate for this, the pancreatic beta-cell utilizes a variety of adaptive mechanisms, including increasing mass, number and insulin-secretory capacity to maintain glucose homeostasis. When insufficient insulin production does not overcome insulin resistance, hyperglycemia can occur. Changes in the maternal system that occur in GDM such as lipotoxicity, inflammation and oxidative stress, as well as impairments in adipokine and placental signalling, are associated with impaired beta-cell adaptation. Understanding these pathways, as well as mechanisms of beta-cell dysfunction in pregnancy, can identify novel therapeutic targets beyond diet and lifestyle interventions, insulin and antihyperglycemic agents currently used for treating GDM.

AB  - Leptin is a hormone synthesized by adipocytes and other tissues, including the placenta, and it regulates food intake and energy expenditure, reproductive and immune functions. To investigate the role of leptin in neonatal immunity, we measured serum leptin and cytokine (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12) levels in the cord blood (cb) of 510 healthy neonates, 14 small for gestational age (SGA), 312 appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) and 184 large for gestational age (LGA). Median serum leptin concentration in the whole sample was 11 ng/ml. In 11.2% neonates (1 SGA, 32 AGA, 24 LGA), leptin levels were >90th percentile (median 39 ng/ml). In 33.3% of those (3.72% of total sample) with the highest leptin levels (median 46 ng/ml), significantly elevated levels of serum IFN-gamma were also found (mean 27.11 pg/ml, range 17.5-38.5 pg/ml). In neonates with leptin levels ~50th percentile (median 12 ng/ml) or <10th percentile (median 1 ng/ml), serum IFN-gamma levels were negligible. All other cytokines measured, were < the assays' detection limits. To investigate whether leptin can independently influence cytokine gene expression by cb T-cells and monocytes (Mc), we cultured cb T-cells or Mc, isolated from randomly selected AGA neonates or adult peripheral blood, with leptin. This resulted in upregulation of IL-2, IFN-gamma and IL-4 gene expression in cb and adult T-cells and IL-10 expression mainly in cb-Mc. Significantly higher expression of IFN-gamma occurred in female cb-T-cells cultured with leptin, compared with male cb-T-cells. In conclusion, the concurrent presence of high concentrations in both leptin and IFN-gamma in cb of healthy infants, and leptin's ability to directly upregulate cytokine gene expression in cb T and Mc cells, indicate that abnormally high leptin levels can independently influence the immune system of healthy newborns, and may mediate gender differences in the development of a Th1 polarized immune response.

AB  - Scope: Maternal vitamin D deficiency has been implicated in adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the association between vitamin D and inflammation, particularly adipokines, remains unexplored in pregnancy. Methods and results: In 102 overweight or obese pregnant women at high-risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), we investigated relationships between maternal 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations at 12-15 wk gestation (baseline) and serum lipids, inflammatory markers, novel adipokines (omentin-1, visfatin, high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin), and subsequent pregnancy outcomes (GDM, preeclampsia, preterm birth [PTB]). After adjustment for maternal factors (age, BMI, parity, ethnicity, and smoking status), baseline 25(OH)D concentrations were inversely associated with total cholesterol and triglycerides, and positively associated with HMW-adiponectin. Higher baseline 25(OH)D concentrations were associated with decreased fasting and 1-h post-OGTT glucose and reduced risk of GDM at 26-28 wk, as well as with longer gestation and reduced risk of PTB upon additional adjustment for caesarean section. Adding HMW-adiponectin to the multivariable models attenuated most associations, and HMW-adiponectin was a significant predictor in the models. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that lower maternal 25(OH)D concentrations in overweight/obese pregnant women at high-risk of GDM are associated with increased cardiometabolic risks during pregnancy and adverse pregnancy outcomes, and that these associations may be mediated by HMW-adiponectin.

AB  - Perinatal nutrition is a key player in the susceptibility to developing metabolic diseases in adulthood, leading to the concept of "metabolic programming". The aim of this study was to assess the impact of maternal protein restriction during gestation and lactation on glucose homeostasis and eating behaviour in female offspring. Pregnant rats were fed a normal or protein-restricted (PR) diet and followed throughout gestation and lactation. Body weight, glucose homeostasis, and eating behaviour were evaluated in offspring, especially in females. Body weight gain was lower in PR dams during lactation only, despite different food and water intakes throughout gestation and lactation. Plasma concentration of leptin, adiponectin and triglycerides increased drastically before delivery in PR dams in relation to fat deposits. Although all pups had identical birth body weight, PR offspring body weight differed from control offspring around postnatal day 10 and remained lower until adulthood. Offspring glucose homeostasis was mildly impacted by maternal PR, although insulin secretion was reduced for PR rats at adulthood. Food intake, satiety response, and cerebral activation were examined after a lipid preload and demonstrated some differences between the two groups of rats. Maternal PR during gestation and lactation does induce extrauterine growth restriction, accompanied by alterations in maternal plasma leptin and adiponectin levels, which may be involved in programming the alterations in eating behaviour observed in females at adulthood.

AB  - Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is one of the common endocrine diseases that affects women in their reproductive age. PCOS has diverse clinical implications that include reproductive (infertility, hyperandrogenism, hirsutism), metabolic (insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases) and psychological features (increased anxiety, depression and worsened quality of life). The exact patho-physiology of PCOS is complex and remains largely unclear. The prevalence of PCOS is estimated at 4-18%, depending on diverse factors discussed ahead. The phenotype varies widely depending on life stage, genotype, ethnicity and environmental factors including lifestyle and body weight. During the last decades, obesity and excess weight are major chronic diseases all around the word. Obesity increases some features of PCOS such as hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, infertility and pregnancy complications. Both obesity and insulin resistance increase diabetes mellitus type 2 and cardiovascular diseases. Moreover, obesity impairs insulin resistance and exacerbates reproductive and metabolic features of PCOS. It is well known that obesity is associated with anovulation, pregnancy loss and late pregnancy complications (pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes). Obesity in PCOS is also linked to failure or delayed response to the various treatments including clomiphene citrate, gonadotropins and laparoscopic ovarian diathermy. It has been reported that, after losing as little as 5 % of initial body weight obese women with PCOS improved spontaneous ovulation rates and spontaneous pregnancy. Therefore, the weight loss prior to conception improves live birth rate in obese women with or without PCOS. The treatment of obesity may include lifestyle therapy (diet and exercise), pharmacological treatment and bariatric surgery. In summary, weight loss is considered the first-line therapy in obese women with PCOS. In the present review, the consequence and treatment of obesity in women with PCOS are discussed.

AB  - Visfatin is a novel-secreted 52 kDa adipokine that appears to mimic the action of insulin, inducing glucose transport into mammalian cells. We examined visfatin expression in a cohort of pregnant women to determine if pregnancy influenced visfatin gene expression, circulating levels of visfatin, or local concentrations of visfatin in either omental fat or placenta. Samples of female omental fat, blood and placenta were collected over a 2-year period and frozen at -80 degrees C until they were employed in a series of various assays. Samples were collected during delivery in pregnant women, at hysterectomy in lean women and at bariatric surgery in obese and obese diabetic women. Visfatin expression and concentrations were measured in four cohorts of women: lean controls, pregnant women at term, obese (BMI > 40) and obese diabetic women (BMI > 40). Visfatin expression was seven times higher in omental fat of pregnant women than in lean women. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) demonstrated that the visfatin gene transcript was translated to protein. An immunoblot confirmed that visfatin protein was much higher in pregnant women than in obese women. Serum visfatin was 20.8 ng/ml (n = 7) in lean women as compared to 40.3 ng/ml in pregnant women (n = 4); thus the increased visfatin mRNA levels in omental fat were not reflected in increased serum visfatin. We measured visfatin mRNA content of human placenta and found that placenta expresses substantial amounts of visfatin. GAP-DH, a housekeeping gene that is highly expressed in most human cells had a threshold value (Gt) of 20.9 versus a Ct of 22.4 for visfatin. Again, IHC confirmed that placental visfatin mRNA was translated into visfatin protein. [H-3] 2-deoxyglucose transport was measured in partially differentiated 3T3-L1 preadipocytes. At a concentration of 2 nM, visfatin and insulin produced nearly identical increases in glucose transport. Taken together, these data suggest there is a selective increase in visfatin gene expression in pregnant women at term. Since visfatin also potently and efficaciously induced glucose transport in a cell culture model, any hypothetical role for visfatin in pregnancy should include the possibility that it may function in regulation of maternl/fetal glucose metabolism or distribution.

AB  - The authors realise a synthesis on classical data and recent pathogenic explanations in childhood obesity. The obesity is a nutritional disorder of great interest nowadays and surpasses the incidence of the major problem of pediatrics until now--the malnutrition. There is documented data concerning the global incidence of obesity which is continuously growing when it comes to children. That is why the prophylaxis must become a priority by using measures in the first period of life (natural feeding, the need of late diversification, the avoidance of hyperproteic diets). The recent pathogenic data and the long term populational studies change the old conceptions regarding the risk of some categories of children. Thus mother's malnutrition, the low birth weight, children that followed hyperproteic diets paradoxically represent categories of risk for obesity. A recent recorded phenomenon, which amplifies the risk for obesity is the early adiposity rebound which is recorded nowadays even for ages lower than five years. There are described the hormonal mechanisms involved in appetite and satiety up to the receptor level: leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, endocannabinoid receptors. There are pointed out all the long term risk elements (high birth weight, low birth weight, the pregnant woman's nutrition) and the modern medical treatments for obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal overweight and obesity during pregnancy is associated with insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, hyperlipidaemia and a low-grade state of chronic inflammation. The aim of this pre-specified analysis of secondary outcome measures was to evaluate the effect of providing antenatal dietary and lifestyle advice on cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarkers., METHODS: We conducted a multicentre trial in which pregnant women who were overweight or obese were randomised to receive either Lifestyle Advice or Standard Care. We report a range of pre-specified secondary maternal and newborn cardiometabolic and inflammatory biomarker outcomes. Maternal whole venous blood was collected at trial entry (mean 14 weeks gestation; non-fasting), at 28 weeks gestation (fasting), and at 36 weeks gestation (non-fasting). Cord blood was collected after birth and prior to the delivery of the placenta. A range of cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers were analysed (total cholesterol, triglycerides, non-esterified fatty acids, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, glucose, leptin, adiponectin, C-reactive protein, granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor, interferon gamma, TNF-alpha, and interleukins 1beta, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, and 10). Participants were analysed in the groups to which they were randomised, and were included in the analyses if they had a measure at any time point., RESULTS: One or more biological specimens were available from 1951 women (989 Lifestyle Advice and 962 Standard Care), with cord blood from 1174 infants (596 Lifestyle Advice and 578 Standard Care). There were no statistically significant differences in mean cardiometabolic and inflammatory marker concentrations across pregnancy and in infant cord blood between treatment groups. Estimated treatment group differences were close to zero, with 95% confidence intervals spanning a range of differences that were short of clinical relevance. There was no evidence to suggest that the intervention effect was modified by maternal BMI category., CONCLUSIONS: Despite our findings, it will be worth considering potential relationships between cardiometabolic and inflammatory markers and clinical outcomes, including longer-term infant health and adiposity., TRIAL REGISTRATION: Australian and New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ( ACTRN12607000161426 ; Date Registered 09/03/2007).

AB  - Some new insights on the metabolic syndrome are reviewed. The reasons why epidemic metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease are increasingly affecting poor economies are discussed in the first part of this article. Hypothesis on the specific relation between in-utero insulin resistance and in-utero undernutrition due to mother-fetal undernutrition and/ or placental dysfunction are reviewed. Both prenatal conditions, which are medical and economic problems, are often encountered in pauperized populations and turn into elevated rates of low birth weight. In the second part of this revision, new epidemiological evidence on the value of metabolic syndrome as a tool for diagnosis and prognosis is presented. Special emphasis has been placed on the MPhil publication, based on Norfolk's epidemiological study. In this publication the authors have demonstrated, using a prospective design in 2 000 subjects who were followed for 9.1 years, that waist/hip ratio is the best clinical marker of body adiposity in order to predict cardiovascular events. This finding is of great clinical value. Finally, in the third part of this update, key data from basic research on pro-inflammatory mechanisms in abdominal obesity (dysfunctional adipocyte-monocyte intercommunication) are summarized. Also, new information focused on adiponectin is presented. The mechanisms intrinsic to adiponectin, which make this molecule protective for heart and brain, are discussed in this last section.

AB  - Maternal obesity programs the offspring to metabolic diseases later in life; however, the mechanisms of programming are yet unclear, and no strategies exist for addressing its detrimental transgenerational effects. Obesity has been linked to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), an adipokine, and treatment of obese individuals with DPPIV inhibitors has been reported to prevent weight gain and improve metabolism. We hypothesized that DPPIV plays a role in maternal obesity-mediated programming. We measured plasma DPPIV activity in human maternal and cord blood samples from normal-weight and obese mothers at term. We found that maternal obesity increases maternal and cord blood plasma DPPIV activity but only in male offspring. Using two non-human primate models of maternal obesity, we confirmed the activation of DPPIV in the offspring of obese mothers. We then created a mouse model of maternal high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity, and found an early-life increase in plasma DPPIV activity in male offspring. Activation of DPPIV preceded the progression of obesity, glucose intolerance and insulin resistance in male offspring of HFD-fed mothers. We then administered sitagliptin, DPPIV inhibitor, to regular diet (RD)- and HFD-fed mothers, starting a week prior to breeding and continuing throughout pregnancy and lactation. We found that sitagliptin treatment of HFD-fed mothers delayed the progression of obesity and metabolic diseases in male offspring and had no effects on females. Our findings reveal that maternal obesity dysregulates plasma DPPIV activity in males and provide evidence that maternal inhibition of DPPIV has potential for addressing the transgenerational effects of maternal obesity.

AB  - Objective: To determine if an elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index is associated with abnormal respiratory function and atopy in children aged 12 years. Methods: This prospective case-control study compared children that had an elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index (>90th centile) to those with a normal pulsatility index (<90th centile). All subjects were delivered at full-term and with appropriate growth for gestational age. Outcome measures included; (i) presence of asthma and/or atopy; (ii) spirometry measurements and (iii) serum C-reactive protein and leptin. Multiple regression was used to account for parental smoking, childhood age, gender and socioeconomic status. Results: 174 children with an average age of 12.1 (+/-0.6 SD), 48% of who were male were included in the analysis. Of the 174, 99 (57%) were in the normal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index group and 75 (43%) elevated umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index groups. The overall proportion of subjects with asthma was 28% (48/174) and atopy 56% (98/174). No association was found between elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index and asthma (p = .47) or atopy (p = .75) at age 12 years. Similarly there was no association between FEV1(%) (p = .96), forced vital capacity (FVC)(%) (p = .98), elevated serum C-reactive protein (p = .69) or leptin (p = .20) and an elevated fetal umbilical artery Doppler pulsatility index. Conclusions: An elevated umbilical artery Doppler at 28-weeks gestation in the absence of prematurity or fetal growth restriction is not associated with altered respiratory function or the presence of atopy in children aged 12 years. These findings support the theory that such disease has a multifactorial pathophysiology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we determined circulating levels of C-reactive protein, several cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules and angiogenic factors along with those of leptin in healthy non-pregnant and pregnant women and preeclamptic patients, and investigated whether serum leptin levels were related to the clinical characteristics and measured laboratory parameters of the study participants., METHODS: Sixty preeclamptic patients, 60 healthy pregnant women and 59 healthy non-pregnant women were involved in this case-control study. Levels of leptin and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 in maternal sera were assessed by ELISA. Serum levels of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra), IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70, IL-18, interferon (IFN)-gamma, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interferon-gamma-inducible protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP)-1, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 were determined by multiplex suspension array. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured by an autoanalyzer. Serum total soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) and biologically active placental growth factor (PlGF) levels were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. For statistical analyses, non-parametric methods were applied., RESULTS: There were significant differences in most of the measured laboratory parameters among the three study groups except for serum IL-1beta and TGF-beta1 levels. Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in preeclamptic patients and healthy pregnant women than in healthy non-pregnant women. Additionally, preeclamptic patients had significantly higher leptin levels as compared to healthy pregnant women. Serum leptin levels were independently associated with BMI in healthy non-pregnant women. In healthy pregnant women, both BMI and serum CRP concentrations showed significant positive linear association with leptin levels. There were significant positive correlations between serum leptin concentrations of healthy pregnant women and systolic blood pressure, as well as serum levels of IP-10, while their serum leptin levels correlated inversely with fetal birth weight. In preeclamptic patients, a significant positive correlation was observed between serum concentrations of leptin and IP-10. Furthermore, elevated serum leptin level and sFlt-1/PlGF ratio had an additive (joint) effect in the risk of preeclampsia, as shown by the substantially higher odds ratios of their combination than of either alone., CONCLUSIONS: Simultaneous measurement of leptin with several inflammatory molecules and angiogenic factors in this study enabled us to investigate their relationship, which can help to understand the role of circulating leptin in normal pregnancy and preeclampsia.

AB  - Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) offer promise as therapeutic aid in the repair of tendon and ligament injuries in race horses. Fetal adnexa is considered as an ideal source of MSCs due to many advantages, including non-invasive nature of isolation procedures and availability of large tissue mass for harvesting the cells. However, MSCs isolated from equine fetal adnexa have not been fully characterized due to lack of species-specific markers. Therefore, this study was carried out to isolate MSCs from equine umbilical cord blood (UCB) and characterize them using cross-reactive markers. The plastic-adherent cells could be isolated from 13 out of 20 (65 %) UCB samples. The UCB derived cells proliferated till passage 20 with average cell doubling time of 46.40 +/- 2.86 h. These cells expressed mesenchymal surface markers but did not express haematopoietic/leucocytic markers by RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry. The phenotypic expression of CD29, CD44, CD73 and CD90 was shown by 96.36 +/- 1.28, 93.40 +/- 0.70, 73.23 +/- 1.29 and 46.75 +/- 3.95 % cells, respectively in flow cytometry, whereas, reactivity against the haematopoietic antigens CD34 and CD45 was observed only in 2.4 +/- 0.20 and 0.1 +/- 0.0 % of cells, respectively. Osteogenic and chondrogenic differentiation could be achieved using established methods, whereas the optimum adipogenic differentiation was achieved after supplementing media with 15 % rabbit serum and 20 ng/ml of recombinant human insulin. In this study, we optimized methodology for isolation, cultural characterization, differentiation and immunophenotyping of MSCs from equine UCB. Protocols and markers used in this study can be employed for unequivocal characterization of equine MSCs.Copyright © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The aim of this work was to clarify whether maternal lithium chloride (LiCl) exposure disrupts the neonatal neuroendocrine-cytokine axis. Pregnant Wistar rats were orally administrated 50 mg LiCl/kg b.wt. from gestational day (GD) 1 to postpartum day 28. Maternal administration of LiCl induced a hypothyroid state in both dams and their neonates compared to the control dams and neonates at lactation days (LDs) 14, 21 and 28, where the levels of serum free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxin (FT4) were decreased and the level of serum thyrotropin (TSH) level was increased. A noticeable depression in maternal body weight gain, neonatal body weight and neonatal serum growth hormone (GH) was observed on all examined postnatal days (PNDs; 14, 21 and 28). A single abortion case was recorded at GD 17, and three dead neonates were noted at birth in the LiCl-treated group. Maternal administration of LiCl disturbed the levels of neonatal serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), interferon-gamma (INF-gamma), leptin, adiponectin and resistin at all tested PNDs compared to the control group. This administration produced a stimulatory action on the level of neonatal cerebral serotonin (5-HT) at PND 14 and on the level of neonatal cerebral norepinephrine (NE) at PNDs 21 and 28. However, this administration produced an inhibitory action on the level of neonatal cerebral dopamine (DA) at all examined PNDs and on the level of neonatal cerebral NE at PND 14 and the level of neonatal cerebral 5-HT at PNDs 21 and 28 compared to the corresponding control group. Thus, maternal LiCl exposure-induced hypothyroidism disrupts the neonatal neuroendocrine-cytokine system, which delay cerebral development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adipose tissue can release hormones into the blood stream in response to specific extracellular stimuli or changes in metabolic status. Resistin, an adipose-secreted factor, is primarily involved in the modulation of insulin sensitivity and adipocyte differentiation. Adiponectin, an adipocyte-specific hormone with insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects, is reduced in obesity and type II diabetes. The aim of the study was to assess the influence of maternal pre-existing diabetes on cord blood resistin and adiponectin at birth in relation to neonatal anthropometric parameters and cord blood insulin levels., MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 60 term newborns were prospectively enrolled and categorized into three groups: 20 were macrosomic infants of pre-gestational diabetic mothers (group I), 20 were non-macrosomic infants of pre-gestational diabetic mothers (group II) and 20 were healthy non-macrosomic infants born to non-diabetic mothers serving as controls (group III). Infants' anthropometric indices were recorded. Cord blood samples for glucose, insulin, resistin and adiponectin assay, together with maternal glycosylated haemoglobin were obtained., RESULTS: Serum insulin was increased while resistin and adiponectin were significantly decreased in infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) compared to the control group. Serum glucose, insulin, resistin and adiponectin were comparable in group I and II. Cord serum resistin correlated positively with cord blood glucose in IDMs in both macrosomic and non-macrosomic groups. Cord serum insulin correlated positively with triceps skinfold thickness in all studied neonates. Cord serum resistin and adiponectin showed no correlation with neonatal anthropometric indices. Multiple regression analysis demonstrated that insulin, resistin and adiponectin together were highly correlated with birth weight, with adiponectin as the one responsible for this positive correlation., CONCLUSIONS: Infants of diabetic mothers had elevated levels of cord serum insulin and suppressed levels of cord serum resistin and adiponectin, suggesting that the regulation of these metabolic pathways is probably operational before birth. Levels were comparable in both macrosomic and non-macrosomic neonates.

AB  - The prevalence of childhood obesity is increasing at an alarming rate in Malaysia. Metabolic changes during pregnancy are critical to the development of infant adiposity, due to imbalanced adipokines production. Hence, we aimed to investigate the association of maternal serum and breast milk adipokines with infant adiposity development. The study was conducted from April 2010 until December 2012. A total of 155 healthy pregnant mothers aged 19 to 40 years were recruited during the first and second trimester in Kelantan, Malaysia. Data consisted of maternal sociodemographic details, anthropometry and clinical biochemistry analysis; and the infant's anthropometry and feeding patterns. Maternal fasting serum and breast milk samples were analysed for adiponectin and leptin levels. Data collection was performed in the second and third trimester of pregnancy, and continued with follow-up visits at birth, two, six, and 12 months postpartum. Multiple linear regression (MLR) analyses were performed to examine the associations between maternal serum and breast milk adiponectin and leptin and infant adiposity development. MLR models showed that, in the first year, as maternal serum and breast milk adiponectin increased, infant weight, BMI-for-age Z scores and abdominal circumference significantly decreased (p < 0.05). Maternal serum and/or breast milk adiponectin was associated with first-year infant adiposity development.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction is one of the most common and complex problem of the modern obstetrics. Common diseases of the adult as well as obesity, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease appear to be related to the abnormal growing in the intrauterine life, in particular with intrauterine growth restriction. This paper aims to review some ultrasound markers (uterine artery Doppler velocimetry) and biomarkers (leptin, adiponectin, endothelin-1, lactate dehydrogenase, s-endoglin, growth factors secreted by placenta: soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor-1, Pregnancy-associated Plasma Protein A, metastin (kisspeptin-54), cited in the literature of the recent years, that can predict uteroplacental insufficiency preceding the fetal intrauterine growth restriction. As an immediate effect, intrauterine growth restriction is associated with perinatal morbidity and increased mortality. Detecting the markers with the highest degree of predictivity, the early identification of this intrauterine fetal vulnerability allows an optimal preventive healthcare actions.

AB  - A higher body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of maternal and perinatal complications. This study aimed to analyze selected parameters of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, including adipokines, in obese pre-pregnant women, and their influence on the birth weight of newborns., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group (O) consisted of 34 pregnant women with higher BMI (obese) before pregnancy. The control group (C) was 27 pregnant women with target BMI and physiological pregnancy. The BMI index: body weight [kg]/(height [m]2 was assessed on the first obstetrical visit. The research material was the serum of pregnant women collected in the third trimester of pregnancy and umbilical cord blood collected immediately after delivery. Selected parameters of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and adipokines were determined., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the study group and the control group concerning the concentrations of insulin, glucose, VLDL, adiponectin, TNF-alpha, HOMA-IR, as well as LDH and cholesterol in maternal blood serum and umbilical cord blood serum. Total cholesterol and HDL in both maternal blood serum and umbilical cord blood were statistically significantly lower than those in the control group. The concentration of triglycerides (TG) and resistin in the blood serum of obese mothers were higher than those in the control group (p < 0.05). However, no statistically significant differences were found between the two groups regarding the concentrations of TG and resistin in the umbilical cord blood. The concentration of LDL cholesterol in the umbilical blood serum in the obese group was statistically significantly lower than that in the control group. The concentration of leptin in maternal blood serum and umbilical cord blood serum in the study group was statistically significantly higher than that in the control group., CONCLUSIONS: Pregestational obesity does not substantially affect the basic parameters of carbohydrate metabolism in pregnant women, but it disturbs the lipid profile, which is manifested by a significant increase in triglycerides and a decrease in the level of HDL cholesterol in the serum. Preexisting obesity increases the concentration of leptin and resistin in the serum of pregnant women, which may be caused by the increased volume of adipose tissue. The concentrations of leptin and resistin in the blood of pregnant women correlate positively, and the concentrations of adiponectin and TNF-alpha negatively correlate with pre-pregnancy BMI values. There is a positive correlation between the concentration of leptin in the serum of umbilical cord blood and the birth weight of the newborn, which suggests that this parameter contributes to the pathomechanism of macrosomia.

AB  - Aim: To develop and validate high-sensitive (hs) ELISA method for detection of adipophilin (adipose differentiation-related protein, ADRP) in human breast milk (BM) and to analyze adipophilin levels in BM during 12 months of lactation. Methods: ADRP levels were determined using hsELISA method (Biovendor-Laboratory Medicine, Inc.) in colostrum (D0) and BM of 72 mothers was collected 1, 3, 6, and 12 months following delivery (M1, 3, 6, 12). Results: ADRP was detectable in BM up to 12 months of lactation. Mean levels at D0 were 1.98 +/- 0.12; M1, 2.83 +/- 0.21; M3, 2.39 +/- 0.17; M6, 2.57 +/- 0.16; and at M12 3.25 +/- 0.21 g/ml. Significantly higher levels of ADRP were found in M1 and M12 when compared to D0 and in M12 when compared to M3 (overall P = 0.0001). No significant correlation was seen between ADRP levels in BM and adiponectin, body weight of infants, their birth length, body weight gain during the first year of life, or BMI of mothers before pregnancy. Conclusions: We developed and validated hsELISA for detection of ADRP in human BM. ADRP was detectable in human BM during the whole 12 months of lactation period and its levels were intraindividually well-conserved. (C) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Maternal nutritional and metabolic status influence fetal growth. This study investigated the contribution of gestational weight gain (GWG), gestational diabetes (GDM), and maternal obesity to birthweight and newborn body fat. It is a secondary analysis of a prospective study including 204 women with a pregestational body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 kg/m2 and 219 women with BMI >= 30 kg/m2. GDM was screened in the second and third trimester and was treated by dietary intervention, and insulin if required. Maternal obesity had the greatest effect on skinfolds (+1.4 mm) and cord leptin (+3.5 ng/mL), but no effect on birthweight. GWG was associated with increased birthweight and skinfolds thickness, independently from GDM and maternal obesity. There was an interaction between third trimester weight gain and GDM on birthweight and cord leptin, but not with maternal obesity. On average, +1 kg in third trimester was associated with +13 g in birthweight and with +0.64 ng/mL in cord leptin, and a further 32 g and 0.89 ng/mL increase in diabetic mothers, respectively. Maternal obesity is the main contributor to neonatal body fat. There is an independent association between third trimester weight gain, birthweight, and neonatal body fat, enhanced by GDM despite intensive treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To discriminate the effect of maternal obesity and gestational diabetes on birth weight and adipose tissue of the newborn., METHODS: Normal BMI women (group N, n = 243; 18.5<= BMI<25 kg/m2) and obese women (group Ob, n = 253; BMI>=30 kg/m2) were recruited in a prospective study between 15 and 18 weeks of gestation. All women were submitted to a 75g oral glucose tolerance test in the second and third trimester. First trimester fasting blood glucose was also obtained from Ob women. All women with one measurement above normal values were considered positive for gestational diabetes and first treated by dietary intervention. When dietary measures were not efficient, they were treated by insulin. Neonatal anthropometrics, sum of skinfolds and cord serum hormones were measured., RESULTS: 222 N and 226 Ob mothers and their newborns were included in the analysis. Diabetes was diagnosed in 20% and 45.2% of N and Ob women, respectively. Birth weight was not statistically different between groups (boys: 3456g+/-433 and 3392g+/-463; girls: 3316g+/-402 and 3391g+/-408 for N and Ob, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that skinfold thickness and serum leptin concentrations were significantly increased in girls born to women with obesity (18.0mm+/-0.6 versus 19.7mm+/-0.5, p = 0.004 and 11.3ng/mL+/-1.0 versus 15.3ng/mL+/-1.0, p = 0.02), but not in boys (18.4mm+/-0.6 versus 18.5mm+/-0.5, p = 0.9 and 9.3ng/mL+/-1.0 versus 9.0ng/mL+/-1.0, p = 0.9). Based on data from 136 N and 124 Ob women, maternal insulin resistance at 37 weeks was also positively related to skinfold in girls, only, with a 1-point increase in HOMA-IR corresponding to a 0.33mm+/-0.08 increase in skinfold (p<0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of gestational diabetes, maternal obesity and insulin resistance were associated with increased adiposity in girls only. Persistence of this sexual dimorphism remains to be explored during infancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Few studies have examined whether the distinct metabolic patterns found in obese and nonobese pregnant women have different effects on the growing fetus. Our objective was to estimate the influence of longitudinal variation in maternal serum leptin levels on variation in infant birth weight in overweight/obese versus normal-weight women., DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 286 gravidas, maternal weight and serum leptin levels at 6-10, 10-14, 16-20, 22-26, and 32-36 weeks gestation were measured. Effects of leptin levels on infant birth weight adjusted for gestational age at delivery (aBW) were analyzed using a linear regression model that accounted for the relationship of time-varying predictors to the log-transformed leptin concentrations., RESULTS: Different relationships of aBW to maternal serum leptin and its rate of change across pregnancy were exhibited by overweight/obese and normal-weight gravidas. For normal-weight women, aBW is not associated with either the magnitude of the logarithm of the leptin concentration or with its rate of change in either the first or second half of pregnancy. Conversely, for overweight/obese women, an increase in the rate of change in maternal serum leptin in the second half of pregnancy is significantly associated with a decrease in aBW. This effect is distinct from that of maternal weight., CONCLUSION: Differences in the effect of maternal serum leptin on fetal growth between overweight/ obese and normal-weight women suggest metabolic and physiologic heterogeneity between these groups. Such differences may be involved in the long-term physiologic effects of the obese intrauterine environment on the health of the offspring. Copyright © 2012 The Obesity Society.

AB  - Atherosclerosis starts in childhood, and is accelerated in some individuals. A cluster of clinical and biochemical factors constitute the risk profile for many of them, perhaps most important being metabolic insulin resistance syndrome. Insulin resistance and its components for children and adolescents, especially obesity and dyslipidemia, are generators of hypertension, glucose intolerance and complications of atherosclerosis in adulthood. Some individuals are genetically predisposed, particularly those with the family history of such disorders. For many subjects, there is 'tracking' of metabolic and lifestyle factors from early age to adulthood. Several new risk factors of atherosclerosis (e.g. level of lipoprotein (a), procoagulant state, hyperhomocysteinemia, low birth weight and adverse in-utero environment, and possibly inflammatory markers) are current and potentially future areas of research concerning children and young individuals. Definition of and research on new and hitherto not investigated factors and formulation of strategies to neutralize the known factors are of paramount importance for primary prevention of atherosclerosis. Simple and effective measures for prevention include increasing awareness of the diseases, maintenance of ideal body weight, regular physical exercise, avoidance of smoking and chewing of tobacco, eating a balanced diet, and early periodic monitoring of blood pressure and metabolic status. These measures, starting from childhood, should be applied to all and in particular to the susceptible offspring, predisposed individuals, and populations.

AB  - Leptin is a satiety hormone secreted from the adipose tissue and human placenta. We previously demonstrated that severe preeclampsia up-regulated leptin mRNA expression in the placenta and elevated maternal plasma leptin concentrations. Preeclampsia is frequently related to generation of small for gestational age (SGA) infant especially in cases with severe preeclampsia. However, it is still controversial whether the increase in maternal plasma leptin levels is associated with fetal growth restriction without complication of preeclampsia. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to explore the relationship between maternal plasma leptin levels and fetal growth in non-preeclamptic (n = 98) and preeclamptic (n = 40) women. In non-preeclamptic pregnant women, plasma leptin levels in SGA group (n = 11) were significantly higher than those in appropriate for gestational age (AGA) group (n = 87, P<0.05). In pregnant women with preeclampsia, likewise, plasma leptin levels in SGA group (n = 15) were significantly higher than those in AGA group (n = 25, P<0.05). In multiple linear regression analysis, maternal BMI, mean arterial blood pressure and Delta SD of neonatal body weight were significant factors for determining maternal plasma leptin levels in all population studied. Maternal BMI and Delta SD of neonatal body weight showed positive correlation with maternal plasma leptin levels when analysis was performed in non-preeclamptic subjects alone. In conclusion, maternal plasma leptin levels reflect, at least partly, deterioration in fetal growth.

AB  - Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are prone to developing obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Adiponectin and leptin are adipocytokines associated with insulin sensitivity parameters. We aimed to relate serum adiponectin and leptin levels with insulin sensitivity parameters in prepuberal SGA children with and without catch-up growth (SGA+CUG; SGA-CUG, respectively) and to analyze the usefulness of these adipocytokines as early markers of insulin resistance. We analysed adiponectin, proinsulin, leptin, growth factors, insulin, HOMA IR and HOMA beta(cell) in 23 SGA+CUG, 26 SGA-CUG children compared with 48 prepuberal appropiate for gestational age (AGA). SGA children had adiponectin levels comparable to AGA children. Leptin levels were different between sexes, showed to be higher in SGA+CUG group (p=0.040) and these were significantly correlated with insulin sensitivity parameters. These results suggest leptin resistance as an adaptive mechanism to increase energy balance, but an altered functional response of adipocytes cannot be discarded.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to clarify the effects of maternal obesity on insulin sensitivity and secretion in offspring., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Fifty-one offspring of both sexes of obese (Ob group) and 15 offspring of normal-weight (control group) mothers were studied. Plasma glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were measured during an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Insulin sensitivity was calculated using the oral glucose insulin sensitivity index, and insulin secretion and beta-cell glucose sensitivity were computed by a mathematical model. Fasting leptin and adiponectin were also measured. Body composition was assessed by dual-X-ray absorptiometry., RESULTS: No birth weight statistical difference was observed in the two groups. Of the Ob group, 69% were obese and 19% were overweight. The Ob group were more insulin resistant than the control group (398.58 +/- 79.32 vs. 513.81 +/- 70.70 ml(-1) x min(-1) x m(-2) in women, P < 0.0001; 416.42 +/- 76.17 vs. 484.242 +/- 45.76 ml(-1) x min(-1) x m(-2) in men, P < 0.05). Insulin secretion after OGTT was higher in Ob group than in control group men (63.94 +/- 21.20 vs. 35.71 +/- 10.02 nmol x m(-2), P < 0.01) but did not differ significantly in women. beta-Cell glucose sensitivity was not statistically different between groups. A multivariate analysis of variance showed that maternal obesity and offspring sex concurred together with BMI and beta-cell glucose sensitivity to determine the differences in insulin sensitivity and secretion observed in offspring., CONCLUSIONS: Obese mothers can give birth to normal birth weight babies who later develop obesity and insulin resistance. The maternal genetic/epigenetic transmission shows a clear sexual dimorphism, with male offspring having a higher value of insulin sensitivity (although not statistically significant) associated with significantly higher insulin secretion than female offspring.

AB  - Bisphenol A and phthalates are widely detected in human urine, blood, breast milk, and amniotic fluid. Both bisphenol A and phthalates have been suggested as playing a role in obesity epidemics. Exposure to these chemicals during fetal development, and its consequences should be concerning because they can cross the placenta. Thus, this study aimed to assess the association between prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates, and cord blood metabolic-related biomarkers. Maternal serum was used during the first trimester, to determine prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and phthalates. Levels of metabolic-related biomarkers in the cord blood were also determined. Linear regression models were applied to the 365 participants with both, exposure and biomarker assessments, adjusted for maternal age, pre-pregnancy body mass index, parity, education, and sex of the child. The level of bisphenol A was negatively associated with the leptin level (beta = -0.06, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.11, -0.01), but was positively associated with the high-molecular-weight adiponectin level, with marginal significance (beta = 0.03, 95%CI: 0.00, 0.06). The mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP), mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), and summation of MEHP and MECPP to represent DEHP exposure (DEHPm) levels were inversely associated with the leptin levels (beta=-0.14, 95%CI: -0.27, -0.01; beta = -0.12, 95%CI: -0.24, 0.00 with marginal significance; beta=0.08, 95%CI: -0.14, -0.03; and beta = -0.09, 95%CI: -0.16, -0.03, respectively). The present study provided some evidence that prenatal exposure to bisphenol A and certain phthalates may modify fetal adiponectin and leptin levels. Copyright © 2017. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Studies have suggested associations between maternal obesity and mental health problems of their children. However, the underlying mechanism is largely unknown. A possible mechanism can be via inflammatory states and the other possible mechanism is metabolic hormone-induced programming. Cross-talk between adipokines, including inflammatory cytokines and metabolic hormones secreted from adipose tissue and the central nervous system needs to be further investigated to elucidate the mechanism. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate the association between fetal adipokine levels and child behavioral problems at preschool age. Cord blood adiponectin, leptin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) levels were measured and child behavioral problems were assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at preschool age. Logistic regression models adjusted by related maternal factors were performed to examine the association between cord blood adipokines and child behavioral problems. Three hundred and sixty-one children were included in the final analysis. A significant association between decreased hyperactivity/inattention and increased leptin was found (OR = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.06-0.89). Cord blood adiponectin, TNF-alpha and IL-6 levels were not associated with child behavioral problems. Our findings suggested that cord blood adipokines, particularly, leptin level, may be a predictor of hyperactivity/inattention problems at preschool age.

AB  - Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP) is one of the most widely used phthalates. Metabolites of DEHP are detectable in majority of the population. Findings on adverse health outcomes, particularly birth weight in association with prenatal exposure to DEHP remain equivocal. Besides, there is insufficient evidence to address influence on metabolic function from epidemiological studies. Thus, our objective was to investigate cord blood adipokine levels and birth size in association with prenatal DEHP exposure in prospective birth cohort study. Mono-2-methylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), primary metabolite of DEHP was determined as exposure by using maternal blood sample of 3rd trimester. Leptin and adiponectin levels in cord blood were measured as markers of metabolic function. Birth weight and length were obtained from birth record. Association between maternal MEHP levels and cord blood adiponectin and leptin levels, birth weight and ponderal index (PI) were examined for 167 mother-child pairs who had both MEHP and cord blood adipokine measurements. The median MEHP level was 8.81ng/ml and the detection rate was 100%. There was no sex difference in MEHP levels. Both leptin and adiponectin levels were higher in girls than in boys. MEHP level was positively associated with adiponectin level among boys and was negatively associated with leptin level among girls. MEHP level were negatively associated with PI only in girls and this could be due to decreased leptin level. This study suggested that prenatal DEHP exposure may be associated with cord blood adipokine and birth size. The influence potentially be sex-specific and could be more significant in girls.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are synthetic chemicals that persist in the environment and in humans. There is a possible association between prenatal PFASs exposure and both neonate adipokines and birth size, yet epidemiological studies are very limited. The objective of this study was to examine associations of prenatal exposure to PFASs with cord blood adipokines and birth size. We conducted birth cohort study, the Hokkaido Study. In this study, 168 mother-child pairs were included. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) in maternal blood were determined by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Cord blood adiponectin and leptin levels were measured by ELISA and RIA, respectively. Birth weight and ponderal index (PI) were obtained from birth record. The median maternal PFOS and PFOA were 5.1 and 1.4ng/mL, respectively. The median total adiponectin and leptin levels were 19.4mug/mL and 6.2ng/mL, respectively. Adjusted linear regression analyses found that PFOS level was positively associated with total adiponectin levels (beta=0.12, 95% CI:0.01, 0.22), contrary was negatively associated with PI (beta=-2.25, 95% CI: -4.01, -0.50). PFOA level was negatively associated with birth weight (beta=-197, 95% CI: -391, -3). Leptin levels were not associated with PFASs levels. PFOS and adiponectin levels showed marginal dose-response relationship and both PFOS and PFOA and birth size showed significant dose-response relationships. Results from this study suggested that prenatal PFASs exposure may alter cord blood adiponectin levels and may decrease birth size. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Normal-weight but high-percentage trunk fat phenotype was characterized in a setting where adiposity is not associated with educational and socioeconomic status. Body size trajectory since birth, current body composition measured using whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, cardiometabolic traits, serum adipokines, and dietary intake were measured cross-sectionally in 251 normal weight Japanese female university students whose fasting triglyceride and homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) averaged 56 mg/dL and 1.2, respectively. They were grouped according to tertile of percentage trunk fat. Although HOMA-IR did not differ among three groups, high-percentage trunk fat was associated with higher triglyceride and apolipoprotein B, and lower HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, weight-adjusted skeletal muscle mass (OR: 0.13, 95% CI: 0.04-0.38, p < 0.001), weight gain from birth to age 12 years (OR: 1.214 95% CI: 1.008-1.463 p = 0.04), and cereal consumption (OR:1.008, 95% CI: 1.000-1.016, p = 0.04) were associated with high-percentage trunk fat independent of birthweight, HOMA-IR, adipose tissue-insulin resistance index (the product of fasting insulin and free fatty acid), triglyceride, HDL cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1 and B, leptin, adiponectin, blood pressure, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein. Early childhood growth, lower skeletal muscle mass, and higher cereal consumption may be associated with normal-weight but high-percentage trunk fat phenotype in Japanese female university students in this subanalysis study. Atherogenic profile of lipids and apolipoproteins may be directly related to abdominal fat accumulation. Copyright © The Japan Diabetes Society 2023.

AB  - Normal weight insulin resistant phenotype was characterized in 251 Japanese female university students using homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance. Birth weight, body composition at age 20, cardiometabolic traits and dietary intake were compared cross-sectionally between insulin sensitive (< 1.6, n = 194) and insulin resistant (2.5 and higher, n = 16) women. BMI averaged < 21 kg/m2 and waist < 72 cm and did not differ between two groups. The percentage of macrosomia and serum absolute and fat-mass corrected leptin concentrations were higher in insulin resistant women although there was no difference in birth weight, fat mass index, trunk/leg fat ratio and serum adiponectin. In addition, resting pulse rate, serum concentrations of free fatty acids, triglycerides and remnant-like particle cholesterol were higher in insulin resistant women although HDL cholesterol and blood pressure did not differ. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, serum leptin (odds ratio:1.68, 95% confidential interval:1.08-2.63, p = 0.02) was associated with normal weight insulin resistance independently of macrosomia, free fatty acids, triglycerides, remnant-like particle cholesterol and resting pulse rate. In conclusion, normal weight IR phenotype may be associated with increased plasma leptin concentrations and leptin to fat mass ratio in young Japanese women, suggesting higher leptin production by body fat unit.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin resistance (IR) in adults has been associated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). Leptin and adiponectin correlations with anthropometric parameters and IR at 72 h in discordant twins were tested., METHODS: We included 24 discordant (birth weight discordance >=20% in relation to the heavier cotwin) and 30 concordant (birth weight discordance <=10%) twins., RESULTS: A correlation between leptin (but not adiponectin) level and birth weight (BW), birth length and head circumference in IUGR twins was recorded (p<0.05). Insulin sensitivity (IS) and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)-IR in IUGR twins were similar to appropriate-for-gestational-age cotwins and unrelated to adipokines. In IUGR twins, adiponectin and insulin associated positively. In larger concordant twins' leptin level correlated with HOMA-IR and insulin., CONCLUSIONS: Leptin, but not adiponectin, levels correlate positively with anthropometric parameters in IUGR twins. IR in IUGR twins is unrelated to adipokines in the first few days of life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is a risk factor for developing metabolic syndrome later in life. We explored whether adipokine concentrations in cord blood (CB) and on day 3 (D3) were related to impaired fetal growth and lipids in IUGR twins., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-six discordant (birth weight [BW] discordance >=20% calculated in relation to the heavier co-twins) and 42 concordant (BW discordance <= 10%) twin pairs were included., RESULTS: In IUGR twins, both adiponectin/BW and triglyceride (TG) levels were significantly higher, while total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were lower in CB. On D3, both leptin and HDL-C levels were significantly lower and TG levels were significantly higher in IUGR twins. In the discordant group, the alterations in lipids were not related to any adipokine., CONCLUSIONS: IUGR is related to lower leptin level and proatherogenic lipid profile (higher TG and lower HDL-C), which are not influenced by adipokine at birth.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MS) and obesity is an important risk factor for fetal complications like excessive fetal growth manifested by large for gestational age (LGA) and macrosomia, which is a consequence of metabolic disturbances present in the first trimester of pregnancy. The aim of this prospective observational study is to analyze the relationship between the first trimester biochemical and anthropometric parameters of fetuses with the incidence of their macrosomia and LGA so to early predict such complications in women with symptoms of MS. A total of 124 Caucasian women in singleton pregnancies who fulfilled MS criteria were enrolled into the study group and compared to 30 healthy pregnant controls. Patients' blood was drawn and sampled for analysis at 11 - 13(+6) weeks of gestation. Specific factors were analyzed in terms of influence on fetal growth and perinatal morbidity in both pregnancy groups. The maternal parameters obtained at first trimester that with respect to controls proved influential towards macrosomia defined as > 4000 g were: BMI and weight (28.0 versus 22 m/kg(2); P < 0.001), (77.9 kg versus 60.8 kg; P < 0.001), fasting glucose (87.2 versus 82.1 mg/dl; P < 0.042), significantly higher s-E-selectin concentration (32.0 versus 24.5 ng/ml; P < 0.011) and lower adiponectin: (5.6 versus 9.1 mu g/ml; P < 0.001). Similarly, the parameters for LGA fetuses were found to be: maternal weight (80.3 versus 60.8 kg; P < 0.001), BMI (28.7 versus 21.6 kg/m(2); P < 0.001), fasting glucose (87.2 versus 82.4mg/dl; P < 0.022), increased s-E-selectin (30.8 versus 24.5 ng/ml; P < 0.022) and decreased adiponectin (6.3 versus 8.2 mu g/ml; P < 0.024). We concluded that: 1) first trimester BMI with cut-off of 25.5 was significant risk factor for excessive fetal growth; 2) maternal glycemia, as well as adiponectin and soluble E-selectin serum concentration in the first trimester of pregnancy could be predictive of LGA and fetal macrosomia; 3) maternal weight at 11 - 13(+6) weeks of pregnancy cut-off 67 kg had high sensitivity and specificity in detecting LGA and fetal macrosomia.

Obesity is considered as a main reason of the increasing incidence of T2DM, however, not all obese have T2DM. The risk for T2DM increases not only an excess of total fat but mainly the mass of visceral fat depot. Visceral fat leads to the development of insulin resistance by adipokines, proinflammatory cytokines, and lipids. It also predisposes to increased fatty acid storage in muscles, heart, liver, and blood vessels. Factors predisposing to T2DM involve sedentary life-style, unfavorable eating habits as well as low birth weight and overfeeding in early life. It has been suggested that the development of obesity and T2DM might be associated with a low-grade, chronic, autoimmune inflammation induced by glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity. The risk for T2DM is increased not only in obese but also in normal weight individuals who have excess of total fat or increased visceral fat mass. Conclusions. 1. Almost all patients with T2DM are overweight or obese. 2. Almost all patients with T2DM have visceral obesity. 3. Among normal weight subjects, there are subgroups with excess fat and/or its unfavorable distribution that are prone to T2DM in the same degree as obese individuals. 4. Regular physical activity is the best way for prevention and treatment of obesity and T2DM.Copyright © 2012, Polish Society of Family Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Perinatal leptin exposure may modulate the risk of adiposity in early childhood. In previous analyses, negative associations between maternal (32 weeks' gestation) and cord blood leptin and offspring body composition at 2 years were observed., METHODS: Associations between maternal/cord blood leptin were assessed with indirect (i.e., body weight, BMI percentiles, sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses), and direct (i.e., ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging in a subgroup) growth and adipose tissue (AT) measurements in 120 children aged 3 to 5 years., RESULTS: Maternal leptin was not shown to be associated with offspring body composition in univariate analyses. In adjusted analyses, some weak negative associations were observed with weight and BMI percentiles but not with sum of 4 skinfold thicknesses or calculated body fat at 3 to 5 years. Cord blood leptin was inversely related to offspring body composition, but effect sizes were small and not consistently statistically significant. No evidence of associations with direct AT measurements was observed., CONCLUSIONS: Although some negative relationships with indirect measurements of AT mass were observed, the results of this study do not provide sufficient evidence that maternal plasma or cord blood leptin is clinically relevant predictors of obesity or body fat distribution in early childhood.

AB  - BackgroundResearch indicates that breast milk contains bioactive components that influence metabolism in infancy and may play a role in the prevention of obesity in early childhood. In our initial study, 147 breastfeeding mother/child pairs were followed from birth to 2 years of age to examine the relationship between breast milk leptin and total adiponectin (collected at 6 weeks and 4 months postpartum) and infant body composition. Higher breast milk total adiponectin was related to greater fat mass and weight gain in children at 1 and 2 years of age, whereas leptin showed no association. Objectives/MethodsIn this follow-up, we examined the relationship between both adipokines and children's body weight, body mass index percentiles, sum of four skin-folds, percentage of body fat, fat mass and lean body mass at 3, 4 and 5 years of age. ResultsBreast milk adipokines were largely unrelated to child anthropometric measures. ConclusionOur results do not provide significant evidence that breast milk adipokines can predict adiposity in preschool children.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Few human studies have explored the role of adiponectin in early life on growth and adipose tissue development., METHODS: High molecular weight (HMW) and total adiponectin levels from 141 cord blood samples and plasma blood samples from 40 3-y-old children were analyzed. Associations between adiponectin levels in cord blood and child plasma, and infant/child growth and fat mass measurements up to the age of 5 y were assessed using linear regression models., RESULTS: HMW cord blood adiponectin was positively associated with weight, BMI percentiles, and lean body mass at birth only. At 3 and 4 y, positive associations were found with cord blood adiponectin and sum of four skinfold thickness measures and percentage of body fat following adjustment for maternal and child covariates, but did not persist at 5 y. There was no significant evidence of an association between child plasma HMW adiponectin and growth or body composition characteristics at 3-5 y., CONCLUSION: Our results do not support the hypothesis that HMW cord blood adiponectin is a useful biomarker for the prediction of adiposity at the age of 5 y. Additionally, there is no evidence that plasma HMW adiponectin levels predict body fat distribution between 3-5 y.

AB  - Small size at birth may result from fetal undernutrition which may occur at different times during gestation. Early postnatal catch-up growth and excess childhood weight gain are associated with an increased risk of adult cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus. The aim of this study was to assess the relative contributions of body composition and energy expenditure on fasting insulin sensitivity during late childhood. We took advantage of two previously described prospective cohorts of children born either at term or prematurely, with a wide range of birth weights adjusted for gestational age. Seventy-one prepubertal children (mean age 7.5 +/- 0.3 years) were examined: 23 term SGA (8 M, 15 F), 12 preterm SGA (7 M, 5 F), 16 term AGA (8 M, 8 F), and 20 preterm AGA (9 M, 11 F). Mean height SDS was -0.18 +/- 0.11 and mean BMI SDS was 0.27 +/- 0.03. Change in weight SDS was significantly higher in children born SGA compared to their AGA counterparts (p < 0.001). Change in weight SDS was highly correlated with fasting insulin (p < 0.03) and leptin (p < 0.001). Fasting insulin correlated only with serum leptin levels. Body composition appeared to be the main determinant of fasting leptin levels. No differences in lipid profile were observed between the different groups. There was a clear tendency to higher insulin and leptin levels in children born SGA compared with their AGA counterparts. IGF-I levels were significantly higher only in SGA term compared to AGA term. Resting energy expenditure (REE) was lower in SGA born at term and higher in SGA born preterm compared to their AGA counterparts. In conclusion, fasting insulin sensitivity is mainly determined by leptin levels which in turn are determined by body composition. IGF-I and REE showed a divergent pattern in SGA term compared to SGA preterm groups. IGF-I levels were determined only by weight change from birth to age 2 years, which may not be as pronounced in VLBW children compared to SGA term and thus may preclude a difference in IGF-I levels in the group of preterm children. The divergent effect in REE in SGA born at term compared to SGA born preterm compared to their AGA counterparts may explain the divergent effects on IGF-I. This difference might be a consequence of different timing in the exposure to intrauterine nutritional deficiency.

AB  - Maternal nutrition and the intrauterine environment are important in determining susceptibility to reproductive and metabolic disturbances. Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are widely consumed in Western diet. The purpose of this study was to determine whether perinatal exposure to a high levels of dietary AGEs affect metabolic and reproductive parameters in female mice offspring. Female CD1 mice, 7 weeks old, were placed on either a diet low (L-AGE) or high (H-AGE) in AGEs before mating and then during pregnancy and lactation. All offspring were weaned onto the L-AGE diet and studied through to 16 weeks of age; they were counted and weighed at birth and then every week for a total of 11 weeks. Vaginal opening, litter size, growth curve, liver and abdominal fat weights, serum levels of anti-Mullerian hormone, leptin and adiponectin, as well as insulin and glucose tolerance tests were compared. Ovaries were harvested for follicular count and gene expression by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Compared to perinatal exposure to the LAGE diet, perinatal exposure to the H-AGE diet caused lower body weight at birth, and adult offspring exhibited delayed growth, lower serum leptin and adiponectin levels, delayed vaginal opening, irregular oestrous cyclicity, arrested follicular development and significant alterations in the expression of genes involved in folliculogenesis (Amh and Amhr2) and steroidogenesis (Cyp19a1). These results indicate that perinatal exposure to a diet elevated in AGEs causes deficits in perinatal growth, pubertal onset, and reproductive organ development in female mice. Whether these findings translate to humans remains to be determined in future studies.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess the adiponectin and visfatin concentrations in small-for-gestational age (SGA), appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA), and large-for-gestational age (LGA) newborns and their mothers. Sixty parturients giving birth to 20 term AGA singleton infants, 20 term singleton SGA infants, and 20 term singleton LGA infants were included into the study., RESULTS: Mean visfatin levels were found significantly higher in the SGA (p < 0.001) and LGA (p < 0.001) groups, and adiponectin levels were found significantly lower in the SGA group (p < 0.001) when compared with the AGA group. The SGA and LGA groups had higher insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR in comparison with the AGA group. The visfatin, glucose levels, and HOMA-IR (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, and p: 0.002, respectively) were higher in the LGA group than SGA group., CONCLUSION: We found significantly higher insulin and visfatin levels in LGA neonates and lower adiponectin levels in SGA neonates. We concluded that the relationship between adiponectin and visfatin and insulin sensitivity (metabolic disturbances) is very complex with little evidence of correlation in SGA and LGA neonates.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the impact of maternal sleep in late pregnancy on birth weight (BW) and leptin and lipid levels in umbilical cord blood., STUDY DESIGN: A total of 277 healthy and singleton pregnancy women were recruited for participation in the Shanghai Sleep Birth Cohort Study (SSBC) during their 36-38 weeks of pregnancy, from May 2012 to July 2013. Maternal night sleep time (NST), sleep efficiency (SE), sleep onset latency (SOL) and the percentage of wake after sleep onset (WASO) in NST and midpoint of sleep (MSF) were measured by actigraphy for seven consecutive days. The leptin and lipid levels were determined in cord blood samples collected from the umbilical vein immediately after delivery. Birth information (birth weight, gender, delivery type, etc.) was extracted from medical records. A multivariable linear regression model was applied to examine the effect of maternal sleep in late pregnancy on newborn leptin and lipid levels in umbilical cord blood., RESULTS: A total of 177 women and their infants were included in the analysis. Maternal mean NST was 7.03 +/- 1.10 h in late pregnancy, and 48% had a shorter sleep time (NST < 7 h). The average maternal SE was 72.54% +/- 9.66%. The mean percentage WASO/NST was 21.62% +/- 9.98%; the average MSF was about 3:34 (0:53); and the SOL was 46.78 +/- 36.00 min. After adjustment for confounders, both maternal NST and SE were found to be significantly associated with triglyceride levels (beta = -0.219, p = 0.006; beta = -0.224, p = 0.006) in umbilical cord blood; and maternal NST was also observed to have positive association with newborn leptin levels (beta = 0.146, p = 0.047). However, we did not find significant association between other maternal sleep parameters in late pregnancy and leptin and lipid levels and birth weight., CONCLUSIONS: Short sleep duration and poor sleep quality during late pregnancy were associated with newborn leptin and lipid levels, and efforts on improving maternal sleep during late pregnancy should be advocated for children's health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies have shown that cytokines play a role in bone remodeling., METHODS: In 1993, all hospital births occurred in Pelotas (Brazil) were identified and a total of 5249 newborns were included in the present cohort. Sub-samples of this cohort were visited during childhood and all members were traced at 11, 15, 18 and 22 years old. At 18 and 22 years the following biomarkers were measured: IL-6, CRP and adiponectin (the last one in a sub-sample) and bone mineral density (BMD-mg/cm2) was evaluated at 22 years. Crude regression analysis as well as adjusted for confounders (birth weight, pregnancy maternal smoking, gestational age, skin color, schooling, income, smoking, alcohol, physical activity, medical diagnosis of asthma, diabetes and hypertension, BMI, height, calcium intake, corticosteroid use, age at menarche, insulin and testosterone) were performed between the three biomarkers and the whole-body, lumbar spine and femoral BMD., RESULTS: No statistical significant association was found between IL-6 and CRP with BMD, in males. Significant inverse association in the adjusted analysis, among females, was found for the highest tertiles of CRP at 22 y (beta - 15.2 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -25.4; - 4.9; p = 004), of CRP and IL-6 at 22 years (beta - 20.0 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -31.7; - 8.3; p = 0.003), and of IL-6 and CRP at both ages (beta - 20.3 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -38.0; - 2.5; p = 0.001) with total body BMD. Significant association, among males, was also found between the highest tertile of adiponectin at 22 y (beta - 23.3 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -35.5; - 11.1; p = < 001; beta - 22.5 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -42.9; - 2.2; p = 0.03; and beta - 31.8 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -55.5; - 9.1; p = 0.006) and total body, lumbar spine and femur neck BMD, respectively; and, among females, - 17.8 mg/cm2; 95% CI: -34.9; - 0.9; p = 0.033, with lumbar spine BMD., CONCLUSION: CRP at 22 years, in females, seems to be a marker for total body BMD; adiponectin at 22 years is also a marker for BMD at the three sites, in males, and for lumbar spine BMD, in females.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small-for-gestational newborn babies may have long-term metabolic consequences. Among the main hormones possibly involved in foetal growth regulation are the IGFs, IGFBPs and the recently described ghrelin., OBJECTIVE: To examine the levels of desacyl-ghrelin, IGF-1, IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3 in children Small-for-gestational age (SGA) and children adequate-for-gestational age (AGA)., DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional and comparative study., SUBJECTS: We included 40 children SGA and 40 children AGA., MEASUREMENTS: Blood sample was taken a week after birth and measuring hormonal levels were done by ELISA., RESULTS: SGA babies had lower IGF-1, IGFBP-3 and leptin levels, but higher ghrelin and IGFBP-1 levels. Birth weight was associated independently with ghrelin and IGFBP-1 (negatively) and IGFBP-3 (positively). Ghrelin circulating levels were associated negative and independently with IGFBP-3 and triglycerides in the mother., CONCLUSIONS: We interpreted these findings to indicate that diminished body weight in newborns induce different adaptive signals, some of them mediated by IGF-1/IGFBP-3, ghrelin or by IGFBP-1. This regulation is congruent with the proposed role of ghrelin to adaptation to under-nutrition favouring lipid accumulation. CONCyTEG grant number 05-16-K117-028.

AB  - Objectives: Calorie restriction (CR) is an important intervention for reducing adiposity and improving glucose homeostasis. Recently we found that in rats, a severe calorie restriction (SCR) beginning at birth up to adult age promotes positive effects on cardiometabolic risk factors and heart. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of this new model of SCR on adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis of rats and to evaluate the effects of refeeding. Methods: From birth to 90 d of age, rats were divided into an ad libitum (AL) group, which had free access to food, and a CR50 group, which had food limited to 50% of that consumed by the AL group. From this moment, half of the CR50 animals had free access to food (the refeeding group [CR50-R]), and the other half continued 50% restricted for an additional 90-d period. Food intake was assessed daily and body weight weekly. In the final week of the SCR/refeeding protocol, oral glucose and intraperitoneal insulin tolerance tests were performed. Thereafter, rats were sacrificed and visceral fat was collected and used for histologic and Western blot analysis. Results: Findings from this study revealed that SCR beginning at birth and up to adult life promoted a large decrease in visceral adiposity; improvement in glucose/insulin tolerance; and upregulation of adipose proliferating cell nuclear antigen, sirtuin 1, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, and adiponectin. Refeeding abolished all of these effects. SCR from birth to adult age promoted beneficial effects on adipose tissue and glucose homeostasis; whereas refeeding abolished these effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small for gestational age (SGA) birth has been associated with adipocyte dysfunction during later phases of life. Because SGA women are at a higher risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), adipocyte dysfunction detected in patients with PCOS may be associated with SGA birth., AIMS: To determine whether SGA birth is related to altered serum markers of adipose tissue dysfunction during the third decade of life in Brazilian women. A secondary objective was to relate the presence of PCOS with serum markers of adipose tissue dysfunction., STUDY DESIGN: Prospective cohort observational study., SUBJECTS: A total of 384 women born at 37 to 42weeks of gestation from June 1, 1978 to May 31, 1979 in Ribeirao Preto, State of Sao Paulo, Brazil. After exclusion, 165 women participated in the study. Of these women, 43 were in the SGA group and 122 were in the adequate for gestational age group based on birth weight determined from cohort files., OUTCOME MEASURES: Body mass index (BMI), arterial systolic and diastolic pressures, abdominal circumference and serum concentrations of total testosterone, fasting glucose and insulin, lipid profile, adiponectin, leptin and necrosis factor alpha tumor (TNFalpha)., RESULTS: BMI was an independent predictor of lower adiponectin (adjusted coefficient=-0.02, p=0.01) and higher leptin (adjusted coefficient=0.06, p=0.01) concentrations. The serum insulin concentration was associated with higher leptin (adjusted coefficient=0.03, p=0.02) and TNF-alpha (adjusted coefficient=0.01, p=0.03) concentrations. Having PCOS or being born SGA did not predict any markers of adipocyte dysfunction. Copyright © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective. Growing evidence suggests that concentration of the adipocytokines leptin and adiponectin may be affected by risk of hypertension during pregnancy. Leptin and leptin receptor gene expression has been studied in placentas obtained from pre-eclamptic patients, but not in those with chronic high blood pressure (CHBP). Adiponectin receptors remain unstudied in placentas obtained from hypertensive patients. Methods. Therefore, we investigated relative mRNA expression of selected adipocytokine genes (leptin, leptin receptors (LEPRA, LEPRB, LEPRC, LEPRD) and adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR1, ADIPOR2)) in placental tissues from women with pre-eclampsia (n = 6) or CHBP (n = 8). Placentas from 28 normotensive patients were analyzed as controls. mRNA extracted from biopsies taken from the maternal and fetal sides of the placenta was investigated using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results. Compared with controls, significant increases in leptin mRNA expression were seen in placentas from preeclamptic patients on the maternal (p = 0.01) and fetal (p = 0.02) sides, and in placentas from CHBP mothers on the fetal side (p = 0.001). Maternal-side tissue from CHBP patients was not significantly different from that of controls (p = 0.08), but this might be due to the small sample size. No significant differences were seen in mRNA expression for most of the adipocytokine receptors tested for hypertensive cases compared with controls. However, there was a decrease in LEPRC (pre-eclamptic, maternal side, p = 0.03) and LEPRD (pre-eclamptic, maternal side, p 0.01; CHBP, fetal side, p = 0.009) in case-control analysis. Conclusions. This pilot study shows that increases seen in leptin expression in placentas from hypertensive mothers might be a consequence of defects in placentation associated with this disease, and motivates further region-specific adipocytokine gene expression analysis across this organ.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The discovery of a role for leptin in controlling fetal and neonatal growth suggests a fetal origin of some adult chronic diseases and has stimulated research into the mechanisms of action of leptin early in life. The aim of this study was to determine umbilical cord blood leptin levels and to evaluate their association with newborn growth indices., METHODS: Two hundred healthy newborns (89 males, 110 females, and one of undetermined gender; gestational ages ranging from 34-43 weeks) and their healthy mothers were enrolled in this study conducted at Moovsavi Hospital in Zanjan, Iran. The body size index of each newborn was determined in terms of birth weight, birth length, head circumference, body mass index (BMI) and ponderal index. Umbilical cord blood leptin levels were measured by ELISA., RESULTS: Umbilical cord leptin concentration was found to positively correlate with birth weight (r=0.322; p<0.0001), neonatal BMI (r=0.247; p<0.0001), ponderal index (r=0.206; p=0.04), and gestational age (r=0.221; p=0.002). There was no significant correlation between cord leptin and birth length or umbilical glucose concentration. Umbilical cord leptin concentrations (15.20+/-12.3 vs. 12.08+/-11.7; p=0.01) were significantly greater in female as compared to male newborns, respectively. Linear regression analysis indicated that umbilical cord leptin levels correlated with birth weight, umbilical triglyceride concentration, neonatal gender, and method of delivery., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings confirm the association of leptin concentrations with weight gain in fetal and newborn infants.

AB  - Adipose tissue seems to be a pivotal organ in the aging process. We investigated whether healthy aging could have its roots in a sound metabolic condition from the first year of life by evaluating leptin and adiponectin levels in neonates [33 adequate for gestational age (AGA) and 29 small for gestational age (SGA)], 48 centenarians, and 50 healthy elderly subjects. At birth, SGA neonates showed lower leptin levels (SGA 0.88 +/- 0.28; AGA 2.22 +/- 0.91 ng/mL; p < 0.05) and comparable adiponectin levels with respect to AGA. At 1 year, SGA showed increased leptin (SGA 1.74 +/- 0.28; AGA 1.31 +/- 0.19 ng/mL) and slightly reduced adiponectin concentrations (SGA 35.51 +/- 2.53; AGA 38.56 +/- 3.18 microg/mL) than AGA. Centenarians showed lower leptin (centenarians 18.71 +/- 3.78; elderly 34.81 +/- 7.27 ng/mL; p < 0.05) and higher adiponectin levels (centenarians 55.63 +/- 7.7; elderly 33.51 +/- 4.1 microg/mL; p < 0.05) than elderly subjects. Centenarians, like AGA infants during the first year of life, show a favorable adipokine profile, suggesting that the metabolic condition at early age could affect the longevity of an individual.

AB  - ObjectiveGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has been associated with inflammation as well as Vitamin D insufficiency. While Vitamin D has anti-inflammatory properties, relationships between Vitamin D and inflammatory markers remain unexplored in GDM. Therefore, this case--control study investigated adipocytokine and Vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations and correlations in GDM and control women, as well as their neonates. Design/Participants/Measurementsseventy-three women participated: 36 GDM and 37 controls. Maternal samples were drawn at 31weeks. Umbilical arterial and venous samples were collected at birth. 25(OH)D and adipocytokine concentrations were compared for GDM vs control maternal, umbilical arterial and venous samples. Correlations were explored between biochemical results, maternal and neonatal demographics. ResultsCompared with age- and weight-matched control participants, GDM women had significantly lower concentrations of 25(OH)D (773243 vs 932 +/- 192nm/l; P=0009); adiponectin (175 +/- 118 vs 341 +/- 203g/ml, P<0001); resistin (254 +/- 91 vs 319 +/- 121ng/ml, P=0045); and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) 139 +/- 100 vs 210 +/- 126ng/ml, P=0038), while delivering 1week earlier (382 +/- 12 vs 395 +/- 09weeks, P<0001). GDM maternal 25(OH)D concentrations positively correlated with PAI-1, IL-8 and TNF- concentrations. Umbilical 25(OH)D concentrations were not significantly different in GDM vs control offspring, whereas adiponectin, resistin and PAI-1 concentrations were significantly lower in GDM offspring. ConclusionsGDM women had lower 25(OH)D concentrations than controls, while neonatal umbilical concentrations of 25(OH)D did not differ. GDM maternal and GDM offspring had lower adiponectin, resistin and PAI-1 concentrations compared with controls. Results suggest that both GDM women and their offspring demonstrate abnormal adipocytokine patterns.

AB  - Introduction Obesity is characterized by elevated lipids, insulin resistance and relative hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, reducing fertility and increasing risk of pregnancy complications and birth defects. We termed this phenotype `Reprometabolic Syndrome' and showed that it can be recapitulated by acute infusions of lipid/insulin into healthy, normal weight, eumenorrheic women. Herein, we examined the broader impact of hyperlipidemia and euglycemic hyperinsulinemia on anterior pituitary trophic hormones and their targets. Methods Serum FSH, LH, TSH, growth hormone (GH), prolactin (PRL), thyroid hormones (free T4, total T3), cortisol, IGF-1, adiponectin, leptin and creatinine were measured in a secondary analysis of an interventional crossover study of 12 normal weight cycling women who underwent saline and heparin (control) infusion, or a euglycemic insulin infusion with heparin and Intralipid (R) (lipid/insulin), between days 2-5 in sequential menstrual cycles. Results In contrast to the decrease in gonadotropins, FSH and LH, infusion of lipid/insulin had no significant effects on other trophic hormones; TSH, PRL or GH. Thyroid hormones (fT4 and total T3), cortisol, IGF-1, adiponectin and creatinine also did not differ between saline or lipid/insulin infusion conditions. Leptin increased in response to lipid/insulin (p<0.02). Conclusion Acute hyperlipidemia and hyperinsulinemia exerted differential, cell type specific effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal, adrenal and thyroid axes. Elucidation of mechanisms underlying the selective modulation of pituitary trophic hormones, in response to changes in diet and metabolism, may facilitate therapeutic intervention in obesity-related neuroendocrine and reproductive dysfunction.

AB  - ObjectiveTo determine the effect of serial weighing and dietary advice compared with standard antenatal care on obstetric outcomes. DesignRandomised controlled clinical trial. SettingAustralian tertiary obstetric hospital. PopulationThree hundred and eighty-two overweight or obese non-diabetic pregnant women at less than 20 weeks gestation with a singleton pregnancy. MethodsWomen were randomised to targeted, serial self-weighing and simple dietary advice, (intervention), or standard antenatal care (control). Main outcomes measuresThe primary outcome was a reduction in a composite of obstetric complications: gestational hypertension, pre-eclampsia, diabetes, assisted or caesarean birth, shoulder dystocia, severe perineal trauma, postpartum haemorrhage and maternal high dependency care. Secondary outcomes were gestational weight gain at 36 weeks' gestation, quality of life (QOL) and maternal serum levels of 28-week leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein (CRP). ResultsThere was no difference in the rate of the primary composite outcome of obstetric complications: 124/184 (67% control), 124/187 (66% intervention) [relative risk 0.98 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.85-1.14)]. There was no difference in mean gestational weight gain [-0.9 kg (95% CI -2.0, 0.25)], QOL or leptin, adiponectin or CRP levels between intervention and control groups. ConclusionsThis low-cost, pragmatic intervention failed to prevent obstetric complications or modify maternal biochemistry or gestational weight gain in overweight or obese pregnant women. Participation in the study did not impair participants' QOL. Tweetable abstractSerial self-weighing and dietary advice failed to reduce obstetric complications in overweight pregnant women.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We tested the hypothesis that the maternal leptin concentration would be increased in preeclampsia, independent of maternal obesity., STUDY DESIGN: Maternal and cord plasma leptin concentrations were compared in 2 groups of women with either preeclampsia (n = 24) or normal pregnancy (n = 24), matched 1:1 for prepregnancy body mass index and fetal gestational age at sampling., RESULTS: Median leptin concentrations were significantly higher (P <. 03) in women with preeclampsia (45.6 ng/mL) than in normal pregnant women (27.0 ng/mL) and fell rapidly shortly after delivery (26.7 ng/mL and 25.4 ng/mL, respectively). Cord leptin was not significantly different between groups (5.4 ng/mL and 5.8 ng/mL, respectively). Maternal and cord leptin correlated significantly (rho = 0.76, P <.01) only in preeclampsia., CONCLUSION: Preeclampsia is associated with an increase in maternal plasma leptin concentrations that strongly correlates with the fetal cord concentration at delivery.

AB  - Pregnancy is a period of serial metabolic and hormonal changes in the woman's body. Factors such as circulating adipokines affect the fetal period and may cause long-term changes in metabolic pathways at the cellular, tissue, or organ level. The nutritional status of the pregnant woman affects the course of pregnancy, delivery, and confinement, as well as the health of the offspring following birth and in subsequent years. Adipokine hormones essential for modulating metabolism during pregnancy include adiponectin and leptin. This study aimed to assess maternal anthropometric parameters and plasma concentrations of specific adipokines as predictive measures of newborn birth weight, birth length, and ponderal index. Anthropometric measurements (prepregnancy body weight and height) were obtained from 168 surveyed Polish women. Data related to the birth parameters of 168 newborns (body length and mass) were derived from clinical records. Circulating maternal adiponectin and leptin levels at birth were determined. Significant correlations between newborn birth weight and maternal prepregnancy body mass index (p < 0.05) or maternal weight gain during pregnancy (p < 0.05) were observed. Women with below normal weight gain during pregnancy were more likely to give birth to newborns with significantly lower birth weight than women with excessive weight gain during pregnancy (p < 0.05). Maternal plasma concentrations of leptin were significantly related to prepregnancy maternal body mass index (p < 0.05), and concentrations of adiponectin and leptin were significantly related to weight gain during pregnancy (p < 0.05). However, they did not affect the birth parameters of the newborn.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Chemerin, a novel adipokine, has been implicated in adipogenesis, inflammation, and metabolism. The aims of this study were to determine the presence of chemerin in cord blood and its association with birthweight., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included the following: (1) twins with (n = 24) or without (n = 28) birthweight discordancy; and (2) singletons subclassified into small-for-gestational-age (SGA; n = 18); appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 33); and large-for-gestational-age (LGA; n = 8). Cord blood chemerin was determined. Parametric and nonparametric statistics were used for analysis., RESULTS: The results of the study included the following: (1) within the discordant twins group, the median chemerin concentration was significantly lower in the SGA group than in their cotwins; (2) within singletons, the median chemerin concentration was significantly higher in the LGA than the AGA newborns; and (3) the regression model revealed that chemerin was independently associated with birthweight., CONCLUSION: Cord blood chemerin is present in cord blood and its concentrations are positively correlated with birthweight. These novel findings support a role of adipokines in fetal growth. Copyright © 2012 Mosby, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the association between cord blood adiponectin and leptin and early infant growth at one year in small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants., STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective study adiponectin and leptin concentrations were determined in cord blood of (i) AGA newborns (n = 44) and (ii) SGA newborns (n = 24). At one year of age, height and weight were measured. Linear regression analysis was used to determine which factors were associated with anthropometric measurements at the age of one year., RESULTS: (i) SGA neonates had a significantly lower median cord blood adiponectin and leptin than AGA neonates; (ii) among SGA neonates, cord blood adiponectin concentrations were negatively correlated with body weight at one year, weight gain after one year and with BMI at one year; and (iii) among AGA neonates cord blood adiponectin concentrations were negatively correlated with body weight at one year, weight gain after one year and with BMI at one year., CONCLUSION: The disparity in cord blood adiponectin and leptin concentrations between SGA and AGA neonates suggests a role for adipokines in fetal growth.

AB  - Objective: Adipokines (cytokines produced by adipose tissue) play a major role in the control of body weight and energy distribution. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), only recently recognized as an adipokine, has been proposed to modulate systemic insulin sensitivity. The goal of this study was to determine whether there is an association between maternal plasma RBP4 concentration and the birth of a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborn in women with and without gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Study design: This cross-sectional study included pregnant women at term in the following groups: 1) normal pregnancy with an appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) neonate (n=64); 2) normal pregnancy with an LGA neonate (n=44); 3) GDM with an AGA neonate (n=55); and 4) GDM with an LGA neonate (n=42). Maternal plasma RBP4 concentration was determined by ELISA. Parametric and non-parametric statistics were used for analyses. Results: 1) Patients with GDM, either with AGA or LGA neonates, had a higher median plasma concentration of RBP4 than normal pregnant women who delivered an AGA neonate (P=0.01 and P=0.008, respectively); 2) mothers without GDM but with LGA neonates had a higher median plasma concentration of RBP4 than those with normal pregnancy and AGA newborns (P=0.001); 3) these findings remained significant after adjusting for maternal age, body mass index and gestational age at blood sampling. Conclusion: GDM is characterized by alterations in maternal circulating RBP4 concentrations akin to those of Type 2 diabetes mellitus. RBP4 concentrations in maternal plasma may play a role in accelerated fetal growth in the absence of overt carbohydrate intolerance.

AB  - Objective. Maternal circulating visfatin concentrations are higher in patients with a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate than in those who delivered an appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonate or in those with pre-eclampsia. It has been proposed that enhanced transfer of visfatin from the foetal to maternal circulation may account for the high concentrations of maternal visfatin observed in patients with an SGA neonate. The aims of this study were: (1) to determine whether cord blood visfatin concentrations differ between normal neonates, SGA neonates and newborns of pre-eclamptic mothers; and (2) to assess the relationship between maternal and foetal circulating visfatin concentrations in patients with an SGA neonate and those with pre-eclampsia. Study design. This cross-sectional study included 88 pregnant women and their neonates, as well as 22 preterm neonates in the following groups: (1) 44 normal pregnant women at term and their AGA neonates; (2) 22 normotensive pregnant women and their SGA neonates; (3) 22 women with pre-eclampsia and their neonates; and (4) 22 preterm neonates delivered following spontaneous preterm labour without funisitis or histologic chorioamnionitis, matched for gestational age with infants of pre-eclamptic mothers. Maternal plasma and cord blood visfatin concentrations were determined by ELISA. Nonparametric statistics were used for analyses. Results. (1) The median visfatin concentration was lower in umbilical cord blood than in maternal circulation, in normal pregnancy, SGA and pre-eclampsia groups (p<0.001 for all comparisons); (2) the median cord blood visfatin concentrations did not differ significantly between term AGA or SGA neonates, infants of mothers with pre-eclampsia and their gestational-age-matched preterm AGA neonates; (3) maternal and cord blood visfatin concentrations correlated only in the normal term group (r=0.48, p=0.04). Conclusion. Circulating visfatin concentrations are lower in the foetal than in the maternal circulation and did not significantly differ between the study groups. Thus, it is unlikely that the foetal circulation is the source of the high maternal visfatin concentrations reported in patients with an SGA neonate.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Women with preeclampsia and those who delivered a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate share several mechanisms of disease, including chronic uteroplacental ischemia and failure of physiologic transformation of the spiral arteries. However, the clinical manifestation of these obstetrical syndromes is remarkably different. It has been proposed that an altered maternal metabolic state, as well as a unique circulating cytokines milieu, predispose women to develop either preeclampsia or SGA. Compelling evidence suggests that adipose tissue orchestrates both metabolic pathways and immunological responses via the production of adipokines. Visfatin is a novel adipocytokine with metabolic and immunomodulating properties. The objective of this study was to determine whether preeclampsia and SGA are associated with alterations in maternal circulating visfatin concentrations., METHODS: This cross-sectional study included pregnant women in the following groups: (1) normal pregnancy (n = 158); (2) patients with preeclampsia (n = 43) of which 32 had an AGA and 11 had an SGA neonate; (3) patients without preeclampsia who delivered an SGA neonate (n = 55). Maternal plasma visfatin concentrations were measured by ELISA. Nonparametric tests and multiple linear regression analysis were used., RESULTS: (1) Women who delivered an SGA neonate had a higher median maternal plasma visfatin concentration than those with a normal pregnancy (20.0 ng/ml, interquartile range: 17.2-24.6 vs. 15.2 ng/ml, 12.1-19.2, respectively; P < 0.001) and than those with preeclampsia (14.5 ng/ml, 12.5-18.7; P < 0.001); (2) the median maternal plasma visfatin concentration did not differ significantly between patients with preeclampsia and those with a normal pregnancy (P = 0.8); (3) among patients with preeclampsia, there was no significant difference in the median maternal plasma visfatin concentration between those with or without an SGA neonate (P = 0.5); (4) in a linear regression model, delivery of an SGA neonate and pregestational body mass index were independently associated with increased visfatin concentration after adjustment for confounding factors (maternal age, smoking, gestational age at blood collection and the presence of preeclampsia or SGA)., CONCLUSION: (1) Patients with SGA, but not those with preeclampsia, had a higher maternal plasma visfatin concentration than those with a normal pregnancy; (2) this finding suggests differential involvement of visfatin in SGA and preeclampsia; (3) we propose that changes in circulating maternal visfatin concentration may be implicated in the phenotypic definitions and distinction of preeclampsia and SGA.

AB  - PROBLEM: Visfatin/pre-B-cell-enhancing factor (PBEF) has been implicated in the regulation of the innate immune system, as well as in glucose metabolism. Specifically, visfatin plays a requisite role in delayed neutrophil apoptosis in patients with sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine whether pyelonephritis during pregnancy is associated with changes in maternal plasma visfatin concentration in normal weight and overweight/obese patients., METHOD OF STUDY: This cross-sectional study included the following groups: (1) normal pregnant women (n = 200) and (2) pregnant women with pyelonephritis (n = 40). Maternal plasma visfatin concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics was used for analyses., RESULTS: (1) The median maternal plasma visfatin concentration was significantly higher in patients with pyelonephritis than in those with a normal pregnancy; (2) among overweight/obese pregnant women, those with pyelonephritis had a significantly higher median plasma visfatin concentration than women with a normal pregnancy; and (3) pyelonephritis was independently associated with higher maternal plasma visfatin concentrations after adjustment for maternal age, pre-gestational body mass index, smoking status, gestational age at sampling, and birthweight., CONCLUSION: Acute pyelonephritis during pregnancy is associated with a high circulating maternal visfatin concentration. These findings suggest that visfatin/PBEF may play a role in the regulation of the complex and dynamic crosstalk between inflammation and metabolism during pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Visfatin, a novel adipokine with metabolic and immunoregulatory properties, has been implicated in the regulation of fetal growth, as well as in preterm labor. A gap in knowledge is whether spontaneous labor at term is associated with changes in the maternal and fetal concentrations of visfatin. The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of labor at term is associated with alterations in maternal and neonatal plasma visfatin concentrations., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included 50 normal pregnant women at term and their appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) neonates in the following groups: 1) 25 mother-neonate pairs delivered by elective cesarean section without spontaneous labor, and 2) 25 mother-neonate pairs who delivered vaginally following spontaneous labor. Maternal plasma and cord blood visfatin concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics were used for analyses., RESULTS: 1) The median visfatin concentration was higher in umbilical cord plasma of neonates born following a spontaneous labor at term than that of those who were born by an elective cesarean section (P=0.02); 2) in contrast, the median maternal plasma visfatin concentration did not differ significantly between patients with and without labor (P=0.44); and 3) there was a significant correlation between umbilical cord plasma concentration of visfatin and both maternal visfatin concentration (r=0.54, P=0.005) and gestational age (GA) at delivery (r=0.58; P=0.002) only in the absence of labor., CONCLUSION: Term labor is associated with increased fetal, but not maternal, circulating visfatin concentrations. Previous reports indicate that preterm labor leading to preterm delivery is characterized by an increase in maternal plasma concentrations of visfatin. The observations reported herein support the view that there are fundamental differences in the endocrine and metabolic adaptations in normal labor at term and preterm labor.

AB  - Objective. Intra-amniotic and systemic infection/inflammation have been causally linked to preterm parturition and fetal injury. An emerging theme is that adipose tissue can orchestrate a metabolic response to insults, but also an inflammatory response via the production of adipocytokines, and that these two phenomenons are interrelated. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitising, anti-inflammatory adipocytokine, circulates in multimeric complexes including low-molecular weight (LMW) trimers, medium-molecular weight (MMW) hexamers and high-molecular weight (HMW) isoforms. Each of these complexes can exert differential biological effects. The aim of this study was to determine whether spontaneous preterm labor (PTL) with intact membranes and intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) is associated with changes in maternal serum circulating adiponectin multimers. Study design. This cross-sectional study included patients in the following groups: (1) normal pregnant women (n = 158); (2) patients with an episode of preterm labor and intact membranes without IAI who delivered at term (n = 41); (3) preterm labor without IAI who delivered preterm (n = 27); and (4) preterm labor with IAI who delivered preterm (n = 36). Serum adiponectin multimers (total, HMW, MMW and LMW) concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics were used for analyses. Results. (1) Preterm labor leading to preterm delivery or an episode of preterm labor that does not lead to preterm delivery was associated with a lower median maternal serum concentration of total and HMW adiponectin, a lower median HMW/total adiponectin ratio and a higher median LMW/total adiponectin ratio than normal pregnancy; (2) among patients with preterm labor, those with IAI had the lowest median concentration of total and HMW adiponectin, as well as the lowest median HMW/total adiponectin ratio; (3) the changes in maternal adiponectin and adiponectin multimers remained significant after adjusting for confounding factors such as maternal age, BMI, gestational age at sampling and parity. Conclusion. (1) Preterm labor is characterised by a change in the profile of adiponectin multimers concentrations and their relative isoforms. These changes were observed in patients with an episode of preterm labor not leading to preterm delivery, in patients with intra-amniotic inflammation, or in those without evidence of intra-amniotic inflammation. (2) The changes in adiponectin multimer concentrations reported in preterm labor are different from those previously reported in spontaneous labor at term, suggesting that there is a fundamental difference between preterm labor and labor at term. (3) The findings reported herein provide the first evidence for the participation of adiponectin multimer in preterm parturition. We propose that adiponectins and adipokines in general provide a mechanism to organise the metabolic demands generated by the process of preterm parturition regardless of the nature of the insult (intra-amniotic inflammation or not).

AB  - CONTEXT: Discordant twin gestation, in which one fetus is growth restricted, is a unique model that can elucidate the mechanism(s) by which the intrauterine environment affects fetal growth., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to determine the cord blood adiponectin and leptin concentrations and evaluate their association with birth weight in dichorionic twins, with and without growth discordance. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, AND MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: In this cross-sectional study, arterial cord blood adiponectin and leptin concentrations were determined in two groups of newborns: 1) discordant twins, in which one of the twins is growth restricted (small for gestation age and abnormal umbilical arteries Doppler) and the other is appropriate for gestation age (AGA) (n = 14 pairs); and 2) concordant twins, in which both twins are AGA (n = 15 pairs)., RESULTS: Results were: 1) within the discordant twins group, the median adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in the growth-restricted newborns than in their cotwins (P = 0.004); 2) within the concordant twin group, there was no significant difference in the median cord blood adiponectin concentration between the two AGA twins; 3) the median leptin concentration did not differ between the twins pairs in both study groups; 4) a positive correlation between cord blood adiponectin concentrations and both birth weight (r = 0.7, P < 0.001) and gestational age (r = 0.6, P < 0.02) was found only in the small-for-gestational-age newborns; 5) linear regression model revealed that birth weight is independently associated with circulating adiponectin concentration., CONCLUSIONS: Low circulating adiponectin concentrations, previously reported in adults, children, and infants who were born small for gestational age, characterize fetuses with growth restriction and are independently associated with birth weight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipose tissue dysfunction, characterized by dysregulation of adipokines production and/or secretion, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of type-2 diabetes mellitus, a metabolic complication closely related to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Recently, an association between circulating maternal visfatin, a novel adipokine with metabolic and immunoregulatory properties, and impaired glucose metabolism as well as with altered fetal growth, has been proposed. The aims of this study were to determine whether there is an association between maternal plasma visfatin concentration, GDM, and a large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborn., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study, included pregnant women at term in the following groups: 1) normal pregnancy and an appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) neonate (n=54); 2) normal pregnancy and an LGA newborn (n=47); 3) GDM and an AGA newborn (n=56); 4) GDM and an LGA newborn (n=45). The study population was further stratified by first trimester BMI (<25 vs. > or =25 kg/m(2)). Maternal plasma visfatin concentration was determined by ELISA. Parametric and non-parametric statistics were used for analysis., RESULTS: 1) Among women who delivered an AGA neonate, the median maternal plasma concentration of visfatin was higher in patients with GDM than in those with a normal pregnancy; 2) Among women with a normal pregnancy, those who delivered an LGA neonate had a higher median maternal plasma visfatin concentration than those who delivered an AGA neonate; 3) among patients with normal BMI, there were no significant differences in the median maternal plasma visfatin concentration between the four study groups; and 4) maternal GDM, as well as delivery of an LGA neonate were independently associated with a higher maternal plasma visfatin concentrations., CONCLUSION: The linkage between increased maternal circulating visfatin and the presence of GDM or delivery of an LGA neonate supports the hypothesis that perturbation of adipokines homeostasis may play a role in the pathophysiology of GDM or excess fetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Several mechanisms of disease have been implicated in the pathophysiology of small-for-gestational-age (SGA) including an anti-angiogenic state, and an exaggerated intravascular pro-inflammatory response. Adiponectin plays a role in a wide range of biological activities including those that have been implicated in the pathophysiology SGA. Thus, the aim of this study was to determine if third trimester adiponectin concentrations differed between women with normal weight infants and those with an SGA neonate., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included women with: 1) a normal pregnancy (n=234); and 2) an SGA neonate (n=78). SGA was defined as a birth weight below the 10th percentile for gestational age at birth. The study population was further stratified by first trimester body mass index (BMI) (normal weight <25 kg/m(2) vs. overweight/obese > or =25 kg/m(2)). Maternal serum adiponectin multimers [total, high-molecular-weight (HMW), medium-molecular-weight (MMW) and low-molecular-weight (LMW)] concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics were used for analyses., RESULTS: 1) The median maternal serum concentrations of total, HMW and MMW adiponectin were significantly lower in patients with an SGA neonate than in those with normal pregnancies; 2) patients with an SGA neonate had a significantly lower median HMW/total adiponectin ratio and higher median MMW/total adiponectin and LMW/total adiponectin ratios than those with a normal pregnancy; 3) among patients with an SGA neonate, neither maternal serum concentrations of adiponectin multimers, nor their relative distribution differ between normal weight and overweight/obese patients., CONCLUSION: 1) Pregnancies complicated by an SGA neonate are characterized by a alterations in the maternal serum adiponectin multimers concentrations and their relative abundance; 2) the findings reported herein suggest that maternal adipose tissue may play a role, in the pathogenesis of SGA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Visfatin, a novel adipokine with diabetogenic and immunoregulatory properties, has been implicated in the pathophysiology of insulin resistance, as well as in various acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. We have previously reported that amniotic fluid concentrations of visfatin are higher in patients with preterm labor (PTL) and intra-amniotic infection than in patients with PTL without infection. The aim of this study was to determine whether spontaneous PTL with intact membranes and intra-amniotic infection/inflammation (IAI) is associated with changes in maternal plasma circulating visfatin concentrations., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional study included patients in the following groups: (1) normal pregnant women (n = 123); (2) patients with an episode of PTL and intact membranes without IAI who delivered at term (n = 57); (3) PTL without IAI who delivered preterm (n = 47); and (4) PTL with IAI who delivered preterm (n = 57). Plasma visfatin concentrations were determined by ELISA. Non-parametric statistics were used for analysis., RESULTS: (1) PTL with IAI leading to preterm delivery was associated with a higher median maternal plasma concentration of visfatin than normal pregnancy; (2) among patients with PTL, those with IAI had the highest median maternal concentration of visfatin; (3) the changes in maternal plasma visfatin remained significant after adjusting for maternal age, body mass index, gestational age at sampling, and birth weight., CONCLUSION: (1) PTL with IAI is characterized by high maternal circulating visfatin concentrations; (2) these findings suggest that visfatin plays a role in the regulation of the metabolic adaptations to insults resulting in PTL in the context of IAI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether maternal, placental or fetal compartment contributes to the high levels of cord blood adiponectin., STUDY DESIGN: Serum adiponectin levels were compared from 62 newborns and their mothers as well as 32 newborns at delivery and 4 days postpartum. In addition, human placental tissues were tested for the presence of adiponectin mRNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: Cord blood serum adiponectin levels were significantly higher and did not correlate with maternal adiponectin levels (32.5 +/- 7.5 vs. 11.0 +/- 3.6 microg/mL, p < 0.001). Cord blood and day 4 serum adiponectin did not differ significantly (32.6 +/- 7.6 vs. 29.5 +/- 8.4 microg/mL, p < 0.3). In addition, adiponectin mRNA was not expressed in the placenta., CONCLUSION: These findings preclude the possibility of a placental or maternal origin of cord adiponectin. Thus, the high cord adiponectin levels may be attributed to fetal tissues.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to disclose the relationship between adiponectin and birth weight in a large group of newborns with normal and aberrant growth ("overweight")., STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-one healthy, term newborns were divided into 2 groups: 20 in the large-for-gestational age (LGA; 4297 +/- 207 g), and 61 newborns in the appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA; 3384 +/- 368 g). Cord blood was analyzed for adiponectin, leptin, and insulin levels., RESULTS: Mean adiponectin level was significantly lower in LGA newborns (29.4 +/- 13.8 vs 35.0 +/- 9.9 microg/mL, P < .04). Both leptin and insulin levels were higher in LGA than AGA newborns, and leptin levels positively correlated with birth weight in both groups. Insulin levels positively correlated with birth weight in AGA newborns., CONCLUSION: The results of this study imply that adiponectin may have a role in fetal growth and support the notion of negative feedback exerted by adipose tissue on adiponectin levels, as previously shown in adults.

AB  - Current literature provides contradictory information on the role of adiponectin (AdipoQ) in the course of gestational diabetes (GDM). The aim of the study was to measure AdipoQ concentration in blood of women with GDM and to find relationships between this adipokine and clinical and biochemical parameters. The study group included 50 women diagnosed with GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation who underwent routine prenatal tests for GDM in compliance with the guidelines of the Polish Diabetes Association. All patients underwent clinical and laboratory evaluation at GDM diagnosis. Laboratory tests included serum AdipoQ concentration, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, OGTT and lipid parameters in serum. AdipoQ concentrations did not differ significantly between the groups during gestation (p=0.7054). In the subgroup (2h glucose level in the OGTT 200 mg/dl) the concentration of AdipoQ tended to be decreased as compared to the remaining patients from the study and control groups, though the decline was insignificant (p=0.0541). The concentration of AdipoQ in the subgroup was about 20% lower than in the other patients from the study group. No correlations, except with the neonatal weight (r= - 0.29, p<0.05), were found between AdipoQ and the studied parameters. The GDM group showed significantly elevated fasting glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR values, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triglicerydes, as compared with the control group (p.05). These results lead to the conclusion that women with newly diagnosed and promptly treated GDM have normal adiponectin level. A negative correlation between AdipoQ level and the birth weight may suggest that this adipokine plays a role in the control of the birth weight especially in the incidence of macrosomia. 2013 © Curr.

AB  - AIM: To identify biochemical and genetic variation relating to increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease in young, lean male and female adults of different ethnicities., METHOD: Fasting blood and urine and non-fasting blood following oral glucose intake were analysed in 90 Caucasians, South Asians and South East/East Asians., RESULTS: There were no differences in age, birthweight, blood pressure, body mass index, percent body fat, total energy, percentage of macronutrient intake, microalbumin, leptin, cortisol, adrenocorticotropic hormone, nitric oxide metabolites, C-reactive protein, homocysteine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, von Willebrand factor, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, and tissue plasminogen activator. Fasting total cholesterol (P = .000), triglycerides (P = .050), low density lipoprotein (P = .009) and non-fasting blood glucose (15 min) (P = .024) were elevated in South Asians compared with Caucasians, but there was no significant difference in glucose area under curve (AUC). Non-fasting insulin in South Asians (15-120 min), in South East/East Asians (60-120 min), and insulin AUC in South Asians and South East/East Asians, were elevated compared with Caucasians (P<=0.006). The molar ratio of C-peptide AUC/Insulin AUC (P = .045) and adiponectin (P = .037) were lower in South Asians compared with Caucasians. A significant difference in allele frequency distributions in Caucasians and South Asians was found for rs2166706 (P = 0.022) and rs10830963 (P = 0.009), which are both near the melatonin receptor MTNR1B., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated non-fasting insulin exists in young South Asians of normal fasting glucose and insulin. Hepatic clearance of insulin may be reduced in South Asians. No current biochemical evidence exists of endothelial dysfunction at this stage of development. MTNR1B signalling may be a useful therapeutic target in Asian populations in the prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the distribution of circulating adiponectin isoforms in pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and compare isoform distribution changes 12 months after delivery., DESIGN CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY SETTING: University Hospital., POPULATION: Sixty-four consecutive pregnant women who underwent routine prenatal tests for GDM between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. The study group included 36 women diagnosed with GDM, 30 of whom underwent re-testing for diabetes 12 months after delivery. The control group included 28 healthy pregnant women., METHODS: Quantitative determination of total adiponectin and its isoforms in serum was performed with the multimeric adiponectin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: Total adiponectin concentration in women with GDM was significantly lower than in women without GDM. Among adiponectin isoforms, significantly lower concentrations of multimers and trimers in women with GDM were found in comparison to controls, while the concentration of hexamers did not differ between the groups. After delivery, a significant increase in total adiponectin and in the concentration of multimers and trimers was found in women with history of GDM. Additionally, we found that multimers and hexamers were negatively correlated with body mass index before and during gestation, as well as after delivery, and middle molecular weight isoforms in gestation were negatively correlated with birthweight., CONCLUSIONS: Hypoadiponectinemia during GDM was characterized by a significant, reversible decrease in multimeric levels; thus this isoform seems to function in a cohesive way with total adiponectin. Negative correlations of adiponectin isomers with body mass index indicate that there is a possibility to normalize total adiponectin and prevent GDM.

AB  - Protein malnutrition in utero that induces permanent changes in metabolism has been investigated intensively in various animals in recent years, but to the best of our knowledge, not yet in the mink, a strict carnivore. In the present study, minks were fed either a low-protein (LP) diet, i.e., with a protein: fat: carbohydrate ratio of 14:51:35% of metabolisable energy (ME), or an adequate-protein diet (AP), i.e. 29: 56: 15% of ME, from when implantation was completed until parturition (17.9 +/- 3.6 days). Respiration and balance experiments were performed during both gestation and lactation. Plasma concentrations of leptin, IGF-1, and insulin were determined by radioimmunoassay; the relative abundances of glucose-6-phosphatase (G-6-Pase), fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fru-1,6-P(2)ase), phosphoenol-pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), and pyruvate kinase (PKM2) were determined in liver, and abundances of adiponectin and leptin in adipose tissue were determined by real-time quantitative PCR (q PCR). The protein supply only affected quantitative metabolism traits during the period of differentiated feeding. The dietary composition was reflected in the nitrogen metabolism and substrate oxidation, but no effects remained during lactation. The LP dams tended to have a smaller liver mass in relation to body weight than did AP dams (2.5% vs. 2.9%; p = 0.09), significantly less leptin mRNA (p < 0.05), and 30.6% fewer kits per mated female (p = 0.03). Furthermore, F-1-generation kits exposed to protein restriction during foetal life (FLP1; 10.3 g) had a lower birth weight (p = 0.004) than did F-1-generation kits exposed to adequate protein (FAP1; 11.3 g). Differences remained significant until 21 days of age (120.4 g vs. 127.6 g; p = 0.005). The FLP1 foetuses displayed a lower abundance of Fru-1,6-P(2)ase mRNA (p = 0.007) and of PKM2 mRNA (p = 0.002) than did FAP1 foetuses. Whether these changes during foetal life cause permanent changes in the glucose homeostasis of the offspring and result in the transmission of epigenetic phenotypic changes, as seen in the rat, needs further investigation.

AB  - We investigated the dynamics of the leptin concentration throughout the perinatal period. Serum leptin concentrations in venous cord blood at different gestational ages were measured in 20 preterm and 139 term newborns, as well as in 143 pregnant women and 24 term newborns at approximately 6 d of life. Leptin concentrations in preterm newborns (mean 4.6+/-6.9 ng/mL) were lower than those in term newborns (mean 19.6+/-14.3 ng/mL) and tended to increase according to gestational age and birth weight, especially from the late stage of gestation. Leptin concentrations in pregnant women increased from the first trimester and then remained higher than those in non-pregnant women throughout the remainder of pregnancy even after controlling for body mass index. The leptin concentrations of newborns declined rapidly and were extremely low by approximately 6 d of life (mean 1.9+/-1.1 ng/mL). These results suggest that fetuses might produce a part of circulating leptin in their own adipocytes and that the relatively high leptin concentrations at birth and their rapid decline in the early neonatal period might reflect the dramatic changes of the hormonal and nutritional state during the perinatal period.

AB  - To investigate the effect of leptin on fetal growth, serum leptin concentrations in venous cord blood were measured in 82 newborns (male = 43, female = 39, gestational age 36-42 weeks, birth weight 2,306-4,128 g). Serum leptin concentrations in cord blood ranged from 2.0 to 84.5 ng/mL (mean 19.9 +/- 17.4 ng/mL). Serum leptin concentrations in males (mean 15.3 +/- 15.6 ng/mL, range 2.0 to 79.3 ng/mL) were significantly (P = 0.011) lower than those in females (mean 25.0 +/- 18.0 ng/mL, range 2.1 to 84.5 ng/mL). Serum leptin concentrations in cord blood were positively correlated with birth weight (r = 0.555, P <0.0001), birth weight SD (r = 0.540, P <0.0001), Kaup index (r = 0.505, P <0.0001) and body weight/body height (r = 0.560, P <0.0001). The serum concentrations of estradiol and testosterone did not differ between males and females and did not correlate with the leptin concentration. It is unlikely that the gender difference in fetal leptin levels is due either to body fat content or distribution or to reproductive hormone status, but may be attributed to genetic differences between males and females.

AB  - The links between obesity and metabolic syndrome in parents and their offspring and the role of genes and a shared environment are not completely understood. Adipocytokines play important roles in glucose and lipid metabolism. We have already developed the model mice for transgenerational effect of obesity and metabolic syndrome and demonstrated that exposure to a high fat diet in utero might cause a metabolic syndrome-like phenomenon through epigenetic modifications of adipocytokine, adiponectin and leptin gene expressions in offspring of the model mice. In this study, we examined whether poor circumstance in utero affected the adiponectin gene expression and epigenetic changes of this gene using samples from umbilical cord in patients with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy (HDP) and fetal growth restriction (FGR) or gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and heavy for date fetus (HFD) compared with normal pregnant women without HDP, GDM and abnormal fetal growth. We observed that the poor circumstance under HDP with HGR or GDM with HFD caused significantly lower adiponectin gene expression and higher methylation level of histone H3 at lysine 9 of the promoter of adiponectin gene compared with normal control. Thus, poor circumstance in utero affected adiponectin gene expressions through epigenetic modifications, which might result in the increased risk for metabolic syndrome of offspring.

AB  - Objective Circulating angiogenic factors have been shown to be important in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia. Blood levels of adipocytokines differ in pre-eclampsia relative to controls and may also play an important role in disease pathogenesis. Differences in the circulating levels of these molecules were compared between matched normotensive controls and women with pre-eclampsia with onset before or at/after 32 weeks, and according to whether the women were of normal weight (18.5 < body mass index < 25) or overweight. Design A cross-sectional study of 110 pregnant Japanese women who visited the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Okayama University Hospital, Okayama, Japan. Setting Tertiary referral centre serving 2000 births. Methods Serum concentrations of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1), placental growth factor (PlGF), soluble endoglin (sEng), adiponectin and leptin were measured in women with pre-eclampsia and in normotensive controls matched for age, gestational week, parity and body mass index. Main outcome measures Serum levels of sFlt-1, PlGF, the sFlt-1/PlGF ratio, sEng, adiponectin and leptin. Results The sFlt-1/PlGF ratio in early-onset pre-eclampsia was significantly higher than that in late-onset pre-eclampsia (112.0 +/- 30.2 versus 45.4 +/- 43.8, P = 0.037). There was a significant elevation of leptin in both subtypes relative to controls (early: 58.6 +/- 18.3 ng/ml versus 26.0 +/- 6.7 ng/ml, P = 0.001; late: 39.5 +/- 9.2 ng/ml versus 22.0 +/- 4.3 ng/ml, P = 0.005), but adiponectin was increased only in late-onset pre-eclampsia (36.5 +/- 13.4 mu g/ml versus 12.0 +/- 4.3 mu g/ml, P = 0.003). Significant differences in angiogenic factors and adiponectin were found between normal and overweight women only in late-onset pre-eclampsia. Conclusions These data suggest that there are different profiles of angiogenic factors and adipocytokines between women who develop early- and late-onset pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Context: Recent reports have demonstrated that soluble endoglin (sEng), an antiangiogenic protein thought to impair TGF-beta binding to receptors, and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (sVEGFR)-1 play important roles in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia ( PE). Moreover, insulin resistance, which is greatly influenced by adipocytokines, characterizes PE. Objectives: We examined possible links between sEng, VEGF, sVEGFR, and adipocytokines in the pathophysiology of PE. Study Design: We performed a cross-sectional study in 30 PE patients and controls matched for gestational age and body mass index. Blood samples were collected soon after disease onset. We measured serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, sEng, VEGF, placental growth factor (PlGF), and sVEGFR [soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (sFlt-1) and soluble fetal liver kinase 1 (sFlk-1)], and examined the placental protein content of sEng and sFlt-1. Results: sEng concentrations in PE patients (60.9 +/- 28.8 ng/ml) were significantly higher than those in controls (11.2 +/- 4.4 ng/ml). There was a significant correlation between sEng and sFlt-1 or PlGF. Moreover, there were significant differences in mean blood pressure between the high and low sEng groups, and in proteinuria between the high and low sFlt- 1 groups, and significant differences in placental sEng and sFlt- 1 contents between patients with and without severe hypertension or proteinuria. sEng was also correlated positively with adiponectin levels and negatively with the leptin to adiponectin ratio. Conclusions: Along with sFlt-1 and PlGF, sEng might play a role in the pathophysiology of PE, especially in elevating blood pressure, while the association with hypoadiponectinemia and the high leptin to adiponectin ratio in pregnancy seem to be risk factors for PE.

AB  - Higher maternal and biomarker levels of n-3 long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFAs) have been associated with improved perinatal outcomes and may also influence offspring metabolic health. Past studies were not powered to examine metabolic outcomes and few have specifically targeted metabolically vulnerable populations. We examined the associations of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA status with markers of metabolic health in early and mid-childhood in the full population as well as stratified by maternal glucose tolerance. Our data consisted of 1418 mother-child dyads from Project Viva, a longitudinal, prospective pre-birth cohort enrolled in eastern Massachusetts. We assessed maternal dietary intake of fish and n-3 LCPUFA in mid-pregnancy using a validated food frequency questionnaire. N-3 LCPUFA levels were quantified in maternal second trimester and umbilical cord plasma using liquid-gas chromatography. We assessed offspring anthropometry, adiposity, and blood pressure at early (median age: 3.2 years) and mid-childhood (median age: 7.7 years); and assayed blood samples collected at these visits for metabolic biomarkers. We report here multivariable effect estimates and 95% CI. Early childhood BMI z-score was on average 0.46 (1.03) units and waist circumference 51.3 (3.7) cm. At mid-childhood these measures were 0.39 (1.00) units and 60.0 (8.3) cm, respectively. Higher cord plasma DHA levels were associated with lower BMI z-score ((Q) uartile 4 vs. Q1: -0.21, 95% CI: -0.38, -0.03), waist circumference (Q4 vs. Q1: -0.63, 95% CI: -1.27, 0.00 cm), and leptin levels (Q4 vs. Q1: -0.36, 95% CI: -0.77, 0.05 ng/mL) in early childhood. These associations were strongest and reached significance in offspring of women with isolated hyperglycemia vs. better or worse glycemic status. Higher maternal DHA + EPA (Q4 vs. Q1: -1.59, 95% CI: -2.80, -0.38 mu g/mL) and fish (>= 3 vs. 0 portions/week: -2.18, 95% CI: -3.90, -0.47 mu g/mL) intake was related to lower adiponectin in early childhood. None of these associations persisted with mid-childhood outcomes. We did not find associations with any of the other outcomes. This study supports early and possibly transient effects of prenatal n-3 LCPUFA status on anthropometric measures and adipokine levels. It also raises the possibility that offspring of women with isolated hyperglycemia derive the most benefits from higher n-3 LCPUFA status.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of gestational age and fetal growth restriction on the cord blood adipokine profile, IGF1, and ghrelin levels, and their relationship with glucose metabolism., STUDY DESIGN: One hundred and ninety newborns (99 preterm and 91 full term) were studied and, according to their anthropometry at birth, classified as small (SGA) or adequate for gestational age (AGA)., METHODS: Venous cord blood serum levels of IGF1, IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3), adiponectin, resistin, leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), tumoral necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin 6 (IL-6), total ghrelin, and acylated ghrelin were determined and compared between preterm and full-term, as well as between SGA and AGA, newborns. Correlations with newborn weight, gestational age, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA) index, as an index of insulin resistance, were determined., RESULTS: Preterm newborns had higher HOMA, sOB-R, resistin, and IL-6 and lower IGF1, IGFBP-3, leptin, and adiponectin levels than full-term newborns. SGA had lower IGF1, IGFBP-3, leptin, IL-6, and adiponectin and higher sOB-R and total ghrelin than AGA newborns. Adiponectin and HOMA showed independent positive and negative correlations with gestational age respectively, but not with neonatal weight. Birth weight was correlated positively with IGF1 and leptin levels and negatively with total ghrelin ones., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that the lack of proper acquisition of adipose tissue by the fetus either due to prematurity or to fetal growth restriction is associated with changes in the cord blood adipokine profile that may contribute to the impairment of glucose metabolism.

AB  - In the past decade, epidemiological findings and data from experimental studies in animals have shown that the structure and function of the organism can be programmed during critical periods of development which can lead to detrimental long-term consequences for the health of an individual. Low birth weight has been linked to many adult diseases in humans including type 2 diabetes. The full detrimental effects of early growth restriction are often accompanied by the presence of obesity, which itself might be a manifestation of programmed appetite regulation in fetal and neonatal life. The understanding of interactions between leptin and insulin and their roles in glucose and body weight regulation provides clues towards mechanisms underlying altered appetite regulation and increased risk of type 2 diabetes in low birth weight individuals. Molecular mechanisms involved might include epigenetic alteration of the fetal genome in response to maternal nutrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birthweight has been associated with an increased risk of obesity, insulin resistance, and diabetes in adulthood. The aim of this study was to evaluate IGF-I, adiponectin, insulin levels, and body fat in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants at birth., METHODS: We performed a transverse comparative study in SGA and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants. The study was conducted at the Hospital of Gynecology and Obstetrics in Leon, Mexico. Weight, length, and percent of body fat were evaluated during the first 48 h of birth. Glucose, insulin, leptin, adiponectin, and IGF-I levels in cord blood were measured., RESULTS: We studied 100 infants (50 SGA and 50 AGA). A history of diabetes in a second-degree relative was higher in SGA infants than in AGA infants (48.0 vs. 30.0%, respectively; p = 0.03). Glucose, adiponectin, insulin and IGF-I levels were similar between the groups. Leptin levels and percentage of body fat were lower in SGA than AGA (15.3 vs. 23.4 ng/mL; p = 0.003, 11.1 vs. 12.7%; p <0.001, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that length, percentage of body fat, and leptin levels were positively associated with birthweight. However, leptin levels were not independent of percentage of body fat., CONCLUSIONS: Low body fat and leptin levels, but no evidence of increased metabolic risk at birth, were found in SGA infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Small for gestational age (SGA) has been associated with decreased insulin sensitivity (IS). A possible mechanism is the postnatal development of a metabolically disadvantageous body composition (BC)., AIM: To determine whether there are differences between IS and BC in girls in early puberty who were SGA (birth weight < 10th percentile) or appropriate for gestational age (AGA, 10th-90th percentile)., METHODS: Age-matched (SGA/AGA) early pubertal girls (Tanner II) were recruited from local schools. We determined waist circumference (WC), the sum of four skinfolds (S4S), and per cent fat mass (fat %) by impedanciometry. Leptin and OGTT assays were performed. The insulinogenic index (I-In), HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) and WBISI (whole body insulin sensitivity) were calculated., RESULTS: Median age (interquartile range) for 30 SGA and 35 AGA girls was 10.2 (1.1) vs. 9.8 (0.9), respectively (P = NS). BMI percentiles were 62.6 (56) vs. 67.4 (39); WC 60.5 (9.5) vs. 62.2 (6.5) cm; S4S 52 (30) vs. 52.2 (29.5) cm, and fat %[26.2 (6.7) vs. 28.5 (6.3)] was similar in both groups. SGA girls had higher leptin levels [15.4 (9.7) vs. 9.6 (11) ng/ml; P = 0.01] and I-In [2.05 (1.86) vs. 1.47 (1.27) microU/ml* mg/dl; P = 0.02]. No differences between HOMA-IR [2.07 (1.26) vs. 2.04 (1.4)] and WBISI [5.3 (3.3) vs. 5.1 (3.1)] were found between groups., CONCLUSION: The higher leptin level and I-In in girls born SGA at the beginning of puberty may be early indicators of an underlying subtle degree of insulin resistance, despite similar BMI and BC to AGA girls.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), is one of the most important pregnancy complications affecting approximately 15% of pregnant women. It is related to several gestational adverse outcomes in the fetus, e.g., macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, stillbirth, neonatal hypoglycemia, and respiratory distress. Women with GDM have a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes in the future. The pathogenesis of GDM is not completely understood; nevertheless, two factors could contribute to its development: beta-cell dysfunction and failure in insulin secretion in response to insulin resistance induced by gestation. Both processes, together with the physiological activities of the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), play a crucial role in glucose transport to the fetus and hence, fetal growth and development. IGFs (both IGF-1 and IGF-2) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs) regulate glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Maternal nutritional status determines the health of the newborn, as it has substantial effects on fetal growth and development. Maternal obesity and an energy-dense diet can cause an increase in insulin and IGF-1 serum levels, producing metabolic disorders, such as insulin resistance, GDM, and high birth weight (> 4,000 g) due to a higher level of body fat. In this way, in GDM pregnancies there is an increase in IGF-1 and IGF-2 serum levels, and a decrease in IGFBP-1 and 4 serum levels, suggesting the crucial role of the insulin/IGF system in this gestational outcome. Here, the present review tries to elucidate the role that energy-dense diets and the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway perform in GDM pregnancies.Copyright © 2022 Martin-Estal and Castorena-Torres.

AB  - Background: The mechanisms by which fetal weight are regulated during pregnancy are poorly understood. The relation between hormones such as leptin and adiponectin and intrautrine growth is still under investigation. The aim of this study was to ascertain whether fetal growth restriction is associated with alterations of leptin and adiponectin concentrations in venous umbilical cord blood and maternal serum. Method(s): Maternal serum and venous umbilical cord blood leptin and adiponectin concentrations were determined by ELISA after 36 week of gestational age in 22 women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies with AGA fetuses (group A) and in 22 women with singleton pregnancies complicated by fetal growth restriction but without fetal distress (group B), all with normal body mass index and without history of diabetes, hypertention or maternal cardiac disease. Result(s): Venous umbilical cord leptin levels were significantly lower in group B compared with group A (8.1+/-0.8ng/ml versus 39.45+/-6.8ng/ml; p=0.001). Venous umbilical cord adiponectin levels were also significantly lower in group B compared with group A (28.8+/-3.5mug/ ml versus 43.6+/-3.7mug/ml; p=0.007). Maternal serum leptin and adiponectin did not differ between SGA and AGA groups.maternal BMI, gestational age and maternal age did not differ between these two groups. Neither leptin nor adiponectin correlated with gender difference. Conclusion(s): In this study we confirmed that growth restricted fetuses show venous umbilical cord blood leptin and adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower than those in normal fetuses indicating that these two adipokines have an independent role in growth restriction pathogenesis. Maybe in future we can administer recombinant human leptin and adiponectin to growth restricted fetuses for treatment.

AB  - Background: Oxidative stress is involved in several neonatal conditions characterized by an upregulation in the production of oxidative or nitrative free radicals and a concomitant decrease in the availability of antioxidant species. Oxygen, which is obviously vital to survival, can be highly damaging to neonatal tissue which is known to be poorly equipped to neutralize toxic derivatives. Thus, exposure of the newborn infant to high oxygen concentrations during resuscitation at birth increases oxidative damage. Visfatin is an adipocytokine involved in oxidative stress and an important mediator of inflammation that induces dose-dependent production of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines. To our knowledge, the diagnostic value of visfatin as a marker of oxidative stress in preterm newborns has not been investigated. Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate visfatin levels in preterm neonates resuscitated with different concentrations of oxygen in the delivery room. Patients: Fifty-two preterm newborns with gestational age less than 32 weeks, resuscitated randomly with different oxygen concentrations (40%, 60%, or 100%) were enrolled at the University Hospital of Messina, over a 12-month period to evaluate serum visfatin levels at T0 (within 1 h after birth), T24 h, T72 h, and T168 h of life. Results: At T72 h and T168 h, higher serum visfatin values in the high-oxygen group compared to the low-and mildoxygen subjects (P = 0.002 and P < 0.001, respectively) were noted. Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that visfatin could be a new marker of oxidative stress in preterm newborns.

Although incidence of ALL has been steadily increasing in recent decades, no clear reason for this trend has been identified. Rising concurrently with ALL incidence, increasing maternal obesity rates may be partially contributing to increasing ALL prevelance. Epidemiological studies, including a recent meta-analysis, have found an association between maternal obesity and leukemogenesis in offspring, although mechanisms underlying this association remain unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this review is to propose possible mechanisms connecting maternal obesity to ALL risk in offspring, including changes to fetal/neonatal epigenetics, altered insulin-like growth factor profiles and insulin resistance, modified adipokine production and secretion, changes to immune cell populations, and impacts on birthweight and childhood obesity/adiposity. We describe how each proposed mechanism is biologically plausible due to their connection with maternal obesity, presence in neonatal and/or fetal tissue, observation in pediatric ALL patients at diagnosis, and association with leukemogenesis, A description of ALL and maternal obesity trends, a summary of epidemiological evidence, a discussion of the pathway from intrauterine environment to subsequent malignancy, and propositions for future directions are also presented.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the interrelationship between leptin,adiponectin and resistin in the fetal and early postnatal period and the association of these hormones with anthropometric and metabolic indexes. Serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin and resistin were measured in maternal and neonatal circulation at delivery and on the 3rd day after birth in 40 healthy newborns and their mothers Serum leptin levels were significantly higher in fetuses that in newborn infants on 3rd day after delivery, whereas concentration of adiponectin and resistin were maintained in either maternal and neonatal circulation after delivery. Leptin serum concentrations correlated with those of adiponectin in the fetal circulation, but not in neonatal life. On the other hand no correlation was found between leptin and resistin levels in cord blood, whereas a positive correlation between leptin and resistin concentrations was present in the neonatal circulation on 3rd day. Fetal leptin, adiponectin and resistin levels are largely independent of maternal influences and immediately after birth, important changes in the relation among adipokines occurred compared to intrauterine life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to determine the effects of in vivo administration of prenatal betamethasone on leptin and adiponectin concentration in maternal and fetal circulation., STUDY DESIGN: Blood samples were collected from 35 pregnant women receiving betamethasone for threatened preterm delivery before and at different time points after drug administration. Cord blood was collected at delivery in infants born from mothers treated with betamethasone and in 15 infants who delivered at the same gestational age not receiving betamethasone., RESULTS: Betamethasone caused an approximately 170% increase in maternal leptin at 24 hours after betamethasone, whereas it had no effects on adiponectin concentration. Betamethasone affects neonatal leptin and adiponectin levels in a time-dependent manner. The glucocorticoid-induced changes in the relationship between these adipokines in maternal and fetal circulation was long lasting., CONCLUSION: These results provide the first evidence for in vivo effects of glucocorticoids on maternal and fetal adipokines relationship in human pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hormone leptin, produced in the adipose tissue, is involved in the regulation of body weight. The release of the hormone is increased in obese adults and decreased after fasting in human adults. This study investigated whether the plasma leptin level was related to the infant's birth weight and whether the level was reduced in connection with the physiological weight loss during the neonatal period., METHODS: We measured the plasma leptin level in cord blood from infants who were large for gestational age (LGA) (n = 15), small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 16), and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (n = 38). AGA infants (n = 120), who were exclusively breastfed, were also studied during their first 4 postnatal days in a cross-sectional method. One blood sample was collected before breastfeeding from each infant. Plasma leptin concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: The median (range) concentration of leptin from cord blood was increased in LGA infants and decreased in SGA infants compared with the level in AGA infants. There was a positive correlation between the log of the plasma leptin level in cord blood and both the infant's birth weight (r = 0.76; n = 69) and the body mass index (r = 0.63; n = 69). The normal 3% to 6% weight reduction that occurs during the first 4 postnatal days was associated with a 26% decrease in the plasma leptin level in healthy breastfed infants., CONCLUSIONS: The plasma leptin level is highly correlated to the size of adipose tissue mass and decreases in connection with the initial physiological weight loss in newborn infants. These data provide evidence that leptin is highly related to the nutritional status already during the fetal and neonatal periods.

AB  - The study illustrate the inner correlation between global DNA methylation variation and different birth weights. Infant birth weight was used to identify cases and controls. Cord blood and placentas were collected. We performed DNA methylation profiling of bisulphite-converted DNA. We have identified many differentially methylated CpG sites in experimental groups; these sites involved in hundreds of signalings. Among these, more than ten pathways were referred to the glucose and lipid metabolism. Methylation changes in the insulin-signaling pathway (ISP), adipocytokine signaling pathway (ASP) and MAPK signaling pathway are involved in the fetal programming of diabetes..

AB  - Perturbations in the levels of serotonin expression have a significant impact on behavior and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neuropsychiatric disorders including anxiety, mood and appetite. Fetal programming is a risk factor for the development of metabolic diseases during adulthood. Moreover, previous studies have shown that serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and leptin are important in energy balance. In the present study, the impact of maternal malnutrition-induced prenatal undernutrition (UN) was investigated in mice and the expression of 5-HT1A, dopamine (D)1, D2 and Ob-Rb receptors was analyzed in the hypothalamus during adulthood. The UN group showed a low birth weight compared with the control group. With regard to receptor expression, 5-HT1A in the UN group was increased in the hypothalamus and D1 was reduced, whereas D2 showed an increase from postnatal day (P)14 in the arcuate nucleus. Ob-Rb receptor expression was increased in the hypothalamus at P14 and P90. These observations indicated that maternal caloric restriction programs a postnatal body weight gain in offspring with an increased food intake in early postnatal life which continues into adulthood. In addition, UN in mice was found to be affected by Ob-Rb, 5-HT1A and D1/2 receptor expression, indicating that these observations may be associated with hyperphagia and obesity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of total energy intake, macronutrient intake, and maternal adherence to Mediterranean diet or Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) on cord blood leptin and adiponectin levels, which have been associated with childhood adiposity., METHODS: We used multivariable linear regression to assess associations of maternal diet, averaged over 1st and 2nd trimesters, with cord blood adipokines of 780 women from the prospective cohort study Project Viva., RESULTS: Mean (SD) energy intake during pregnancy was 2135 (596) kcal. Mean (SD) cord blood levels of leptin and adiponectin were 9.0 (6.6) ng/ml and 28.6 (6.7) mug/ml, respectively. Neither closer adherence to a Mediterranean/AHEI pattern diet nor energy intake was associated with either cord blood leptin or adiponectin. Protein intake was associated with both marginally lower leptin (-0.22 ng/ml [95% CI -0.41, -0.02] for each 1% of energy) and adiponectin (-0.25 mug/ml [95% CI -0.48, -0.02])., CONCLUSIONS: Closer adherence to a Mediterranean/AHEI pattern diet during pregnancy was not associated with cord blood leptin or adiponectin. Maternal protein intake was weakly but significantly associated with lower cord blood leptin and adiponectin. Copyright © 2010 Elsevier Ltd and European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Leptin and adiponectin are adipocyte-secreted hormones that regulate energy homeostasis and metabolism. Because their roles in the neonatal period and in early childhood are poorly understood, we aimed in this prospective cohort study to determine the extent to which umbilical cord blood leptin and adiponectin concentrations predict measures of adiposity and growth at 3 years of age., PATIENTS AND METHODS: We studied 588 children participating in the prospective prebirth cohort study Project Viva. We examined associations of cord blood leptin and adiponectin levels with weight changes during the first 6 months of life, 3-year circulating leptin and adiponectin concentrations, and the following adiposity-related outcomes at 3 years of age: BMI z score, height-for-age z score, and sums of triceps and subscapular skinfold thicknesses to represent overall adiposity, as well as subscapular/triceps skinfold ratio to represent central adiposity., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin and adiponectin were each directly associated with the duration of gestation and birth weight for gestational age z scores. Cord blood leptin levels were negatively associated with change in weight-for-length, weight-for-age, and length-for-age z scores between birth and 6 months of age. Similarly, cord blood adiponectin was negatively associated with change in weight-for-length and weight-for-age z scores. After adjusting for several maternal and child factors related to obesity, each 10 ng/mL increment of cord blood leptin was associated with a reduction in BMI z score and higher leptin levels at 3 years but not with skinfold thicknesses. Each 10 microg/mL increment of cord blood adiponectin was positively associated with a higher subscapular skinfold thickness/triceps skinfold thickness ratio at 3 years., CONCLUSIONS: Lower cord blood leptin levels are associated with smaller size at birth but more pronounced weight gain in the first 6 months of life and higher BMI at 3 years of age. Cord blood adiponectin levels are also directly associated with birth weight for gestational age, inversely associated with weight gain in the first 6 months of life, and predict an increase in central adiposity at age 3 years.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess serum adiponectin levels of neonates in relation to ponderal index and birth length with and without adjustment for potential confounding factors including maternal factors and perinatal characteristics., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study., METHODS: Three hundred and three newborns (Caucasian, singleton, full term, with a birth weight of > or =2500 g, and apparently healthy) were included in the study. Blood samples were collected from the newborns no later than the fifth day of life for measurements of adiponectin and major IGF system components (IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3)). The data were analyzed using simple and multiple regression analyses., RESULTS: Adiponectin is substantially higher in neonates than in adults, with no evidence of the gender dimorphism observed among adults. We found an inverse association between neonatal adiponectin levels and newborn ponderal index and a positive association with newborn length by univariate analysis. We also found a statistically significant inverse association of adiponectin with jaundice/bilirubin, and a marginally significant positive association of this hormone with IGFBP-3 but no significant association with any maternal factors. In multivariate analysis, the inverse association between serum adiponectin and ponderal index does not remain significant after adjustment for potential confounding factors. In contrast, neonatal adiponectin levels correlate inversely significantly and independently with liver maturity and IGF-II and tend to remain positively associated with IGFBP-3 and increased birth length., CONCLUSIONS: An inverse association of adiponectin with ponderal index by univariate analysis is not independent from confounding factors. In contrast, the positive association between serum adiponectin and birth length may reflect either a direct effect of adiponectin or an adiponectin-mediated increase in the sensitivity of tissues to insulin and components of the IGF system, and needs to be explored further.

AB  - Prematurity, maternal smoking, and low birth weight each result in neuroendocrine dysfunction and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. Leptin, an adipocyte-secreted protein, has provided the first physiological link to the regulatory system controlling starvation-induced neuroendocrine changes in rodents. This study investigated whether leptin concentrations were detectable in cord blood of newborns, and assessed the effect of birth weight, prematurity, and maternal smoking on cord blood leptin concentrations. Fifty consecutively enrolled full-term and 12 preterm newborns born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy were compared to 50 full-term and 12 preterm newborns born to parents who were nonsmokers. RIA for leptin was performed using cord blood samples collected immediately after birth. Leptin concentrations were detectable in newborns and correlated positively with obesity (full-term, r = 0.30, P < 0.01; preterm, r = 0.47, P < 0.05). Maternal smoking during pregnancy was associated with decreased leptin concentrations in the cord blood of both full-term and preterm newborns. This effect was independent of obesity (full-term newborns: 5.25 +/- 2.48 vs. 4.21 +/- 2.71 ng/ml, P = 0.01) and was more pronounced in premature newborns (5.67 +/- 3.6 vs. 2.46 +/- 2.03, P = 0.02), and its magnitude in full-term newborns was directly related to the reported number of cigarettes the mothers of the full-term newborns smoked per day (r = -0.438, P < 0.001). Thus, low birth weight and maternal smoking are both associated with decreased leptin concentrations, and these effects are more pronounced in premature newborns. Future studies will be needed to determine whether administration of leptin might reverse the neuroendocrine dysfunction caused by maternal smoking.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin regulates satiety and energy homoeostasis, and plays a key role in placentation in pregnancy. Previous studies have demonstrated regulation of leptin gene (LEP) expression and/or methylation in placenta and cord blood in association with early life exposures, but most have been small and have not considered the influence of genetic variation. Here, we investigated the relationship between maternal factors in pregnancy, infant anthropometry and LEP genetic variation with LEP promoter methylation at birth and 12 months of age., METHODS: LEP methylation was measured in cord (n = 877) and 12-month (n = 734) blood in the Barwon Infant Study, a population-based pre-birth cohort. Infant adiposity at birth and 12-months was measured as triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness. Cross-sectional regression tested associations of methylation with pregnancy and anthropometry measures, while longitudinal regression tested if birth anthropometry predicted 12-month LEP methylation levels., RESULTS: Male infants had lower LEP methylation in cord blood (-2.07% average methylation, 95% CI (-2.92, -1.22), p < 0.001). Genetic variation strongly influenced DNA methylation at a single CpG site, which was also negatively associated with birth weight (r = -0.10, p = 0.003). Pre-eclampsia was associated with lower cord blood methylation at another CpG site (-6.06%, 95% CI (-10.70, -1.42), p = 0.01). Gestational diabetes was more modestly associated with methylation at two other CpG units. Adiposity at birth was associated with 12-month LEP methylation, modified by rs41457646 genotype. There was no association of LEP methylation with 12-month anthropometric measures., CONCLUSIONS: Infant sex, weight, genetic variation, and exposure to pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes, are associated with LEP methylation in cord blood. Infant adiposity at birth predicts 12-month blood LEP methylation in a genotype-dependent manner. These findings are consistent with genetics and anthropometry driving altered LEP epigenetic profile and expression in infancy. Further work is required to confirm this and to determine the long-term impact of altered LEP methylation on health.

AB  - Increasing evidence links epigenetic variation to anthropometric and metabolic measures. Leptin signalling regulates appetite and energy expenditure, and in pregnancy is important for nutrient supply to the foetus. Maternal metabolic health and foetal growth are linked to infant blood leptin gene (LEP) methylation, which has been cross-sectionally associated with adolescent obesity. Despite this, few studies have explored the relationship between infant LEP methylation and childhood anthropometry, or the impact of genetic variation on these relationships. Using a prospective birth cohort, we investigated whether blood LEP promoter methylation at birth and 12 months predicts weight and adiposity at 4-years. Locus-specific methylation data was analysed by partial correlation tests and multivariable linear regression. There was weak evidence of an association of birth LEP methylation with anthropometry measures at 4 years. Methylation at a specific site (cg19594666) at 12 months was inversely associated with 4-year weight (r = -0.11, p = 0.02) and body-mass index (BMI) (r = -0.13, p = 0.007), which persisted following adjustment for weight at birth and at 12 months. Neither association was influenced by genotype. We report the first evidence of an association between LEP methylation in infancy and childhood weight. Replication in additional cohorts is required to determine if this relationship persists.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the cord blood levels of adipokine and to assess their association with the fetal insulin resistance and fetal outcomes in newborns of gestational diabetic women (GDM). Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed in 40 GDM women and 40 healthy pregnant women (HPW) in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JIPMER) hospital in Puducherry, India, during the period from May 2016 to December 2017. Cord blood samples were collected at delivery from GDM and HPW groups. Cord plasma biochemical parameters such as insulin, C-peptide, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, and visfatin concentrations were measured. Leptin/adiponectin ratio (L/A), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA2-IR), insulin sensitivity (HOMA2-%S) and beta cell function (HOMA2-%B) were calculated. The pregnancy outcomes such as birth weight (BW), Ponderal index and Apgar scores of the baby were measured. Results: The BW and Ponderal index of the baby were found to be significantly higher in GDM newborns compared to HPW newborns. Cord plasma insulin, C-peptide, HOMA2 -IR, visfatin, leptin, and L/A ratio were significantly higher whereas adiponectin level was lower in GDM compared to HPW. A significant positive correlation was observed between L/A ratio and fetal HOMA2-IR. Conclusion : Altered adipokine levels with increased L/A ratio was observed among the new-borns of Indian gestational diabetic mothers. There was an association between increased L/A ratio, insulin resistance and increased Ponderal index among the new-borns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationships between maternal and cord leptin concentrations, maternal and neonatal outcomes, and measures of glycemic control in diabetic and nondiabetic pregnancy., STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective study of 60 type 1 diabetic and 50 nondiabetic pregnancies in a university teaching hospital. Serum leptin and hemoglobin A(1c) were measured serially throughout pregnancy; leptin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1, and C-peptide in venous cord blood were measured at delivery. Leptin was measured with the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Data were analyzed with specific computer software., RESULTS: Maternal leptin levels correlated with cord leptin levels in the nondiabetic group only. Cord leptin levels correlated with cord C-peptide, cord insulin-like growth factor-1, birth weight, birth weight corrected for gestational age, and neonatal anthropometry in both groups and with hemoglobin A(1c) in the diabetic group only. Cord leptin levels increased significantly with increasing birth weight corrected for gestational age but remained significantly higher at all birth weights in the diabetic group., CONCLUSION: There are strong associations between cord leptin levels and other measures of fetal growth in both groups and with glycemic control in the diabetic group.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Resistin and adiponectin are two adipokines involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity, and have been suggested as mediators of adult metabolic syndrome., AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate cord blood levels of resistin, and their postnatal changes in full-term appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates. Interrelations between resistin, adiponectin, and insulin, and between resistin and neonatal and maternal anthropometric parameters were also assessed., DESIGN: Blood samples were obtained from 30 full term AGA neonates at birth and on the 4th day of life. Anthropometric variables studied included birth weight, length, body mass index (BMI), neonatal weight loss, and mother's BMI. Resistin and adiponectin were determined by ELISA, and insulin by radioimmunoassay method. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon test and Spearman's correlation coefficient., RESULTS: Resistin levels were high at birth and did not change on the 4th day of life. Resistin levels were not correlated to insulin, nor adiponectin levels, nor any anthropometric parameter of neonates or their mothers. Instead, adiponectin levels increased on the 4th day of life, and were correlated to insulin levels., CONCLUSION: High levels of resistin in full-term AGA neonates suggest that this hormone may play a role in maintenance of metabolic neonatal homeostasis, but its physiological significance needs further investigation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess metabolic parameters in the cord blood of newborns of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and to correlate these parameters with those of mothers with PCOS during midgestation., DESIGN: Case-control study., SETTING: Unit of Endocrinology and Reproductive Medicine., PATIENT(S): Thirty newborns of mothers with PCOS (PCOSn) and 34 newborns of control mothers (Cn) were studied., INTERVENTION(S): A sample of cord blood was obtained at delivery. In all mothers, an oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) with measurement of glucose and insulin was performed at 22-28 weeks of gestation. In cord blood and in the fasting sample of the oGTT, serum leptin, adiponectin, insulin, glucose, and lipids (triglycerides, cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol) were determined., RESULT(S): PCOSn showed significantly higher leptin concentrations than Cn. Moreover, in PCOSn, leptin concentrations in cord blood were correlated with birth weight (r = 0.495) and body mass index of the mother at midpregnancy (r = 0.644)., CONCLUSION(S): The metabolic parameters in the cord blood of PCOSn are similar to those observed in controls, except for leptin concentrations, which are significantly higher. The latter could be related to the fetal adiposity or the metabolic condition of the mother.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: C-reactive protein (CRP) is a marker of systemic inflammation. Recently, it has been shown that CRP is present in amniotic fluid and fetal urine, and that elevated levels are associated with adverse pregnancy outcome. However, the precise source of amniotic fluid CRP, its regulation, and function during pregnancy is still a matter of debate. The present in vivo and in vitro studies were designed to investigate the production of CRP in human placental tissues., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten paired blood samples from peripheral maternal vein (MV), umbilical cord artery (UA) and umbilical vein (UV) were collected from women with elective caesarean sections at term. The placental protein accumulation capacity of hCG, hPL, leptin and CRP was compared with the dual in vitro perfusion method of an isolated cotyledon of human term placentae and quantified by ELISA. Values for accumulation (release) were calculated as total accumulation of maternal and fetal circuits normalized for tissue weight and duration of perfusion. For gene expression, RNA was extracted from placental tissue and reverse transcribed. RT-PCR and real-time PCR were performed using specific primers., RESULTS: The median (range) CRP level was significantly different between UA and UV [50.1 ng/ml (12.1-684.6) vs. 61 ng/ml (16.9-708.1)]. The median (range) difference between UV and UA was 9.3 ng/ml (2.2-31.6). A significant correlation was found between MV CRP and both UA and UV CRP levels. Median (range) MV CRP levels [2649 ng/ml (260.1-8299)] were 61.2 (6.5-96.8) fold higher than in the fetus. In vitro, the total accumulation rates (mean+/-SD) were 31+/-13 (mU/g/min, hCG), 1.16+/-0.19 (microg/g/min, hPL), 4.71+/-1.91 (ng/g/min, CRP), and 259+/-118 (pg/g/min, leptin). mRNA for hCG, hPL and leptin was detectable using conventional RT-PCR, while CRP mRNA could only be demonstrated by applying real-time RT-PCR. In the perfused tissue the transcript levels for the four proteins were comparable to those detected in the native control tissue., CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that the human placenta produces and releases CRP mainly into the maternal circulation similarly to other analyzed placental proteins under in vitro conditions. Further studies are needed to explore the exact role of placental CRP during pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate possible alterations in circulating levels of the adipocytokine visfatin in intrauterine growth-restricted and normal pregnancies, given that these groups differ considerably in fetal nutrition, body fat mass, and metabolic/endocrine mechanisms., METHODS: Serum visfatin levels were prospectively measured by enzyme immunoassay in 40 mothers and their 40 singleton term fetuses and neonates on postnatal days 1 and 4. Twenty neonates had intrauterine growth restriction (birth weight < or = 3rd customized centile, adjusted for parameters that influence growth potential), and 20 were appropriate for gestational age., RESULTS: Circulating maternal visfatin levels were significantly elevated in pregnancies with intrauterine growth restriction compared with control pregnancies with appropriate-for-gestational-age infants and negatively correlated with customized centiles in the group with intrauterine growth restriction. Postnatal day-1 and -4 visfatin levels were significantly higher in neonates with intrauterine growth restriction compared with neonates who were appropriate for gestational age. Postnatal-day-1 prefeeding insulin levels were significantly lower in neonates with intrauterine growth restriction., CONCLUSIONS: Pathologic conditions in pregnancy that lead to intrauterine growth restriction could be responsible for elevated maternal visfatin levels. Higher visfatin levels in neonates with intrauterine growth restriction may serve as an early marker with prognostic value for later development of insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes, whereas lower insulin levels may indicate reduced beta-cell mass and/or impaired beta-cell function.

AB  - AIM: To prospectively investigate circulating concentrations of the adipokine and angiogenic factor apelin in mother/infant pairs and correlate them with respective insulin concentrations., METHODS: Plasma apelin concentrations were determined in 40 mothers and their singleton full-term foetuses and neonates on day 1 (N1) and 4 (N4) of life., RESULTS: Maternal apelin concentrations were lower compared to foetal, N1 and N4 ones (p<0.001 in all cases). N1 apelin concentrations were lower compared to foetal and N4 ones (p=0.002 and p=0.005, respectively). Maternal apelin concentrations positively correlated with foetal, N1 and N4 concentrations (r=0.663, p<0.001, r=0.486, p=0.003, r=0.484, p=0.003, respectively). Foetal apelin concentrations positively correlated with N1 and N4 ones (r=0.337, p=0.044 and r=0.574, p<0.001, respectively). N1 apelin concentrations positively correlated with N4 ones (r=0.513, p=0.001). No association was found between apelin concentrations and birthweight, gender, parity or mode of delivery. No significant correlations were observed between apelin and insulin concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of apelin are high in the foetus, possibly suggesting its potential role in intrauterine development. Apelin expression in placental tissue could account for its higher foetal concentrations and for its down-regulation soon after birth. The postnatal increase of apelin concentrations could presumably point to a gradual initiation of ex utero angiogenesis.

AB  - Background: Understanding of maternal and fetal factors affecting leptin, adiponectin, and adiponectin:leptin ratio at birth may provide valuable insights into potential future risk of metabolic alterations and inform primordial prevention and precision nutrition strategies. The objective of this study is to identify maternal and fetal risk factors that affect leptin and adiponectin levels (markers of adiposity) and adiponectin/leptin ratio (a marker of dysfunctional adipose tissue) at birth., Methods: We studied mother-infant pairs in the Boston Birth Cohort. Cord blood was collected at birth. We used student t- tests to compare log normalized cord leptin and adiponectin levels. Regression analysis was performed to examine the association of maternal and fetal factors with leptin and adiponectin levels and adiponectin:leptin ratio at birth in both term and preterm infants., Results: We analyzed 1012 infants (245 preterm). Both cord leptin and adiponectin were higher in term infants than preterm infants (10.2 +/- 0.9 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.3, P < 0.0001 and 9.5 +/- 0.7 vs. 8.9 +/- 0.8, P < 0.0001, respectively). Cord leptin was higher for Black infants (10.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 9.9 +/- 1.2; P < 0.001) although Black (ref: non-Black) infants had lower cord adiponectin levels (9.3 +/- 0.8 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.7; P = 0.01). Ratio of adiponectin to leptin (log normalized) was higher in preterm infants (-0.24) vs. term infants (-0.69). On regression analysis, cord leptin was positively associated with longer gestational age (GA), birth weight z score, Black race, maternal overweight and obesity, gestational diabetes and pregestational diabetes mellitus and negatively associated with male sex. Cord adiponectin was positively associated with GA, birth weight z score and negatively with Black race and male sex. Adiponectin:leptin ratio was positively with male sex and negatively with GA, birth weight z score, Black race, gestational DM, pregestational DM and maternal overweight and obesity., Conclusions: We identified several factors that affect leptin and adiponectin levels along with adiponectin-leptin ratio at birth beyond GA and birth weight which could also play an important role in influencing the trajectory of these hormones and future cardiometabolic outcomes. This knowledge can help tailor precision nutrition interventions. Copyright © 2022 The Author(s), Published by Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Adipose tissue is involved in the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism, energy balance, inflammation and immune response. Abdominal obesity plays a key role in the development of insulin resistance because of the high lipolytic rate of visceral adipose tissue and its secretion of adipocytokines. Low birth weight subjects are prone to central redistribution of adipose tissue and are at high risk of developing metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Intrauterine adipogenesis may play a key role in the fetal origin of the pathogenesis of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Therefore, knowledge of the behavior of visceral adipose tissue-derived stem cells could provide a greater understanding of the metabolic risk related to intrauterine growth retardation, with potential clinical implications for the prevention of long-term metabolic alterations.

AB  - Obesity is suggested as a risk factor for asthma, but the mechanisms are unclear. The relationship between obesity and asthma has not been considered in children born with very low-birth weight (VLBW). We hypothesized that overweight was a contributing factor for asthma in VLBW children, and that leptin and leptin-associated cytokines might play roles in overweight-related asthma. Seventy-four VLBW and 64 normal birth weight (NBW) children participated in a 12-yr follow up study assessing asthma and allergy. Twenty-seven (12 VLBW) of the 138 children were overweight according to the proposed international definition. The diagnosis of current asthma was made by a pediatrician. Serum levels of leptin and interferon (IFN)-gamma were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Leptin levels were considerably higher in the overweight than in the non-overweight children (median value: 18.1 vs. 2.8 ng/ml, p < 0.001). In the overweight children, current asthmatics had twice as high levels of leptin as children without current asthma (median value: 30.8 vs. 14.3 ng/ml, p = 0.14), but this was not the case in the non-overweight children. IFN-gamma was more often detected in the overweight than in the non-overweight children (61% vs. 12%, p < 0.001), and there was a positive correlation between the levels of leptin and the levels of IFN-gamma (Rho = 0.40, p < 0.001). In the VLBW group, the overweight children had a significantly increased risk for current asthma compared with the non-overweight children after adjustment for the neonatal risk factors [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5.8, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2-27]. Thus, overweight was associated with asthma in the VLBW children. Our hypothesis remained that leptin might be involved in the pathogenesis of asthma in the overweight children, and IFN-gamma might be a pathway in the process of leptin-induced inflammation.

AB  - Maternal hypertension may alter physiological parameters, dysregulating the release of hormones such as adipokines, thus influencing the fetal growth course. This study investigated whether hypertensive disorders of pregnancy alter cord blood adipokine levels and correlate these with anthropometric parameters in preterm infants. This is a prospective cohort study with pregnant women < 37-week gestation with and without hypertension and their offspring. Cord blood leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin were analyzed by LUMINEX R. These adipokines were compared between the groups exposed or not to gestational hypertension using non-parametric statistical tests. The hypertensive pregnancies had significantly higher cord blood leptin (1.00 (IQR 0.67-1.20 ng/mL)) and adiponectin (18.52 (IQR 17.52-25.13 mug/mL)) levels than those without hypertension (0.07 (IQR 0.06-0.08 ng/mL) and 8.13 (IQR 6.50-8.68 mug/mL), respectively, p < 0.0001). The adipokine levels were higher in AGA and SGA infants in the exposed group for both moderate and late preterm. SGA had significantly higher ghrelin levels than the AGA infants. Ghrelin levels were negatively correlated with birth weight (r = - 0.613, p < 0.001), birth length (r = - 0.510, p < 0.001), head circumference (- 0.346, p < 0.002), and gestational age (r = - 0.612, p < 0.001). Conclusions: Our findings demonstrate an increase in adipokine levels in the cord blood of preterm newborn infants exposed to maternal hypertension. What is Known: * Clinical evidence suggests that concentration of the serum adipokines may be affected by risk of hypertension in both adults and pregnant women. * Maternal profile as hypertension alters intrauterine environment and could affect the function of fetal metabolism, impairing fetal growth. What is New: * Gestational hypertension modifies the adipokine profile, with higher rates already present at birth in cord blood samples. * Within the hypertensive group and stratifying for gestation age, ghrelin concentrations were higher in SGA newborns, both in the moderate and late preterm, compared with AGA newborns.

AB  - The hypothesis of fetal origins to adult diseases proposes that metabolic chronic disorders, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and hypertension originate in the developmental plasticity due to intrauterine insults. These processes involve an adaptative response by the fetus to changes in the environmental signals, which can promote the reset of hormones and of the metabolism to establish a "thrifty phenotype". Metabolic alterations during intrauterine growth restriction can modify the fetal programming. The present nonsystematic review intended to summarize historical and current references that indicated that developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) occur as a consequence of altered maternal and fetal metabolic pathways. The purpose is to highlight the potential implications of growth factors and adipokines in "developmental programming", which could interfere in the development by controlling fetal growth patterns. These changes affect the structure and the functional capacity of various organs, including the brain, the kidneys, and the pancreas. These investigations may improve the approach to optimizing antenatal as well as perinatal care aimed to protect newborns against long-term chronic diseases.

AB  - AIMS: To verify if plasma leptin concentrations of newborns at birth differ significantly between sexes; and to investigate the potential interactions between plasma leptin and growth-regulating hormones at birth., SUBJECTS: 98 healthy newborns (48 male, 50 female) were studied. Leptin, insulin, cortisol, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) concentrations were measured from venous blood collected from the umbilical cord vein immediately after birth., RESULTS: The serum leptin concentration of newborns averaged 8.05(0.5) ng/ml. Females had significantly (P<0.005) higher serum leptin values than males [9. 6(0.8) vs 6.0(0.6) ng/ml]. IGF-1 was significantly (P<0.05) higher in females than in males [87(4) vs 74(5) microg/l], whereas SHBG was slightly lower [29(1) vs 33(2) nmol/l]. Insulin, cortisol, and testosterone serum concentrations were not statistically different between the sexes. Among the variables examined, birth weight (expressed as Z-score of weight) and insulin showed the highest degree of relationship with serum leptin in newborns (r=0.48 and r=0.31 respectively, P<0.001). Multiple regression analysis showed that Z-score of birth weight, gender and cortisol were able to account for approximately 44% of inter-individual variability of serum leptin concentrations in newborns., CONCLUSIONS: Female newborns have significantly higher serum leptin concentrations than males. Insulin, IGF-1, testosterone, and SHBG did not independently affect leptin inter-individual variability when gender, Z-score of body weight, and cortisol were taken into account. Other factors may be involved in the differences in circulating leptin concentrations between the sexes in newborns.

AB  - Leptin can be considered as a peripheral signal which informs the centers about the mass of energy stores. Studies done on the human adult population have demonstrated that degree of adiposity and insulin levels play a major role as determinants of leptin circulating levels. The aim of this study was to evaluate which factors may influence leptin levels at birth. We examined the role played by baby size and by the metabolic environment the fetus was exposed to during pregnancy. We considered 85 newborns from normal (n = 60), gestational (GDM, n = 17) and pregestational (IDDM = 8) diabetes mellitus mothers. At delivery, blood was taken from the umbilical cord vein. Babies from normal and GDM mothers were subdivided into AGA (appropriate for gestational age) and LGA (large for gestational age). There was no difference in leptin levels between babies from normal or GDM mothers belonging to the same weight category, but leptin levels were always higher in LGA than in AGA newborns, and highly correlated with birth weight (r = 0.34, P = 0.001). Moreover, IDDM mothers gave birth to newborns with significantly higher levels of leptin and insulin when compared with normal and GDM mothers. Diabetes of both GDM and IDDM mothers was clinically well controlled (HbA1c was 4.0 and 7.2, respectively). The correlation between leptin and insulin was significant only when newborns from IDDM mothers were included in the regression analysis (r = 0.39, P = 0.0002). Our results suggest that degree of adiposity is one of the main regulators of leptin concentration in the human newborn and that babies exposed to an altered, though clinically controlled, metabolic environment, as in IDDM mothers, have increased levels of leptin.

AB  - Autism spectrum disorder is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social communication and interaction, as well as repetitive and characteristic patterns of behaviour. Although the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorder is unknown, being overweight or obesity during infancy and low weight at birth are known as risks, suggesting a metabolic aspect. In this study, we investigated adipose tissue development as a pathophysiological factor of autism spectrum disorder by examining the serum levels of adipokines and other metabolic markers in autism spectrum disorder children (n = 123) and typically developing children (n = 92) at 4-12 years of age. Among multiple measures exhibiting age-dependent trajectories, the leptin levels displayed different trajectory patterns between autism spectrum disorder and typically developing children, supporting an adipose tissue-dependent mechanism of autism spectrum disorder. Of particular interest, the levels of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) were significantly lower in autism spectrum disorder children than in typically developing subjects, at preschool age (4-6 years old: n = 21 for autism spectrum disorder and n = 26 for typically developing). The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis discriminated autism spectrum disorder children from typically developing children with a sensitivity of 94.4% and a specificity of 75.0%. We re-sequenced the exons of the FABP4 gene in a Japanese cohort comprising 659 autism spectrum disorder and 1000 control samples, and identified two rare functional variants in the autism spectrum disorder group. The Trp98Stop, one of the two variants, was transmitted to the proband from his mother with a history of depression. The disruption of the Fabp4 gene in mice evoked autism spectrum disorder-like behavioural phenotypes and increased spine density on apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons, which has been observed in the postmortem brains of autism spectrum disorder subjects. The Fabp4 knockout mice had an altered fatty acid composition in the cortex. Collectively, these results suggest that an 'adipo-brain axis' may underlie the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorder, with FABP4 as a potential molecule for use as a biomarker.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare macrophage activation in normal and pre-eclamptic pregnancies by determining YKL-40 concentration and chitotriosidase activity in maternal and cord serum., METHODS: In this prospective case-control study samples of maternal peripheral blood and umbilical venous blood were collected from 28 pre-eclamptic and 24 normotensive pregnant women and their newborns. YKL-40 concentration and chitotriosidase activity were determined by enzyme-linked immunoassay and fluorometry, respectively., RESULTS: Chitotriosidase activity in maternal and cord serum and YKL-40 concentration in cord serum were significantly higher in pre-eclamptic pregnancies (P<0.001), but there was no significant difference in maternal serum levels of YKL-40 between the case and control groups (P>0.05). There was a significant positive correlation between diastolic blood pressure and (1) chitotriosidase activity in both maternal and cord serum and (2) cord serum concentration of YKL-40 (r=0.61, r=0.84, and r=0.58, respectively)., CONCLUSION: This study may be the first to demonstrate maternal and fetal macrophage activation in pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is the most prevalent endocrinopathy among women during reproductive age. PCOS is characterised by hyperandrogenaemia, hyperinsulinaemia, and deranged adipokines secretion from the adipose tissue. In addition to the reduced insulin sensitivity, PCOS women exhibit beta-cell dysfunction as well. Low birth weight and foetal exposure to androgens may contribute to the development of the PCOS phenotype during life. Further metabolic complications lead to dyslipidaemia, worsening obesity and glucose tolerance, high prevalence of metabolic syndrome, and greater susceptibility to diabetes. PCOS women show age-related existence of hypertension, and subtle endothelial and vascular changes. Adverse reproductive outcomes include anovulatory infertility, and unrecognised potentiation of the hormone-dependent endometrial cancer. The main therapeutic approach is lifestyle modification. Metformin is the primary insulin-sensitising drug to be used as an adjuvant therapy to lifestyle modification in patients with insulin resistance and impaired glucose tolerance, as well as in those referred to infertility treatment. Thiazolidinediones should be reserved for women intolerant of or refractory to metformin, while glucagon-like peptide 1 analogues has a potential therapeutic use in obese PCOS women. Randomised clinical trials and repetitive studies on different PCOS phenotypes for the preventive actions and therapeutic options are still lacking, though. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The incidence rate of diabetes in pregnancy is about 20%, and diabetes in pregnancy will have a long-term impact on the metabolic health of mothers and their offspring. Mothers may have elevated blood glucose, which may lead to blood pressure disease, kidney disease, decreased resistance and secondary infection during pregnancy. The offspring may suffer from abnormal embryonic development, intrauterine growth restriction, obesity, autism, and other adverse consequences. Resveratrol (RSV) is a natural polyphenol compound, which is found in more than 70 plant species and their products, such as Polygonum cuspidatum, seeds of grapes, peanuts, blueberries, bilberries, and cranberries. Previous studies have shown that RSV has a potential beneficial effect on complex pregnancy, including improving the indicators of diabetes and pregnancy diabetes syndrome. This article has reviewed the molecular targets and signaling pathways of RSV, including AMP-activated protein kinase, mitogen-activated protein kinases, silent information regulator sirtuin 1, miR-23a-3p, reactive oxygen species, potassium channels and CX3C chemokine ligand 1, and the effect of RSV on gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and its complications. RSV improves the indicators of GDM by improving glucose metabolism and insulin tolerance, regulating blood lipids and plasma adipokines, and modulating embryonic oxidative stress and apoptosis. Furthermore, RSV can ameliorate the GDM complications by reducing oxidative stress, reducing the effects on placentation, reducing the adverse effects on embryonic development, reducing offspring's healthy risk, and so on. Thus, this review is of great significance for providing more options and possibilities for further research on medication of gestational diabetes. Copyright ©The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a significant pregnancy-related condition, which showed effect on the development of fetal. Anti-inflammatory and antioxidant therapy commonly used for the treatment of GDM. Nimbolide already confirmed their anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effect against various animal disease model. Our objective in this research is to investigate the protective effect of nimbolide against STZ induced GDM and elucidate the mechanism. Methods In this experimental study, pregnant female Wistar rats were used and STZ (40 mg/kg) was used to induce the GDM. Blood glucose level (BGL), body weight and plasma insulin were assessed at regular time (gestational day 0, 9, and 18). Water intake, food intake, fecal and urine output were also estimated. In the female rats, hemoglobin (Hb), glycalated hemoglobin (HbA1c), hepatic glycogen, fructosamine, adiponectin, leptin, lipid, antioxidant and inflammatory cytokines parameters were estimated. In the fetuses, the fetues weight, implementation loss, and fetal weight were estimated. At the completion of the protocol, biochemical parameters were calculated. Gut microbiota was estimated in end of the study. Results Nimbolide treatment significantly (p < .001) improved the fetuses level and suppressed the fetal weight and implantation loss. Nimbolide treatment significantly (p < .001) suppressed the BGL and enhanced the body weight, insulin level. Nimbolide treatment suppressed the water intake, food intake, urinary and fecal output. Nimbolide significantly (p < .001) suppressed the fructosamine, leptin and enhanced the adiponectin level. Nimbolide treatment significantly (p < .001) decreased the malonaldehyde (MDA) level and boosted the total antioxidant capacity (TAC), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), glutathione S-transferase (GST) and catalase (CAT); suppressed the level of TNF-alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and boosted the level of IL-10. Furthermore, nimbolide treatment reversed the gut microbiota alteration induced via STZ in female rats. At the phylum level, the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes relative abundance was altered via nimbolide treatment. The ratio of F/B boosted in GDM group and nimbolide treatment significantly (p < .001) suppressed. Nimbolide considerably suppressed the firmicutes and enhanced the Bacteroidetes,CAG-352, Lacnospirace. Conclusion Based on the findings, we may conclude that nimbolide protects the pregnant rats from GDM via alteration of inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate how maternal dietary patterns and maternal/fetal cytokines are associated with birth weight and whether cytokines mediate the association. A total of 469 pregnant women and their children were recruited for this prospective study. Dietary patterns in pregnancy were identified using factor analysis of data from three consecutive 24 h dietary recalls. Maternal and umbilical blood serum cytokines (adiponectin (APN), IL-6 and interferon-gamma) were measured via ELISA. Path analysis was used to explore the relationships between maternal diet, cytokines and birth weight. Four dietary patterns were identified: a mainly fruit, dairy products and poultry diet (FDP); a mainly vegetables, beans and pork diet (VBP); a mainly fish, shrimp and soup diet (FS) and a mainly tuber and egg diet (TE). Path analysis showed the order of effects of dietary patterns on birth weight was FS>FDP>TE>VBP (beta=0.130, 0.109, -0.094 and 0.046, respectively). Only the TE pattern's effect was negative. Maternal and fetal APN were positively associated with birth weight (beta=0.045 and 0.226, respectively), and they mediated the association between the TE pattern and birth weight (indirect effect was 5.3 %). Maternal IL-6 was negatively associated with birth weight (beta=-0.067) and mediated the association between maternal FDP and VBP patterns and birth weight (indirect effects were 10.1 and 100.0 %, respectively). All variables in the path explained 33.6 % of variation. These results suggested that maternal dietary patterns in pregnancy are associated with birth weight and mediated directly and indirectly through some maternal/fetal serum cytokines.

AB  - Background: Accumulating evidence reveals that music therapy appears to help patients with pain. However, there is a limited understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Several studies indicate that leptin level has a crucial relationship with acute and chronic pain. Herein, we evaluated the effects of music stimulation and the potential roles of adipokines (leptin) in pain behaviors. Methods: We used a tibial neuroma transposition (TNT) rat model to mimic neuroma pain. Adult male Sprague- Dawley rats were randomly assigned to one of the three groups (n = 6):group 1 (GC), TNT with white noise; group 2(GM), TNT with music; and group 3(GH), TNT. White noise and music stimulation was given once a day following surgery until the end of the study (42nd day). Pain behavioral tests were carried out before surgery and on the 3rd, 10th, 14th, 21st, 28th,35th, and 42nd days after surgery. At the end of the observation period, we analyzed the histological samples of blood, spinal cord, and prefrontal cortex to investigate the role of leptin in pain behaviors modulated by white noise and sound stimulation. Result: Music therapy might improve the pain of TNT rats. Music stimulation ameliorated paw withdrawal thermal latency (PWTL) from the 3rd day after the surgery while the mechanical pain was improved 21 days after the operation. Music stimulation also increased leptin expression in the spinal cord, prefrontal cortex. White noise had no obvious effect. Conclusion: Music therapy might improve the pain of TNT rats. Besides, music stimulation ameliorated TNT-induced pain behaviors and affected leptin expression.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are predisposed to obesity, insulin resistance (IR), and lipid disorders. The HOMA-IR index is commonly used to assess IR (IRIHOMA), calculated from fasting glucose and insulin. However, sometimes, during the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), elevated and prolonged postprandial insulin secretion is observed despite normal fasting insulin levels. IRIBelfiore is an IR index that analyses glucose and insulin levels during OGTT according to the method proposed by Belfiore., THE AIM OF THE STUDY: was to assess the frequency of IR based on IRIHOMA and IRIBelfiore results in SGA children aged 6-8 years, after catch-up phenomenon, to determine the usefulness of IRIBelfiore in diagnosis of IR and in predicting future metabolic complications., MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 129 SGA normal-height children, aged 6-8 years, height, weight, waist circumference, blood pressure, as well as lipids, IGF-1, cortisol, C-peptide, leptin, adiponectin, and resistin concentrations were measured. The glucose and insulin concentrations were evaluated at 0, 60, and 120 minutes of OGTT., RESULTS: IRIHOMA was normal in all children, while elevated IRIBelfiore was found in 22.5% of them. Children with IR diagnosed by IRIBelfiore were taller, had higher blood pressure, higher leptin, and lower HDL-cholesterol concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: It seems worth recommending IRIBelfiore derived from OGTT as a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying IR in SGA prepubertal children. Abnormal IRIBelfiore is related to higher blood pressure and lower HDL-cholesterol concentration in this group.

AB  - Background: The breast milk bioactive substances such as adiponectin, have a presumably long-term impact upon the health and well-being of a child. Aim: To determine the impact of probiotic-supplemented dietary counseling during pregnancy on colostrum adiponectin concentration. Study design and subjects: Altogether 256 pregnant women were randomized into three study groups: dietary intervention with probiotics (diet/probiotics) or with placebo (diet/placebo) and a control group (control/placebo). The intervention group received dietary counseling provided by a nutritionist, the main focus being the amount and the type of dietary fat. The probiotics used were Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG and Bifidobacterium lactis in combination. Dietary intake was evaluated by food records at every trimester of pregnancy. Breast milk samples were collected after birth (colostrum) for adiponectin concentration analysis (n = 181). Results: The dietary intervention increased the colostrum adiponectin concentration (ng/mL, geometric mean [95% Cl]), the difference being significant when comparing to the control group; 12.7 [10.6-29.7] vs. 10.2 [9.9-13.2], P = 0.024. Maternal weight gain during pregnancy (kg) correlated inversely with colostrum adiponectin concentration; beta (SE) = - 1.7 (0.1), P = 0.020, and gestational diabetes mellitus was associated with the likelihood of adiponectin concentration falling into the lowest quartile; OR 2.36, 95% Cl 1.1-3.2, P = 0.028. Conclusions: In showing that the colostrum adiponectin concentration is markedly dependent on maternal diet and nutritional status during pregnancy, and considering that colostrum adiponectin has potential effects on metabolism, nutrition, and immune function in the neonates, the results of this study underscore the importance of the metabolic homeostasis of the mother for the child's initial nutritional environment.

AB  - Objective: The aim of the study was to characterize early nutritional and microbiological environments (maternal colostrum adiponectin concentration and early gut microbiota composition) in children subsequently becoming normal weight versus overweight. Patients and Methods: Fifteen overweight children at 10 years of age were identified from an ongoing prospective nutrition, allergy, mucosal immunology and intestinal microbiota project. Normal-weight children (n = 15), matched for sex, gestational age and body mass index at birth, mode of delivery, probiotic intervention, and duration of breast-feeding, were identified from the same cohort as controls. To characterize the early dietary environment we analyzed the adiponectin concentration in the maternal colostrum. With an aim to assess the initial microbiological environment, we analyzed the gut microbiota composition by fluorescent in situ hybridization in these children at the age of 3 months. Additionally, putative early markers of low-grade inflammation, such as serum-soluble innate microbial receptor sCD14, were analyzed at the age of 3 months. Results: The colostrum adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in mothers whose children were normal weight than in those whose children were overweight at the age of 10 years (P = 0.001). In parallel, the normal-weight children had significantly higher sCD14 concentrations in the serum (P = 0.049) and tended to have higher bifidobacterial numbers in the gut microbiota (P = 0.087) at the age of 3 months. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest that early dietary and gut microbiological environments have a more complex effect on the metabolic programming of a child than previously anticipated.

AB  - In vitro cell model studies have shown that oxidative stress may affect beta-cell function. It is unknown whether oxidative stress may affect metabolic health in human fetuses/newborns. In a singleton pregnancy cohort (n = 248), we studied maternal (24-28 weeks gestation) and cord plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress [malondialdehyde (MDA), F2-isoprostanes] in relation to fetal metabolic health biomarkers including cord plasma glucose-to-insulin ratio (an indicator of insulin sensitivity), proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (an indicator of beta-cell function), insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, leptin, adiponectin and ghrelin concentrations. Strong positive correlations were observed between maternal and cord plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress (r = 0.33 for MDA, r = 0.74 for total F2-isoprostanes, all p < 0.0001). Adjusting for gestational age at blood sampling, cord plasma ghrelin concentrations were consistently negatively correlated to oxidative stress biomarkers in maternal (r = -0.32, p < 0.0001 for MDA; r = -0.31, p < 0.0001 for F2-isoprostanes) or cord plasma (r = -0.13, p = 0.04 for MDA; r = -0.32, p < 0.0001 for F2-isoprostanes). Other fetal metabolic health biomarkers were not correlated to oxidative stress. Adjusting for maternal and pregnancy characteristics, similar associations were observed. Our study provides the first preliminary evidence suggesting that oxidative stress may affect fetal ghrelin levels in humans. The implications in developmental "programming" the vulnerability to metabolic syndrome related disorders remain to be elucidated.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: It remains uncertain whether leptin and adiponectin levels are correlated in maternal vs. fetal circulations. Little is known about whether leptin and adiponectin affect insulin sensitivity during fetal life., DESIGN AND METHODS: In a prospective singleton pregnancy cohort (n = 248), we investigated leptin and adiponectin concentrations in maternal (at 24-28 and 32-35 weeks of gestation) and fetal circulations, and their associations with fetal insulin sensitivity (glucose/insulin ratio, proinsulin level)., RESULTS: Comparing concentrations in cord vs. maternal blood, leptin levels were 50% lower, but adiponectin levels more than doubled. Adjusting for gestational age at blood sampling, consistent and similar positive correlations (correlation coefficients: 0.31-0.34, all P < 0.0001) were observed in leptin or adiponectin levels in maternal (at 24-28 or 32-25 weeks of gestation) vs. fetal circulations. For each SD increase in maternal plasma concentration at 24-28 weeks, cord plasma concentration increased by 12.7 (95% confidence interval 6.8-18.5) ng/ml for leptin, and 2.9 (1.8-4.0) microg/ml for adiponectin, respectively (adjusted P < 0.0001). Fetal insulin sensitivity was negatively associated with cord blood leptin (each SD increase was associated with a 5.4 (2.1-8.7) mg/dl/microU/ml reduction in cord plasma glucose/insulin ratio, and a 5.6 (3.9, 7.4) pmol/l increase in proinsulin level, all adjusted P < 0.01) but not adiponectin (P > 0.4) levels). Similar associations were observed in nondiabetic full-term pregnancies (n = 211)., CONCLUSIONS: The results consistently suggest a maternal impact on fetal leptin and adiponectin levels, which may be an early life pathway in maternal-fetal transmission of the propensity to obesity and insulin resistance.

AB  - The recognition of the association between birth weight and adult obesity has led to research into early-life influences. Research into the developmental origins of health and disease has focused mainly on obesity and the metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disorders, but asthma and other respiratory disorders are also affected by early exposures. A number of factors may be common to both asthma and obesity and may predispose individuals to expressing both phenotypes. This article describes the epidemiology of obesity and asthma. In addition, the shared genetic contribution to obesity and asthma is discussed, as well as the role of prenatal diet and the impact of intestinal microflora on the development of obesity and asthma.

AB  - The adipokine leptin is expressed at higher concentrations in obese subjects, who also incidentally have a higher prevalence of hypertension. The pathogenesis of this obesity-related hypertension is controversial and is believed to be related to many factors including increased sympathetic activity, abnormalities of the renin-angiotensin system, sodium retention, and an endotheliopathy acting independently or in concert with increased circulating leptin. This review discusses the potential mechanisms through which changes in leptin signal transduction pathways in tissues with the leptin receptor, especially the hypothalamus, mediate the pathogenetic relationships between obesity and hypertension. The hypothesis is explored that leptin effects on blood pressure (BP) are meditated by the downstream effects of hypothalamic leptin signaling and ultimately result in activation of specific melanocortin receptors located on sympathetic neurons in the spinal cord. The physiological consequences of this sympathetic activation of the heart and kidney are activation of the renin-angiotensin system, sodium retention and circulatory expansion and finally, elevated BP. This sequence of events has been elegantly demonstrated with leptin infusion and gene knockout studies in animal models but has not been convincingly reproducibly confirmed in humans. Further studies in human subjects on the specific roles of hypothalamic leptin in essential hypertension are indicated as elucidation of the signaling pathways should provide better understanding of the role of weight loss in BP control and afford an additional mechanism for pharmacologic control of BP in adults and children at risk of cardiovascular disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationships between serum leptin levels and maternal weights in late pregnancy and cord blood leptin levels to birth-weights, C-peptide, insulin and insulin like growth factor (IGF-II)., METHODS: Fifty normal pregnant women at 37-38 weeks and their newborns were studied, and 29 non-pregnant women were set as control. Venous blood was taken from women and from the cord at delivery. Blood leptin and cord blood C-peptide, insulin, and IGF-II were measured by radio-immunoassay., RESULTS: The average leptin level in maternal sera was (13.62 +/- 3.68) micrograms/L, significantly higher than that in the control (6.60 +/- 3.04) micrograms/L and that in cord blood (8.05 +/- 4.61) micrograms/L. Maternal leptin levels were significantly correlated with maternal weights and body mass index (BMI. r = 0.33, 0.35, P < 0.05), but not with infant birth-weights (r = 0.10, P > 0.05). Cord blood leptin levels were significantly correlated with birth-weights and BMI (r = 0.54, 0.49, P < 0.001) but have no correlation with maternal leptin levels (r = 0.19, P > 0.05). Significant difference of the cord leptin levels was not seen between the males and females. The cord blood C-peptide was (0.86 +/- 0.35) microgram/L, insulin (8.49 +/- 4.76) mU/L and IGF-II (0.218 +/- 0.076) microgram/T. Cord leptin levels were correlated with C-peptide levels (r = 0.37, P < 0.05), but not with insulin and IGF-II levels (r = 0.19, -0.14, P > 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal leptin levels in late pregnancy were significantly higher than those in normal non-pregnant women and positively correlated with maternal weights and BMI. Cord blood leptin levels were positively correlated with birth-weights and BMI of the newborns. The leptin levels of cord blood were correlated with those of C-peptide but not insulin and IGF-II.

AB  - CONTEXT: Inflammatory mediators are associated with type 2 and gestational diabetes. It is unknown whether there are associations with glucose in pregnant women with lesser degrees of hyperglycemia., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine associations of inflammatory mediators with maternal glucose levels and neonatal size in a subset of participants in the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome (HAPO) Study., DESIGN: Eligible pregnant women underwent a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test between 24 and 32 wk gestation, and levels of C-peptide, adiponectin, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1), C-reactive protein (CRP), and resistin were measured in fasting serum samples. Associations of inflammatory mediators with maternal glucose and with birth size were assessed using multiple linear regression analyses, adjusting for maternal body mass index (BMI), fasting C-peptide, and other potential confounders., RESULTS: Mean levels of adiponectin declined, and PAI-1 and CRP increased across increasing levels of maternal glucose, BMI, and C-peptide. For example, for fasting plasma glucose less than 75 mg/dl and fasting plasma glucose of 90 mg/dl or greater, adiponectin was 22.5 and 17.4 mug/ml and PAI-1 was 30.9 and 34.2 ng/ml, respectively. Associations with 1- and 2-h plasma glucose remained significant for adiponectin (P<0.001), PAI-1 (P<0.05), and CRP (P<0.01) after adjustment for BMI and C-peptide. Adiponectin and CRP were inversely associated with birth weight, sum of skinfolds and percent body fat, and PAI-1 with sum of skinfolds (all P<0.05) after adjustment for confounders. Resistin was not associated with 1- or 2-h glucose or birth size., CONCLUSION: Levels of inflammatory mediators are associated with levels of maternal glucose in pregnant women without overt diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Visfatin is an adipocytokine involved in insulin action and oxidative stress. The regulation of circulating concentrations in the human foetus is unknown. We studied whether, at term birth, the serum concentrations of visfatin are related to foetal size, both in the absence and in the presence of maternal smoking during pregnancy., DESIGN: A cross-sectional, hospital-based study., PATIENTS: Seventy-eight singleton, healthy neonates [39 girls and 39 boys; gestational age (GA) 39.5 +/- 0.2 weeks; birth weight (BW) 3.3 +/- 0.04 kg]., METHODS: Cord serum visfatin, insulin and IGF-I measured by specific immunoassays., RESULTS: In infants from nonsmoking mothers (N = 48), cord serum visfatin levels were unrelated to either BW or birth length (BL). In infants from smoking mothers (N = 30), however, serum visfatin was inversely associated with both BW (r = -0.57; P < 0.001) and BL (r = -0.60; P < 0.0001) and it was directly associated with the number of cigarettes smoked (P < 0.05) in heavy smokers. In a multiple regression analysis, cord serum visfatin accounted for 36% of BW and 32% of BL variance in infants from smoking mothers. Cord serum visfatin was unrelated to insulin or IGF-I in either subgroup., CONCLUSION: At term birth, there is no readily detectable relation between circulating visfatin and indices of foetal size; however, maternal smoking unmasked a strikingly inverse relationship between cord serum visfatin and the foetal growth status, indicating that smoking can elicit a rise or a fall of cord serum visfatin, depending on whether the foetus is, respectively, of smaller or larger size.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the genetic determinants of fat mass around birth. We hypothesized that the common rs9939609 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FTO is associated with fat mass and metabolic parameters in neonates., DESIGN: We conducted a cross-sectional, hospital-based study., PATIENTS: Patients included 234 full-term, healthy newborns [122 girls and 112 boys; gestational age (mean, range), 39.0 (37.0-42.0) wk; birth weight, 3.2 (1.9-4.2) kg]., METHODS: Cord-blood insulin, IGF-I, IGF-binding protein-1, adiponectin, and visfatin were measured by specific immunoassays. Body composition was assessed by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry at about 13 d (range, 9-20 d). Genotyping of rs9939609 was achieved by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis., RESULTS: The rs9939609 SNP in FTO was not associated with birth weight; however, it was associated with serum visfatin (P < 0.001), with weight and ponderal index at age 2 wk (P < 0.05), and with total, truncal, and abdominal fat (P < 0.05 to P = 0.01), so that AA homozygotes had 37% higher plasma visfatin concentration and 17, 20, and 17% higher total, truncal, and abdominal fat mass, respectively, than T-carrier neonates., CONCLUSION: Our findings support a role of the common rs9939609 SNP in FTO gene in the early stages of fat accretion in humans and disclose novel associations between this SNP and both serum visfatin and abdominal fat mass in neonates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance has been linked to intrauterine growth restriction; adiponectin is a strong determinant of insulin sensitivity. We aimed at studying the contributions of birthweight and insulin sensitivity to circulating adiponectin in children born small for gestational age (SGA)., DESIGN: Cross-sectional, hospital-based study dealing with insulin sensitivity in SGA children., PATIENTS: Thirty-two prepubertal children born SGA (age 5.4 +/- 2.9 years) and 37 prepubertal children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA, age 5.9 +/- 3.0 years)., MEASUREMENTS: Serum levels of fasting glucose, serum lipids, insulin (immunometric assay) and adiponectin concentrations (ELISA) were assessed, and insulin resistance (IR) and insulin secretion (beta-cell) were calculated by the homeostasis model of assessment (HOMA)., RESULTS: SGA children had similar HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta-cell and adiponectin concentrations than AGA children. However, in a separate analysis of subjects older than 3 years of age, SGA children showed higher HOMA-IR after adjusting for sex, age and body mass index (BMI) standard deviation score (SDS). Circulating adiponectin was higher in SGA children [adjusted means: 14.5 mg/l (95% CI 12.9-16.1) and 18.7 mg/l (95% CI 17.0-20.3) for AGA and SGA children, respectively; P < 0.0001]. Further analysis revealed that the group of overweight SGA (arbitrarily defined as being in the higher quartile for the BMI SDS distribution in the sample) had decreased serum concentrations of adiponectin, compared to lean SGA children [adjusted means: 12.9 mg/l (95% CI 9.3-16.5) vs. 19.0 (95% CI 16.8-21.3), respectively; P = 0.001]. In a multiple regression model, HOMA-IR and SGA status explained 35% and 15% of adiponectin variance, respectively., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal growth restriction is associated with insulin resistance but relatively increased adiponectin concentrations, provided overweight does not ensue. The contributions of circulating adiponectin to the increased risks for developing insulin resistance and type-2 diabetes in formerly SGA subjects merit further studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and adiponectin are strongly related to insulin sensitivity; insulin resistance of pregnancy is a major determinant of infant's birthweight. We aimed to study the contributions of maternal serum concentrations of soluble TNF-alpha receptors (sTNFR1 and sTNFR2) and adiponectin to infant's birthweight., DESIGN: Cross-sectional, hospital-based study of insulin sensitivity during gestation., PATIENTS: Fifty-one healthy women with uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery (except for elective Caesarian section) and their healthy newborn infants. measurements Maternal blood levels of glucose, insulin, glycosylated haemaglobin (HbA1c), sTNFR1, sTNFR2 and adiponectin at delivery; cord-blood levels of sTNFR1, sTNFR2 and adiponectin., RESULTS: At delivery, maternal sTNFR2 correlated with systolic blood pressure (SBP; r = 0.38, P = 0.005). In multiple regression analyses, SBP and HbA1c were independent predictors of sTNFR2, explaining 18 and 7% of its variance, respectively; insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), body mass index at delivery and SBP were independent predictors of adiponectin, explaining 15, 8 and 7% of its variance, respectively. Both maternal sTNFR2 and SBP were negatively correlated with infant's birthweight (r = -0.28, P = 0.04 and r = -0.36, P = 0.01 respectively, adjusted for sex and gestational age). In multivariate regression analyses, infant's sex and either maternal sTNFR2 or adiponectin were independent predictors of infant's birthweight, each explaining between 6 and 9% of birthweight variance. Further addition of maternal SBP to these models revealed that this variable was the main predictor of infant's birthweight, explaining 13% of its variance., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal sTNFR2 and adiponectin are independently related to both maternal blood pressure and infant's birthweight in uncomplicated pregnancy. The contributions of the TNF-alpha system and adiponectin to hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and fetal growth merit further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The pathophysiology of gestational diabetes itself causes hyperstimulation of adipose tissue and of the placenta cells increasing the production of inflammatory cytokines, which cause changes in the tissues exposed such as the placenta and foetus. Therefore, the objective of this study was to compare metabolic markers and endothelial dysfunction in umbilical cord blood, as well as to determine the presence of atherosclerosis in the placentas of newborn infants of patients with gestational diabetes and in patients with normally progressing pregnancies., PATIENTS AND METHOD: An analytical cross-sectional study was carried out in 84 patients, obtaining data such as age, smoking and weight gain in pregnancy; the gestational age of the newborns was determined by Capurro, and their weight and destination subsequent to birth, the placentas were also collected in order to look for atherosclerosis through histological studies and glucose, insulin, VLDL-C, HDL-C, triglycerides, cholesterol, fibrinogen, PCR and markers of endothelial dysfunction (adiponectin, VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and IL-6) were determined in blood samples obtained from the umbilical cord., RESULTS: Placental atherosclerosis presented in 28.94% of the group with gestational diabetes compared to 10.52% of the group with normally progressing pregnancies (P=.044); differences were found in glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, fibrinogen, HOMA-IR, PCR-us, HDL-C, not in VLDL-C. Twenty-one point five percent of the newborns of the gestational diabetes patients required hospitalization, against 5.2% in the control group,, CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancies that involve diabetes have higher proportion of atherosclerosis, hospitalization of the newborn, insulin resistance, as well as elevation of markers associated with inflammation and endothelial dysfunction in umbilical cord blood.

AB  - The association of anthropometric (waist circumference) and hemodynamic (blood pressure) changes with abnormalities in glucose and lipid metabolism has been motivation for a lot of discussions in the last 30 years. Nowadays, blood pressure, body mass index/abdominal circumference, glycemia, triglyceridemia, and HDL-cholesterol concentrations are considered in the definition of Metabolic syndrome, referred as Visceral adiposity syndrome (VAS) in the present review. However, more than 250 years ago an association between visceral and mediastinal obesity with hypertension, gout, and obstructive apnea had already been recognized. Expansion of visceral adipose tissue secondary to chronic over-consumption of calories stimulates the recruitment of macrophages, which assume an inflammatory phenotype and produce cytokines that directly interfere with insulin signaling, resulting in insulin resistance. In turn, insulin resistance (IR) manifests itself in various tissues, contributing to the overall phenotype of VAS. For example, in white adipose tissue, IR results in lipolysis, increased free fatty acids release and worsening of inflammation, since fatty acids can bind to Toll-like receptors. In the liver, IR results in increased hepatic glucose production, contributing to hyperglycemia; in the vascular endothelium and kidney, IR results in vasoconstriction, sodium retention and, consequently, arterial hypertension. Other players have been recognized in the development of VAS, such as genetic predisposition, epigenetic factors associated with exposure to an unfavourable intrauterine environment and the gut microbiota. More recently, experimental and clinical studies have shown the autonomic nervous system participates in modulating visceral adipose tissue. The sympathetic nervous system is related to adipose tissue function and differentiation through beta1, beta2, beta3, alpha1, and alpha2 adrenergic receptors. The relation is bidirectional: sympathetic denervation of adipose tissue blocks lipolysis to a variety of lipolytic stimuli and adipose tissue send inputs to the brain. An imbalance of sympathetic/parasympathetic and alpha2 adrenergic/beta3 receptor is related to visceral adipose tissue storage and insulin sensitivity. Thus, in addition to the well-known factors classically associated with VAS, abnormal autonomic activity also emerges as an important factor regulating white adipose tissue, which highlights complex role of adipose tissue in the VAS.Copyright © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND We previously reported that offspring heterozygous mice partially lacking endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) gene, and born to hypertensive eNOS(-/-) Knockout mother, are hypertensive. We hypothesized that those offspring when placed on high-fat diet (HFD) will undergo altered metabolic programming increasing their risk for developing metabolic syndrome. METHODS eNOS(-/-)KO and wild-type mice (eNOS(+/+)WT) were cross-bred to produce heterozygous offspring: maternal heterozygous (Mat, eNOS(-/+)), born from hypertensive eNOS(-/-) KO mothers; and paternal heterozygous (Pat, eNOS(-/+)), born from normotensive WT mothers. Mat, eNOS(-/+) and Pat, eNOS(-/+) female were allocated to HFD or control diet (CD) until 8 weeks of age. Then a metabolic profile was obtained: weight, glucose/insulin tolerance test (GTT, ITT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), serum fasting levels of insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and a lipid panel. RESULTS Weight was not different between all offspring within each diet. GTT curve was higher in Mat, eNOS(-/+) vs. Pat, eNOS(-/+) offspring on both diet (P < 0.001). In ITT, glucose level at 15 minutes was higher in Mat, eNOS(-/+) on HFD. Insulin level was increased in Mat, eNOS(-/+) vs. Pat, eNOS(-/+) on either diet. SBP was elevated in Mat, eNOS(-/+) vs. Pat, eNOS(-/+) on CD and was further raised in Mat, eNOS(-/+) offspring on HFD (P < 0.001). No other differences were seen except for lower high-density lipoprotein levels in Mat, eNOS(-/+) fed HFD (P < 0.003). CONCLUSIONS Mat, eNOS(-/+) offspring exposed in utero to maternal hypertension and fed HFD postnatally have increased susceptibility for metabolic abnormalities. Thus, maternal HTN is a risk factor for altered fetal metabolic programming.

AB  - Gestational weight gain (GWG) is an important modifiable factor known to influence fetal outcomes including birth weight and adiposity. Unlike behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, the effect of GWG throughout pregnancy on fetal development and other outcomes has not been extensively studied. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of GWG with endocrine factors such as adiponectin, leptin, and C-reactive protein which may be associated with inflammatory response, fetal growth, and adiposity later in life. Data were obtained from the Ulm Birth Cohort Study (UBCS) and the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, two methodologically similar birth cohort studies including newborns and their mothers recruited from 11/2000-11/2001 and 04/2012-05/2013. In the two included birth cohorts we consistently observed statistically significant positive associations between GWG beginning as early as the second trimester with fetal cord blood leptin and stronger association beginning as early as the first trimester with post-delivery maternal serum leptin. Total weight gain exceeding commonly accepted recommended guidelines was consistently associated with higher leptin levels in both cord blood and post-delivery maternal serum. These results suggest a potential pathomechanistic link between fetal environment and surrogate markers of long-term health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have reported associations between delivery mode and health outcomes in infancy and later life. Previous smaller studies indicated a relationship between delivery mode and newborn inflammation potentially constituting a mediating factor. We aimed to determine the influence of delivery mode and duration of labor on cord blood concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP)., METHODS: In the Ulm SPATZ Health Study, 934 singleton newborns and their mothers were recruited during their hospital stay in the University Medical Center Ulm, Southern Germany, from 04/2012-05/2013. Inflammatory biomarkers were measured by ELISAs (n = 836). Delivery mode was analyzed categorically (elective cesarean (reference), active labor delivery: emergency cesarean, assisted vaginal, and spontaneous vaginal); duration of labor continuously. Following log-transformation, linear regression was used to estimate geometric means ratios (GMR) adjusted for potential confounders for the effects of delivery mode and duration of labor on each biomarker separately. Independent replication was sought in the similarly conducted Ulm Birth Cohort Study recruited from 11/2000-11/2001., RESULTS: Individually, active labor delivery modes as well as increasing duration of labor were associated with higher leptin and hs-CRP concentrations. After mutual adjustment, the associations with delivery modes were attenuated but those for duration of labor remained statistically significant (GMR (95%CI) 1.10 (1.00; 1.21) and 1.15 (1.04; 1.27) for leptin and hs-CRP per hour of labor, respectively). No significant adjusted associations were observed between delivery modes and adiponectin concentrations. These findings were replicated in an independent birth cohort study., CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood leptin and hs-CRP concentrations were associated with duration of labor rather than delivery mode. Further research is warranted to investigate these associations with additional cytokines involved in inflammatory response to delineate the inflammatory profile. Subsequently, research on determinants of these associations and their role in development of chronic disease is needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fetal growth process is governed by multiple factors. We investigated the relation of insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), leptin, and interleukin-6 (IL-6) with intrauterine growth in preterm and term neonates., METHODS: Thirty-eight preterm and 43 term neonates were recruited. Anthropometric measures were recorded and umbilical cord blood samples were collected at birth., RESULTS: Birth weight (BW), birth length (BL), ponderal index, head circumference (HC), and cord serum levels of albumin, prealbumin, retinol-binding protein (RBP), total and free IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-3, acid-labile subunit (ALS), and leptin were significantly lower, whereas levels of IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IL-6 were significantly higher in preterm than in term neonates (P < 0.05). Total and free IGF-I, ALS, and leptin had significantly positive correlations, whereas IGFBP-2 had a significantly negative correlation, with BW and BL in preterm plus term neonates. Forward stepwise multivariate regression analysis showed that gestational age (GA), IGFBP-2, leptin, and free IGF-I are significant predictors of BW; GA, IGFBP-2, ALS, transferrin, and leptin are significant predictors of BL; and GA and free IGF-I are significant predictors of HC in preterm and term neonates., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IGF-I, IGF-II, IGFBP-2, ALS, and leptin play important roles in intrauterine growth.

AB  - Objective. Spinal cord injury (SCI) has become popular in recent years, and cognitive decline is a common complication. Adiponectin is a common protein hormone involved in the course of many diseases, but its relationship with SCI has not yet been elucidated. The purpose of our prospective study is to explore whether adiponectin can be used as a biomarker of cognitive decline in SCI. Methods. A total of 64 healthy volunteers and 92 patients with acute SCI were recruited by us. Serum adiponectin levels, demographic data (age and gender), lifestyle (smoking and drinking), medical history (diabetes and hypertension), and clinical baseline data (low-density lipoprotein, high-density lipoprotein, and fasting blood glucose) were recorded. Three months after enrollment, we used the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to evaluate cognitive function. Based on a quarter of the serum adiponectin levels, SCI patients were divided into 4 groups, and the differences in their MoCA scores were compared. In addition, we used multivariate linear regression to predict the risk factors of the MoCA score. Results. The serum adiponectin level (6.1 & PLUSMN;1.1 mu g/ml) of SCI patients was significantly lower than that of the healthy control group (6.7 & PLUSMN;0.9 mu g/ml), and there was a significant difference between the two (p < 0.001). The group with higher serum adiponectin levels after 3 months of spinal cord injury had higher MoCA scores. Multivariate regression analysis showed that serum adiponectin level is a protective factor for cognitive function after SCI (beta=0.210, p=0.043). Conclusions. Serum adiponectin levels can be used as an independent predictor of cognitive function in patients with acute SCI.

AB  - Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in dysregulation of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism; the underlying cellular and physiological mechanisms remain unclear. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a circulating protein primarily secreted by the liver that lowers blood glucose levels, corrects abnormal lipid profiles, and mitigates non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. FGF21 acts via activating FGF receptor 1 and ss-klotho in adipose tissue and stimulating release of adiponectin from adipose tissue which in turn signals in the liver and skeletal muscle. We examined FGF21/adiponectin signaling after spinal cord transection in mice fed a high fat diet (HFD) or a standard mouse chow. Tissues were collected at 84 days after spinal cord transection or a sham SCI surgery. SCI reduced serum FGF21 levels and hepatic FGF21 expression, as well as beta-klotho and FGF receptor-1 (FGFR1) mRNA expression in adipose tissue. SCI also reduced serum levels and adipose tissue mRNA expression of adiponectin and leptin, two major adipokines. In addition, SCI suppressed hepatic type 2 adiponectin receptor (AdipoR2) mRNA expression and PPAR alpha activation in the liver. Post-SCI mice fed a HFD had further suppression of serum FGF21 levels and hepatic FGF21 expression. Elevated serum free fatty acid (FFA) levels after HFD feeding were observed in post-SCI mice but not in sham-mice, suggesting defective FFA uptake after SCI. Moreover, after SCI several genes that are implicated in insulin's action had reduced expression in tissues of interest. These findings suggest that downregulated FGF21/adiponectin signaling and impaired responsiveness of adipose tissues to FGF21 may, at least in part, contribute to the overall picture of metabolic dysfunction after SCI.

AB  - Fatty acid binding protein 4 (FABP4) has been associated with insulin resistance. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) impairs fetal insulin sensitivity. Female newborns are more insulin resistant than male newborns. We sought to evaluate the association between GDM and cord blood FABP4, and explore potential sex dimorphic associations and the roles of sex hormones. This was a nested case-control study in the Shanghai Birth Cohort, including 153 pairs of newborns in GDM vs. euglycemic pregnancies matched by infant sex and gestational age at delivery. Cord plasma FABP4, leptin, total and high-molecular-weight adiponectin, testosterone and estradiol concentrations were measured. Adjusting for maternal and neonatal characteristics, cord plasma FABP4 (Mean +/- SD: 27.0 +/- 19.6 vs. 18.8 +/- 9.6 ng/mL, P=0.045) and estradiol (52.0 +/- 28.6 vs. 44.2 +/- 26.6, ng/mL, P=0.005) concentrations were higher comparing GDM vs. euglycemic pregnancies in males, but similar in females (all P>0.5). Mediation analyses showed that the positive association between GDM and cord plasma FABP4 in males could be partly mediated by estradiol (P=0.03), but not by testosterone (P=0.72). Cord plasma FABP4 was positively correlated with total adiponectin in females (r=0.17, P=0.053), but the correlation was in the opposite direction in males (r=-0.11, P=0.16) (test for difference in r, P=0.02). Cord plasma FABP4 was not correlated with leptin in both sexes. The study is the first to demonstrate sex-dimorphic associations between GDM and cord plasma FABP4 or estradiol, and between FABP4 and adiponectin in newborns. GDM may affect fetal circulating FABP4 and estradiol levels in males only. Copyright © 2021 Liu, Zheng, Xu, Yang, Wang, Huang, Zhang, Guo, Zhang, Ouyang, Li and Luo.

AB  - Objective Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is characterised by the overproduction of autoantibodies such as rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody. T follicular helper (Tfh) cells are a specialised Th subset that provides signals to B cells, promoting the secretion of antibodies. Our previous studies showed that the frequency of circulating Tfh cells were markedly increased in RA patients and positively correlated with disease activity and the levels of anti-CCP autoantibody. Adiponectin (AD) is an adipokine secreted mainly by adipocytes. Our previous work has demonstrated that AD is highly expressed in the inflamed synovial joint tissue and correlates closely with progressive bone erosion in RA patients. However, it remains unknown whether AD aggravates the severity of RA via modulating Tfh cells. This study aims to investigate whether AD exerts effect on Tfh cells in RA. Methods CD4(+) T cells were purified from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy controls (HC), and adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) expression on the surface of CD4(+)CXCR5(+)PD-1(+) (Tfh) cells was detected by flow cytometry. Purified HC CD4(+) T cells were cultured with different concentration fetal bovine serun (FBS) in the presence or absence of AD. The percentages of Tfh cells were analysed by flow cytometry. RA or osteoarthritis (OA) fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) were stimulated with AD for 72h and then co-cultured with HC CD4(+) T cells through cell-to-cell contact or in a transwell system. The percentages of Tfh cells were analysed by flow cytometry and the levels of soluble factors such as interleukin-(IL)-6, IL-21, IL-12 and IFN. in the supernatants were determined by Human Magnetic Bead Panel or Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Then anti-IL-6 antibody and/or anti-IL-21 antibody was added to the co-culture system, and the percentages of Tfh cells were analysed by flow cytometry. The frequency of Tfh cells in the joint tissue of collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice was examined by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression of Tfh cell transcription factors and functional molecules such as B-cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl-6), B lymphocyte maturation protein 1 (Blimp-1), IL-6, IL-21, IL-12 and IFN. in the joints of CIA mice were detected by real time PCR (RT-PCR). Results Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) expression was detected on the surface of Tfh cells. However, in the present study, we did not find that AD has a direct effect on Tfh cell generation in vitro. Nonetheless, AD-stimulated RA FLSs could promote Tfh cell generation, predominantly via IL-6 production and this upregulated effect was partially abolished upon neutralising IL-6. Finally, intraarticular injection of AD aggravated synovial inflammation with increased frequency of Tfh cells in the joints of AD-treated CIA mice. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that AD-stimulated RA FLSs promote Tfh cell generation, which is mainly mediated by the secretion of soluble factor IL-6. This finding reveals a novel mechanism for AD in RA pathogenesis.

AB  - The aims of this study were to clarify the metabonome alteration in fetal rats after prenatal caffeine ingestion and to explore the underlying mechanism pertaining to the increased fetal circulatory glucocorticoid (GC). Pregnant Wistar rats were daily intragastrically administered with different doses of caffeine (0, 20, 60 and 180 mg/kg) from gestational days (GD) 11 to 20. Metabonome of fetal plasma and amniotic fluid on GD20 were analyzed by H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabonomics. Gene and protein expressions involved in the GC metabolism, glucose and lipid metabolic pathways in fetal liver and gastrocnemius were measured by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. Fetal plasma metabonome were significantly altered by caffeine, which presents as the elevated alpha- and beta-glucose, reduced multiple lipid contents, varied apolipoprotein contents and increased levels of a number of amino acids. The metabonome of amniotic fluids showed a similar change as that in fetal plasma. Furthermore, the expressions of 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11 beta-HSD-2) were decreased, while the level of blood GC and the expressions of 11 beta-HSD-1 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) were increased in fetal liver and gastrocnemius. Meanwhile, the expressions of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), IGF-1 receptor and insulin receptor were decreased, while the expressions of adiponectin receptor 2, leptin receptors and AMP-activated protein kinase alpha 2 were increased after caffeine treatment. Prenatal caffeine ingestion characteristically change the fetal metabonome, which is probably attributed to the alterations of glucose and lipid metabolic pathways induced by increased circulatory GC, activated GC metabolism and enhanced GR expression in peripheral metabolic tissues.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Physiological insulin resistance occurs in normal pregnancy and is exaggerated in women with preeclampsia (PE). Adiponectin is a hormone with insulin-sensitizing, anti-atherogenic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Reports published on association between adiponectin levels and PE risk have been conflicting. This study sought to better determine the circulating adiponectin levels and its mRNA expression in adipose tissue in women with PE., METHODS: This report includes a cross-sectional study at a Chinese clinical research center and meta-analysis. The cross-sectional study included normal pregnancy women (n = 28) and PE women (n = 20) who underwent cesarean operation. Adiponectin concentrations in maternal serum, cord blood, and colostrums were determined by ELISA. Adiponectin mRNA expression levels in adipose tissue were measured by quantitative real-time PCR. Meta-analysis was done on 13 studies, including 302 PE women and 385 normal pregnancy women., RESULTS: In comparison with controls, PE women had higher serum adiponectin concentrations in maternal blood and breast milk, but lower adiponectin concentration in cord blood. Adiponectin mRNA expression in the subcutaneous (Sc) and omental adipose tissues (OM) did not differ between the two groups of women. Meta-analysis confirms that the circulating adiponectin levels were elevated in PE women (p < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: PE women had a higher adiponectin concentration in the maternal blood as well as breast milk but lower adiponectin concentration in umbilical cord blood when compared to women with normal pregnancy. The elevated circulating adiponectin levels in PE women are probably because of a reduced degradation/elimination rather than an increased synthesis of this hormone.

AB  - We used cytokine protein array to analyze the expression of cytokines from human cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells (CB-MSCs). Several cytokines, interleukins (IL), and growth factors, including ENA-78, GM-CSF, GRO, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, OSM, VEGF, FGF-4, FGF-7, FGF-9, GCP-2, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, IGFBP-3, IGFBP-4, IP-10, LIF, MIF, MIP-3alpha, osteoprotegerin, PARC, PIGF, TGF-beta2, TGF-beta3, TIMP-1, as well as TIMP-2, were secreted by CB-MSCs, while IL-4, IL-5, IL-7, IL-13, TGF-beta1, TNF-alpha, and TNF-beta were not expressed under normal growth conditions. IL-6, IL-8, TIMP-1, and TIMP-2 were the most abundant interleukins expressed by CB-MSCs. A set of growth factors were selected to evaluate their stimulatory effects on the IL6 secretion for CB-MSCs. IL-1beta was the most important factor inducing CB-MSC to secret IL-6. The mechanism by which IL-1beta promoted IL-6 expression in CB-MSCs was studied. By using various inhibitors of signal transduction, we found that activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) and MAPK kinase (MEK) is essential in the IL-1beta stimulated signaling cascade which leads to the increase in IL-6 synthesis. Additionally, continuous supplement of IL-1beta in the CB-MSCs culture will facilitate adipogenic maturation of CB-MSCs as evidenced by the presence of oil drops in the CB-MSCs and secretion of leptin, a molecule marker of adipocytes. These results strongly suggest that cytokine induction and signal transduction are important for the differentiation of CB-MSCs.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between the leptin level and neonatal weight and the expression of leptin in placenta., METHODS: The concentrations of leptin in 100 maternal blood and umbilical blood of the term pregnant women were examined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). According to the neonatal weight to divide into the large for gestational age (LGA) group 19 cases, the appropriate for gestational age (AGA) group 65 cases, the small for gestational age (SGA) 16 cases. The level of leptin mRNA in 41 placental tissue was examined by Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., RESULTS: (1) The expression level of leptin mRNA in placenta was 0.97 +/- 0.04, which was positively related to the neonatal weight significantly (r = 0.43, P < 0.01). The expression level of the LGA group (1.01 +/- 0.03) was significantly higher than the AGA group (0.97 +/- 0.02), (P < 0.01). The expression level of the SGA group (0.93 +/- 0.03) was significantly lower than AGA group, (P < 0.01). (2) The concentration of leptin in maternal blood was (14.22 +/- 7.66) micrograms/L, which was not related to the neonatal weight (r = 0.11, P > 0.05). (3) The concentration of leptin in umbilical blood was (7.58 +/- 5.15) micrograms/L, which was positively related to the neonatal weight (r = 0.57, P < 0.01). The concentration of leptin of LGA group was significantly higher than that of AGA group, which was (7.40 +/- 4.45) micrograms/L (P < 0.01). The concentration of leptin of SGA group was (2.79 +/- 1.54) micrograms/L, significantly lower than that of AGA group, (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: The level of leptin in umbilical blood and placenta is closely related to the growth state of fetus. The level of leptin in maternal blood is not related to the neonatal weight. The placenta of pregnant woman is an important resource of leptin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate serum leptin levels in normal pregnant women and their babies., METHODS: Immunoradioassay was used to measure the serum levels of leptin in 10 non-pregnant women, 63 pregnant women (31 in the firs, 10 in the second, and 22 in the third trimester), 27 women at delivery, 18 women in the first week after delivery and in 18 newborns' cord serum. Serum leptin levels were correlated with body weight, body mass index (BMI), fasting insulin levels and lipids., RESULTS: Serum insulin, cholesterol, triglyceride were increased since the second trimester during pregnancy. One week after delivery serum insulin but not cholesterol and triglicetride level was decreased to the levels of non-pregnancy. Serum leptin levels were (7.98 +/- 4.42) micrograms/L in non-pregnant women and (7.03 +/- 3.42) micrograms/L in the first trimester. Then the levels were increased to (13.97 +/- 8.03) micrograms/L in second trimester and (14.86 +/- 6.25) micrograms/L in the third trimester, (19.89 +/- 9.66) micrograms/L at the delivery time and returned to (10.86 +/- 9.18) micrograms/L in the first week after delivery, respectively. Cord serum leptin levels of newborns were (8.93 +/- 6.95) micrograms/L. Serum leptin levels in pregnant women were positively correlated with their body weight, BMI, fasting serum insulin and glycerol levels. Cord serum leptin levels was positively correlated with newborn birth weights as well as their insulin levels., CONCLUSIONS: (1) Serum leptin levels increase in the second and third trimester, and may contribute to the inhibition of increased food intake, body weight and body fat. (2) Newborn serum leptin may come from themselves, and the levels were lower than those in their mothers. (3) Birth weight, possibly adiposity, as well as serum insulin positively regulates serum leptin levels in neonates as in adults.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between leptin's quantity in maternal blood, amniotic fluid, umbilical blood and maternal and newborn's weights., METHODS: Levels of leptin in maternal blood, amniotic fluid, and umbilical blood of 34 pregnant women were detected by radioimmunoassay (RIA) method. Results were analyzed by the correlative analysis., RESULTS: (1) Leptin can be detected either from maternal blood or amniotic fluid or umbilical blood. (2) There was an obvious correction between newborn's weight and leptin's quantity of maternal blood (relative coefficient r = 0.53, P < 0.01), amniotic fluid (r = 0.73, P < 0.01) and umbilical blood (r = 0.67, P < 0.01). (3) There was an obvious correction between maternal weight and leptin's quantity of maternal blood (r = 0.61, P < 0.01). (4) There was an obvious correction between leptin's quantity of amniotic fluid and umbilical blood (r = 0.72, P < 0.001). (5) There was not obvious correction between maternal weight and leptin's quantity of amniotic fluid and umbilical blood (r = 0.22, r = 0.18, respectively. P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: It may be of important significance in detection of leptin's quantity in amniotic fluid and maternal blood in pregnant women for predicting the weight and growth of newborns.

AB  - Leptin is produced predominantly by white adipocytes and in adults it regulates both appetite and energy expenditure but its role in the neonate remains to be fully established. The aim of this, the first study of leptin administration to Meishan piglets, was to examine the effects of chronic leptin administration to neonatal pigs on their endocrine profile, growth and development. Six Meishan sows gave birth normally at term and 6 pairs of siblings (n = 12), matched by birth weight and gender (male, n = 6; female, n = 6) were randomly allocated to leptin (L: n = 6) or placebo (P: n = 6) administration groups. Piglets remained with their mother throughout the study and from day 3 to 8 of neonatal life each pig received either 4 microg ml(-1) kg(-1) body weight recombinant human leptin or a saline placebo. Plasma concentrations of key hormones and metabolites were determined in conjunction with messenger RNA (mRNA) for leptin, which was assessed by PCR. Recombinant leptin treatment improved growth performance and promoted skeletal growth in favour of adipose tissue accretion. Circulating plasma leptin concentrations were higher on days 4 and 7 in L pigs. Leptin administration altered the endocrine profile of the neonatal pig, although these changes were not maintained. There were no relationships between plasma leptin and body weight or mRNA leptin abundance, irrespective of treatment. Chronic leptin administration appeared to have a beneficial influence on growth rate and body conformation, which may in part be attributed to alterations in metabolism and nutrient partitioning.

AB  - The respective prevalences of both asthma and obesity have seen a significant rise in the past few decades. Although the association between these 2 conditions has been found in many studies from different areas around the world, the exact mechanisms for how this association arises remains unresolved. Because both asthma and obesity appear to have their beginnings in early childhood, common exposures that predispose individuals to both these conditions may explain how they are associated. These exposures include common genetic predictors, prenatal exposure to specific nutrients and overall maternal nutrition, patterns of colonization of the neonatal and infant gut, birth weight and infant weight gain, sedentary behaviors, and levels of adipokines in early life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin seems to be involved in the regulation of energy balance, although little is known about the epidemiology of leptin with respect to prediction of weight gain and incidence of obesity-related diseases. The dual aim of this study is to document characteristics of leptin after long-term storage, and to describe its relation to body weight, from birth to old age, in an ongoing prospective study., RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: A population-based sample of Swedish women was first examined at the ages of 38 to 60 and re-examined 24 years later. This study used 1358 frozen serum samples that had been stored 29 years for analysis of leptin concentrations and their relation to body weight history., RESULTS: Leptin values obtained from stored samples showed the same correlation with relative weight as that seen in a contemporary sample with similar demographic characteristics. Lower self-reported birth weight was associated with higher leptin levels in adulthood (p = 0.01), controlling for age and adult BMI. Prospective analyses revealed that high leptin in 38 to 46-year-olds predicted subsequent long-term weight gain (p = 0.003), although no significant associations were seen in women initially aged 50 or older., DISCUSSION: It is feasible to use frozen serum for studying leptin in relation to obesity and related developments many years later. High leptin level was a risk factor for subsequent weight gain in 38- and 46-year-old women. Retrospective analyses involving birth weight suggest that leptin resistance in adulthood might have fetal origins.

AB  - An important role in the network of interconnections between the mother and child is played by adipokines, which are adipose tissue hormones engaged in the regulation of metabolism. Alternations of maternal adipokines translate to the worsening of maternal insulin resistance as well as metabolic stress, altered placenta functions, and fetal development, which finally contribute to long-term metabolic unfavorable conditions. This paper is the first to summarize the current state of knowledge concerning the concentrations of individual adipokines in different biological fluids of maternal and cord plasma, newborn/infant plasma, milk, and the placenta, where it highlights the impact of adverse perinatal risk factors, including gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm delivery, and maternal obesity on the adipokine patterns in maternal-infant dyads. The importance of adipokine measurement and relationships in biological fluids during pregnancy and lactation is crucial for public health in the area of prevention of most diet-related metabolic diseases. The review highlights the huge knowledge gap in the field of hormones participating in the energy homeostasis and metabolic pathways during perinatal and postnatal periods in the mother-child dyad. An in-depth characterization is needed to confirm if the adverse outcomes of early developmental programming might be modulated via maternal lifestyle intervention.

AB  - There is clear evidence of placental leptin production, as shown recently in trophoblast cultures and by dual in vitro placenta perfusion (median production of 225 pg/min per g of tissue; 98.4% released into the maternal and 1.6% into the fetal circulation). However, the physiological impact for the mother and the fetus is unclear. The classical role of leptin is to provide information about energy stores to the central nervous system, and to reduce appetite if the energy stores are full. In pregnancy, maternal plasma leptin concentrations are elevated, and lack the well established correlation with body fat energy stores that is observed in non-pregnant women, indicating an alternative function for leptin during pregnancy and fetal development. Maternal and fetal plasma leptin levels are dysregulated in pathological conditions such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation, representing an effect or a cause of disturbances in the feto/placento/maternal unit.

AB  - There is clear evidence that the placenta produces leptin. However, it is still unclear to what extent leptin is released into the maternal and the fetal circulation. The aim of our study was to determine placental leptin release rates into these 2 compartments. In 10 term placentas, using dual in vitro perfusion of an isolated cotyledon, concentrations of leptin, hCG, and human placental lactogen (hPL) were determined in perfusates and in the tissue before and after perfusion. With perfusions lasting 270-840 min, total leptin production was 225 pg/g x min [median; interquartile range (IQR), 76-334 pg/g x min]. The release into the fetal circulation was very low (median, 2.5; IQR, 1.1-5.9 pg/g x min) compared with the release into the maternal circulation (median, 203; IQR, 79-373 pg/g x min) corresponding to 1.6% and 98.4% of net release. Only 0.05% of hPL and hCG were released into the fetal circulation and 99.95% into the maternal circulation, confirming previous results. Release into the fetal circulation correlated significantly with release into the maternal circulation for leptin (r = 0.648; P < 0.05) and hPL (r = 0.721; P < 0.05). Furthermore, release of leptin into the fetal circulation was positively correlated with release of fetal hCG (r = 0.661; P < 0.05). Most of the leptin produced by the placenta is released into the maternal circulation, but compared with other placental hormones (hCG and hPL), a considerably higher proportion of leptin is released into the fetal circulation. These findings may at least partially explain the marked increase in maternal serum leptin levels in pregnancy. The rapid postnatal decrease in leptin levels in both the mother and the neonate is also consistent with the concept of placental origin.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The goals of this study were to examine the influence of maternal type 1 diabetes during pregnancy on offspring adiposity and glucose tolerance at age 7 years and to assess whether metabolic factors at birth (neonatal leptin and insulin) predict adverse outcomes., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined 100 offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes (OT1DM) and 45 offspring of control mothers. Mothers had previously been recruited during pregnancy, and, where possible, birth weight, umbilical cord insulin, and leptin were measured. Children were classed as overweight and obese using age-specific reference ranges., RESULTS: OT1DM had similar height (control, 1.25 +/- 0. 06 m; OT1DM, 1.24 +/- 0.06 m; P = 0.81) but were heavier (control, 25.5 +/- 3.8 kg; OT1DM, 27.1 +/- 5.7 kg; P = 0.048) and had an increased BMI (control, 16.4 kg/m(2); OT1DM, 17.4 +/- 2.6 kg/m(2), P = 0.005). Waist circumference (control, 56.0 +/- 3.7 cm; OT1DM, 58 +/- 6.8 cm; P = 0.02) and sum of skinfolds were increased (control, 37.5 +/- 17.0 mm [n = 42]; OT1DM, 46.1 +/- 24.2 mm [n = 91]; P = 0.02), and there was a marked increase in the prevalence of overweight and obese children (OT1DM, 22% overweight and 12% obese; control, 0% overweight and 7% obese; chi(2) P = 0.001). Glucose tolerance was not different compared with that in control subjects. BMI at age 7 years correlated with cord leptin (OT1DM, r = 0.25; n = 61, P = 0.047), weakly with adjusted birth weight (r = 0.19; P = 0.06) and hematocrit (r = 0.25; n = 50, P = 0.07), but not cord insulin (OT1DM, r = -0.08; P = 0.54)., CONCLUSIONS: OT1DM are at increased risk of overweight and obesity in childhood. This risk appears to relate, in part, to fetal leptin and hematocrit but not insulin.

We have assessed the influence of maternal diabetes on hormones associated with foetal growth and the relationship of these hormones to birthweight., DESIGN: Case-control study., PATIENTS: Singleton offspring of mothers with type 1 diabetes (ODM, n = 140) and control mothers (Control, n = 49)., MEASUREMENTS: Birthweight, cord blood insulin, proinsulin, 32-33 split proinsulin, leptin, IGF-1, IGFBP-3, cortisol., RESULTS: Maternal diabetes was associated with higher birthweight (ODM 3.80 +/- 0.69 kg; Control; 3.56 +/- 0.52 kg, P = 0.02) and marked increases in insulin (median [interquartile range]: ODM 110 [60-217] pmol/l; Control 22 [15-37] pmol/l; P < 0.0001) and leptin (ODM 32 [15-60] ng/ml; Control 9 [4-17] ng/ml; P < 0.0001) but no absolute difference in IGF-1 (ODM 7.9 [6.2-9.8] nmol/l, Control 7.5 [6.2-9.8] nmol/l, P = 0.24) or its principle binding protein IGFBP-3 (ODM 1.63 +/- 0.38 micro g/ml, Control 1.63 +/- 0.28 micro g/ml; P = 0.12). Individually, insulin, insulin propeptides, leptin, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were significantly (P < 0.05) correlated with birthweight (in ODM and Control). IGF-1 and leptin were positively related to birthweight independently of each other and insulin in both ODM and Control. By contrast, insulin showed independent relationships to birthweight in ODM (P < 0.0001) but not in Control (P = 0.4)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal diabetes is associated with marked elevation of insulin and leptin in cord blood of their offspring. Hormonal correlates of birthweight differ between ODM and Control with an independent relationship of insulin to birthweight observed only in ODM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In adults, adiponectin is reduced in association with excess adiposity, type 2 diabetes, and hyperinsulinemia. We assessed whether adiponectin was 1) present in the fetal circulation, 2) altered in the fetal circulation in the presence of maternal diabetes, and 3) had relations to fetal cord blood insulin or adiposity., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We assessed adiponectin in cord blood in a large cohort of singleton offspring of diabetic mothers (ODM; n = 134) and control mothers (n = 45)., RESULTS: Adiponectin was present in cord blood and, in ODM, was higher in those delivered at later gestational ages (Spearman r = 0.18, P = 0.03). Adiponectin was slightly lower in ODM than control subjects (ODM 19.7 +/- 6.1 vs. control 21.8 +/- 5.3 micro g/ml; P = 0.04), although this difference could potentially reflect different gestational ages in the two groups (ODM 37.6 +/- 1.5 and control 40.1 +/- 1.1 weeks). In contrast to adults, adiponectin levels in the fetus were unrelated to the degree of adiposity, blood insulin, or leptin in either control subjects or ODM., CONCLUSIONS: Adiponectin is present in cord blood but does not show expected physiological relations with adiposity as observed in adults.

AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the association of maternal adiponectin with infant birth size in 1349 pregnant women at Uppsala University Hospital, Sweden. The mean age of the women was 31.0 years, and 40.9% were nulliparous. Maternal early mid-pregnancy adiponectin was measured in microgram/mL. Linear regression models were performed to evaluate the association between adiponectin and infant birth weight. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate adiponectin in relation to the odds of giving birth to an infant large-for-gestational-age (LGA, infant birth weight standard deviation score > 90th percentile). Adjustments were made for early pregnancy BMI and diabetes mellitus. Prior adjustments, adiponectin was inversely associated with infant birth weight (beta - 17.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) - 26.8 to - 7.4 g, P < 0.001), and one microgram/mL increase in adiponectin was associated with a 9% decrease in the odds of giving birth to an LGA infant (odds ratio 0.91, CI 0.85-0.97, P = 0.006). The associations did not withstand in the adjusted models. We found a significant interaction between adiponectin and infant sex on birth size. This interaction was driven by an inverse association between maternal adiponectin and birth size in female infants, whereas no such association was found in males. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - To investigate the physiological changes of leptin levels and whether placenta is linked to its production during pregnancy, plasma of 65 pregnant women at various gestational weeks were compared with those of 34 age- and body mass index (BMI)-matched nonpregnant women in the study. The leptin levels showed a gradual increase from 7-13 gestational week, then continuously elevated during weeks 14-20, 21-27, 28-34, virtually reaching a peak at 35-41 weeks' gestation. When they were compared to those of age- and BMI-matched nonpregnant women, a significant (P < 0.0001) increase was found with every gestational week. There were positive correlations between maternal leptin and BMI of first (7-13th week), second (14-27th week) and third (28-41st week) trimesters, with the correlation coefficients of 0.40 (P < 0.05), 0.54 (P < 0.001), and 0.49 (P < 0.001), respectively. No correlation (r = -0.17, P > 0.05, n = 31) was found between maternal leptin level and the neonatal birth weight. These data suggest that placental production of leptin is one major source of higher levels in maternal circulating leptin other than maternal gain of fat mass and that maternal leptin level is not related to fetal birth weight during pregnancy.

AB  - To investigate the physiological significance of umbilical plasma leptin in the fetal growth and its possible origin of production during pregnancy, plasma leptin concentrations in venous and arterial cord bloods were measured in 42 neonates (male = 23, female = 19, gestational age 36-41 weeks, birth weight 2600-4000 g). Leptin concentrations in umbilical veins (5.65 +/- 0.53 ng/mL, n = 42) and umbilical arteries (0.56 +/- 0.07 ng/mL, n = 42) were significantly (P < 0.001) lower than those in maternal peripheral veins (22.36 +/- 1.06 ng/mL, n = 42). Mean plasma leptin concentration (+/- SEM) in venous cord blood was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than that of arterial cord blood. There was significantly positive correlation (r = 0.447, P < 0.01) between umbilical venous leptin levels and neonatal body mass index (BMI). A positive correlation (r = 0.435, P < 0.01) was also found between umbilical arterial leptin and neonate BMI. There was no positive correlation between umbilical leptin levels in venous cord blood and placental weight. We thus conclude that umbilical plasma leptin may play an essential role in the fetal growth and metabolism during pregnancy and placenta is one of the major sources of leptin production, but the level of leptin in umbilico-placental circulation is independent of the weight of placenta.

AB  - We evaluated possible mediators underlying lifestyle intervention effects on neonatal adiposity, assessed with sum of skinfolds and cord blood leptin. This is a secondary analysis of the DALI study, a randomised controlled trial in nine European countries. Pregnant women with a pre-pregnancy body mass index of >=29 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to counselling for healthy eating (HE), physical activity (PA), HE&PA combined, or to usual care. We considered five maternal metabolic factors at 24-28 and 35-37 weeks of gestation, and four cord blood factors as possible mediators of the effect of combined HE&PA counselling on neonatal adiposity. From all potential mediators, the intervention only affected cord blood non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA), which was higher in the HE&PA group compared to UC (0.068 (mmol/L), 95% CI: 0.004 to 0.133). Cord blood NEFA did not mediate the HE&PA intervention effects on neonatal sum of skinfolds or cord blood leptin, based on an indirect effect on skinfolds of 0.018 (mm), 95% CI: -0.217 to 0.253 and an indirect effect on leptin of -0.143 (mug/l), 95% CI: -0.560 to 0.273. The Dali study observed reductions in neonatal adiposity in pregnant women with obesity, but we were not able to identify the underlying metabolic pathway. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUNDIn contrast to overt diabetes mellitus (DM), gestational DM (GDM) is defined as impaired glucose tolerance induced by pregnancy, which may arise from exaggerated physiologic changes in glucose metabolism. GDM prevalence is reported to be as high as 20% among pregnancies depending on the screening method, gestational age, and the population studied. Maternal and fetal effects of uncontrolled GDM include stillbirth, macrosomia, neonatal diabetes, birth trauma, and subsequent postpartum hemorrhage. Therefore, it is essential to find the potential target population and associated predictive and preventive measures for future intensive peripartum care.AIMTo review studies that explored the cellular and molecular mechanisms of GDM as well as predictive measures and prevention strategies.METHODSThe search was performed in the Medline and PubMed databases using the terms "gestational diabetes mellitus," "overt diabetes mellitus," and "insulin resistance." In the literature, only full-text articles were considered for inclusion (237 articles). Furthermore, articles published before 1997 and duplicate articles were excluded. After a final review by two experts, all studies (1997-2023) included in the review met the search terms and search strategy (identification from the database, screening of the studies, selection of potential articles, and final inclusion).RESULTSFinally, a total of 79 articles were collected for review. Reported risk factors for GDM included maternal obesity or overweight, pre-existing DM, and polycystic ovary syndrome. The pathophysiology of GDM involves genetic variants responsible for insulin secretion and glycemic control, pancreatic beta cell depletion or dysfunction, aggravated insulin resistance due to failure in the plasma membrane translocation of glucose transporter 4, and the effects of chronic, low-grade inflammation. Currently, many antepartum measurements including adipokines (leptin), body mass ratio (waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio], and biomarkers (microRNA in extracellular vesicles) have been studied and confirmed to be useful markers for predicting GDM. For preventing GDM, physical activity and dietary approaches are effective interventions to control body weight, improve glycemic control, and reduce insulin resistance.CONCLUSIONThis review explored the possible factors that influence GDM and the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms of GDM and provided predictive measures and prevention strategies based on results of clinical studies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal hypercholesterolaemia during pregnancy increases lipid peroxidation in mothers and fetuses and programs increased susceptibility to atherosclerosis later in life. The objective of this study was to elucidate the role of the placenta in mediating oxidative stress from mother to offspring., DESIGN: Comparison between normo- and hypercholesterolaemic mothers (n = 36 each) and their children., SETTING: Obstetric wards, hospitals of the University of Naples and Regione Campania., POPULATION: Healthy primiparas delivering by caesarean section., METHODS: Biochemical measurements of oxidative stress and serum leptin in cord plasma and placenta, immunochemistry of placenta microvessels, and vasoreactivity studies were performed., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Oxidative status (i.e. lipid composition and content of oxidised fatty acids, activity of pro- and antioxidant enzymes, immunohistochemical presence of oxidation-specific epitopes) in maternal and cord blood and in placental tissue, as well as vascular reactivity in omental arteries., RESULTS: Hypercholesterolaemia during pregnancy was associated with extensive changes in fatty acid composition of both maternal and cord blood lipids, sufficient to alter vasoreactivity of omental vessels. Results also indicated that the placenta is not only subject to substantial oxidative stress, but that it may further increase fetal oxidative stress through changes of pro- and antioxidant enzyme activities., CONCLUSIONS: The placenta plays an important role in both transmitting and enhancing pathogenic effects of gestational hypercholesterolaemia.

AB  - The present study aimed to explore the association between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and Chemerin, by analysing Chemerin level, clinical data and biochemical parameters among 46 GDM patients and 43 controls. It was found that the Chemerin levels from cord blood, peripheral blood, adipose tissue and placenta tissue were all significantly higher in the GDM group than those in the control group (p < .05 for all). Maternal insulin resistance (IR) index and serum inflammation parameters, including C-reactive protein and white blood cells, were also higher in GDM group (p < .05 for all). Moreover, maternal IR index and circulating insulin level were both positively correlated with maternal circulating Chemerin level (p < .05 for both). Our findings suggest that Chemerin, associated with IR and more expressed in GDM women, might participate in the pathogenesis of GDM. Impact Statement What is already known on this subject: Chemerin, a recently-discovered adipocytokine, has been widely-considered to be involved in metabolic diseases, and several studies have investigated it in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but with no consensus about the level comparison between GDM and controls. What the results of this study add: The present case-control study found that the levels of Chemerin from cord blood, peripheral blood, adipose tissue and placenta tissue were all significantly higher in the GDM group. What the implications are of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research: Also, the circulating Chemerin level was positively correlated with insulin index, which we thought would add to the evidence that Chemerin does be associated with GDM, contributing to elucidating the pathogenesis of GDM.

AB  - Background: Maternal exogenous docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-rich n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) intake during the pregnancy, especially DHA, has inconsistent effects on reducing the fat storage of the infants in different clinical studies. Objective(s): We sought to determine the effects of maternal exogenous DHA-rich n-3 PUFAs capsule intake from the different pregnancy periods on the weight gain of their infants through modifying the DNA methylation status of obesity-associated genes in the umbilical cord blood. Design(s): A prospective 3-year follow-up study after the pregnancy was enrolled in this cohort from May to October 2016. They were divided into different groups according to the initial time of exogenous DHA capsule intake through the questionnaires (S1 - early trimester, S2 - mid-trimester, S3 - late trimester, and control - without). The concentrations and compositions of DHA were determined by gas chromatography. We applied quantitative DNA methylation states of the obesity-associated genes in the umbilical cord blood. The growth outcomes and relevant Z-scores were recorded at birth and 1 and 2 years. The correlations between DNA methylation status of the obesity-associated genes with the consents of DNA and body mass index (BMI) values were investigated as the measures. Result(s): In total, 205 pregnant women and their infants were eligible for this follow-up study. The concentrations and compositions of DHA in the colostrum and umbilical cord blood were higher in the S1 and S2 groups than those in the control and S3 groups as well as the decreased weight, BMI, weight for age Z-score (WAZ) and BMI for age Z-score (BMI Z) at birth and 1 and/or 2 years, and higher levels of global DNA methylation and many CpG sites in the obesity-associated genes, such as CpG2, CpG9, CpG11, and CpG16 of PPAR-gamma; CpG2,3, CpG4-6, CpG8, CpG9,10, CpG11, CpG15,16, and average of CCAAT/enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP-alpha); CpG1 and average of adiponectin; CpG1, CpG2, CpG3, CpG5, CpG6, CpG7, and average of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2); CpG6, CpG7, CpG9, CpG16, CpG23, and CpG24 of leptin, which were more obvious in the S1 group when compared with those in the S2 group. These above hypermethylation levels of CpG sites were negatively correlated with the BMI and positively related with the changes of DHA in the colostrum and umbilical cord blood. Conclusion(s): Maternal exogenous DHA-rich n-3 PUFAs intake from early-and mid-trimesters of the pregnancy may avoid the development of obesity among Chinese Han infants until 2 years by modulating DNA methylation states of obesity-associated genes, which could provide attractive targets for prenatal prevention of the metabolic disorders.Copyright © 2021 Ping Li et al.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes can alter the trajectory of fetal development, but there are few studies on the effects of abnormal lipid metabolism on physical development of infants. We aimed to explore the prevalence of maternal dyslipidemia, its influencing factors and effects on the physical development of fetuses and infants, as well as the role of leptin in this process., METHODS: Questionnaire surveys and main outcome measures were administered among 338 pairs of pregnant women and newborns., RESULTS: The detection rate of maternal dyslipidemia was 31.5%. The median levels of TG (triglyceride) and TG/HDL (high-density lipoprotein) ratio were higher in large-for-gestational-age (LGA) newborns. Birth weight was positively related to infants' height and weight at six months and one year old (p < 0.05). Leptin was positively related to TG levels of pregnant women and newborns' birth weight (p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that having greater than or equal to four meals a day (OR = 6.552, 95%CI = 1.014-42.338) and liking to eat lightly flavored food during pregnancy (OR = 1.887, 95%CI = 1.048-3.395) were independent risk factors of maternal dyslipidemia., CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of dyslipidemia was relatively high in pregnant women and was affected by dietary behaviors. Abnormal lipid levels during pregnancy could affect weight and length at birth, which might be associated with increasing leptin levels in cord blood, and then the weight of infants would be influenced by birth weight.

AB  - Background Adipocytokines may play a role in fetal programming of neurodevelopment. We aimed to investigate the associations between cord blood adipocytokine concentrations and children's intelligence test scores. Methods We used data from two ongoing pregnancy cohorts in North America: the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC, n = 429) and Health Outcomes and Measures of the Environment (HOME, n = 183) Studies. Umbilical cord blood adipocytokine concentrations were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. We assessed children's Intelligence Quotient (IQ) and its components using the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence-III or Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-IV. We used linear regression and linear mixed models to estimate associations between log2-transformed adipocytokine concentrations and children's IQ after adjusting for sociodemographic, perinatal, and child factors. Results After adjusting for covariates, cord blood adiponectin was positively associated with children's full-scale IQ scores at age 3 years in the MIREC Study (beta = 1.4, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.2, 2.5) and at ages 5 and 8 years in the HOME Study (beta = 1.7, CI: -0.1, 3.5). Adiponectin was positively associated with performance IQ in both studies (MIREC: beta = 2.0, CI: 0.7, 3.3; HOME: beta = 2.2, CI: 0.5, 3.9). Adiponectin was positively associated with working memory composite scores at age 8 in the HOME Study (beta = 3.1, CI: 1.0, 5.2). Leptin was not associated with children's IQ in either study. Conclusions Cord blood adiponectin was associated with higher full-scale and performance IQ and working memory composite scores in children. Future studies are needed to explore the mechanisms underlying these associations. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Higher leptin and lower adiponectin correlate with adult and childhood adiposity, but it is unclear how exposure to these adipokines during gestation relates to offspring growth. We aimed to investigate the relationships of maternal and cord adipokines with offspring adiposity across childhood to early adolescence, as well as interactions with child age., METHODS: In mother-child pairs in the Project Viva cohort, we measured adipokines in mothers at second trimester (n=1106) and in cord blood at birth (n=657). We measured offspring adiposity indices at early childhood (mean 3.3+/-s.d. 0.3 years), mid-childhood (7.9+/-0.8 years) and early adolescence (13.2+/-0.9 years). We analyzed associations of maternal and cord adipokines with offspring longitudinal adiposity using a linear mixed model adjusting for pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), gestational weight gain (GWG), and other confounders., RESULTS: Mothers with higher BMI and GWG had higher leptin. Offspring born to mothers with the highest vs lowest quartile of leptin had lower BMI z-score (-0.49 units, 95% confidence interval (CI):-0.72,-0.26), waist circumference (-2.6 cm, 95% CI: -3.7,-1.5) and sum of subscapular and triceps skinfolds (-2.8 mm, 95% CI: -4.1,-1.4) in early life. An interaction term between maternal leptin and child age was positive, suggesting that the associations between maternal leptin and child adiposity were not constant over time. Offspring born to mothers with lowest vs highest quartile of maternal adiponectin had lower early life adiposity (BMI z-score -0.27 units, 95% CI: -0.48,-0.05). Results were similar for cord leptin but not cord adiponectin., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings showed higher maternal and cord leptin, and lower maternal adiponectin are associated with lower offspring adiposity from childhood to early adolescence, independent of maternal BMI and GWG. However, the strength of these associations was not constant over time.

AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) generally occurs in adults. Adults with T2DM show hyperglycemia resulting from decreased insulin sensitivity and loss of beta cells. Chronic hyperglycemia induces dysfunction in organs such as kidney, eye, neuron and heart. Both T2DM and obesity are chronic metabolic diseases characterized by insulin resistance induced by proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines. Traditional therapies for DM such as those using diets and drugs fail to maintain normal blood glucose levels all the time, and because of the scarcity of donors, the opportunity for the replacement of beta cells by islet or pancreas transplantation is limited. Stem cell therapies could likely become an effective approach for T2DM treatment; stem cells including embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, bone marrow stem cells, and mesenchymal stem cells isolated from various tissues such as bone marrow, adipose tissue and umbilical cord blood. Oxidative stress causes a complex dysregulation of cell metabolism, and more particularly induces insulin resistance and beta cell dysfunction. Heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) shows anti-oxidant effects and benefits for T2DM. In this review, we summarize the relationship between T2DM and obesity, insulin resistance and HO-1, and stem cell therapies for T2DM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)+45T/G of adiponectin gene with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and neonate birth weight., METHODS: A total of 264 GDM and 272 pregnant women with normal glucose (NG) were enrolled. DNA was successfully extracted from peripheral blood leucocyte samples. And SNPs+45T/G of adiponectin gene were examined. We also analyzed differences in the genotypic distribution and allelic frequencies in SNP+45T/G of adiponectin gene among GDM group with different neonate birth weights., RESULTS: There was no significant difference between two groups with respects to SNP +45T/G polymorphisms of adiponectin gene (P > 0.05). But significant genotypic difference existed in SNP+45T/G among three GDM groups with different birth weights. Frequencies of T allele were significantly higher in the GDM group with higher birth weight, 68.75% in GDM group with macrosomia and 72.86% in GDM group with 3000-4000 g birth weight (both P < 0.01). And there was no significant difference in SNP +45T/G polymorphisms of adiponectin gene between GDM women and NG group with macrosomia., CONCLUSION: SNP +45T/G polymorphisms of adiponectin gene are not associated with GDM. However, SNP+45T/G polymorphisms of adiponectin gene of GDM women are closely associated with neonate birth weigh. The G/T polymorphisms of SNP+45 of adiponectin are not obviously associated with a higher occurrence of macrosomia in GDM women.

AB  - This study investigated the expression profile of placental leptin and leptin receptor isoforms in preeclampsia, using placental tissue from normal pregnancies that were matched in gestational age and birth weight as controls. A total of 29 cases of preeclampsia were studied by immunohistochemistry, including 16 severe and 13 mild preeclampsia cases. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was further performed using RNA extracted from frozen tissue (10 severe preeclampsia, 10 mild preeclampsia, and 20 normal third trimester placentas). In all tissue sections, immunostaining signal was shown in the cytoplasmic compartment of the trophoblastic cells. Both the severe and mild preeclampsia groups showed significantly higher immunostaining for leptin compared with normal controls (p < 0.05), but there was no significant difference between the severe and mild preeclampsia groups (p > 0.05). There was no significant difference in immunostaining for leptin receptor between both severe and mild preeclampsia compared with controls (p > 0.05). RT-PCR showed significantly higher levels of mRNA transcripts of leptin in severe preeclampsia (p < 0.05), but not mild preeclampsia (p > 0.05), compared with normal controls. No significant difference in expression of all the receptor isoforms was demonstrated between both severe and mild preeclampsia groups compared with controls (p > 0.05). In conclusion, we confirmed an up-regulated expression of leptin in placental tissue in preeclampsia. However, there was no difference in the expression of all leptin receptor isoforms in placental tissue between preeclamptic and normal pregnancies. The leptin signal probably does not play a major primary role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review recent information leading to a better understanding of the endocrinology of male puberty, including information from earlier stages of life., RECENT FINDINGS: Differences in relative levels of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in the neonatal period have been further described, as well as changes in inhibin B and anti-Mullerian hormone levels. Studies among men with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism suggest a role for the 'minipuberty of infancy' in inhibin B levels. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog-stimulated LH levels at the age of puberty may be useful in diagnosing hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Inhibin B levels are likewise useful in monitoring spermatogenic activity., SUMMARY: Data from fetal life (men born small for gestational age with evidence of a defect in steroidogenesis, relatively high LH:FSH ratio among very premature boys), neonatal period (attenuated rise of inhibin B after rFSH stimulation among men with congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism), and puberty (often demonstrable by LH levels alone, progressive rise of insulin-like factor 3 levels, and decrease of anti-Mullerian hormone levels as a consequence of FSH and LH stimulation), all enhance the understanding of the physiology of puberty.

AB  - Hypertrehalosemic hormone (HTH) is a neuropeptide in the adipokinetic hormone/red pigment-concentrating hormone (AKH/RPCH) family that stimulates the synthesis of trehalose, the main blood sugar of many insects. The preproHTH of the cockroach Blaberus discoidalis was cloned from the corpora cardiaca (CC), the endocrine source for HTH, and the deduced sequence and organization of preproHTH were compared with other AKH/RPCH precursors. PreproHTH mRNA was determined to be similar to 0.5 kb in length as predicted by DNA. sequence analysis. Northern blot analysis of the CC, ventral nerve cord, brain and fat body detected HTH-mRNA only in the CC. Levels of the HTH transcript in the CC were determined according to age, gender and mating. The HTH message was most abundant in the CC during the first several days of adult life in both sexes, then declined by 50% and were stable. HTH-mRNA levels in the CC did not respond to mating.

AB  - Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are at increased risk of future glucose intolerance and type 2 diabetes, possibly after due intrauterine metabolic programming. Soluble leptin receptor (SLR) limits leptin access to signal-transducing membrane receptors. The present study examines whether SGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) twins differ with regard to their C-peptide, glucose and leptin systems. The markers C-peptide, glucose, fetal leptin, and SLR in cord blood were assessed in children from dichorionic twin pregnancies at delivery. In 32 cases, weight differed by >15% between twins: one demonstrated Intrauterine Growth Retardation (IUGR) (<10th percentile-SGA), while the other did not (AGAI). The other 67 pairs presented appropriate weight for gestational age (AGAII). Placental leptin and placental leptin receptor content were also assessed. Despite the same concentrations of glucose, the SGA twins maintained a higher level of C-peptide [44.48 pmol/l vs. 20.91 pmol/l, p < 0.05] than the AGAI co-twins, higher HOMA index, calculated as [C-peptide] x [Glucose] (p = 0.045), in cord blood, and a higher level of SLR [SGA vs AGAI-mean: 28.63 ng/ml vs. 19.91 ng/ml, p < 0.01], without any differences in total leptin (p = 0.37). However, SGA placentas demonstrated higher leptin level [130.1 pg/100 g total protein vs 83.8 pg/100 g total protein, p = 0.03], without differences in placental leptin receptor (p = 0.66). SGA/IUGR twins demonstrate relative insulin resistance accompanied by decreased fetal and increased placental leptin signaling. We speculate that relative insulin resistance and changes in the leptin system might be the first evidence of processes promoting deleterious metabolic programming for post-natal life.

AB  - The metabolic and cardiovascular complications associated with in-utero undernutrition have been identified during the past 10 years. Reduced fetal growth is independently associated with an increased risk of development of cardiovascular diseases, the insulin-resistance syndrome or one of its components (i.e., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes). Insulin resistance appears to be a key component underlying these metabolic complications. Although the mechanism remains unclear, several pieces of evidence support an active role of adipose tissue in the emergence of insulin resistance (an abnormal growth pattern and repartition, hypersensitivity to catecholamines, regulation of leptin and adiponectin secretion and modulation of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma). Among individuals born SGA, those who are more at risk of gaining excess adiposity are those who are thin at birth following a period of fetal growth restriction. This period of undernutrition is followed by a neonatal period of catch-up growth and renutrition. This pattern induces important modifications in adipose tissue, with long-term consequences, among which is a high risk of early development of insulin resistance. Not all individuals born SGA will show such modifications in adipose tissue, meaning that not all of those born SGA are at risk of insulin resistance and diabetes. From a broader point of view, several hypotheses have been proposed over the past 10 years to explain this unexpected association between being born SGA and the later development of disease. Each of them points to a detrimental fetal environment, to a genetic susceptibility or to interactions between these two components playing a critical role in this context. Although not confirmed, the hypothesis suggesting that this association could be the consequence of genetic/environmental interactions remains the most attractive. Copyright 2006 S.

AB  - Leptin a regulator of body weight is involved in reproductive and developmental functions. Leptin promoter DNA methylation (LEP) regulates gene expression in a tissue-specific manner and has been linked to adverse pregnancy outcomes. In non-pathologic human pregnancies, we assessed LEP methylation, genotyped the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs2167270 in placental (n=81), maternal and cord blood samples (n=60), and examined the association between methylation, genotype, and perinatal factors. Maternal blood LEP methylation was lower in pre-pregnancy obese women (P=0.01). Cord blood LEP methylation was higher in small for gestational age (SGA) (P=4.6x10(-3)) and A/A genotype (P=1.6x10(-4)), lower (-1.47, P=0.03) in infants born to pre-pregnancy obese mothers and correlated (P=0.01) with maternal blood LEP. Gender was associated with placental LEP methylation (P=0.05). These results suggest that LEP epigenetic control may be influenced by perinatal factors including: maternal obesity, infant growth, genotype and gender in a tissue-specific manner and may have multigenerational implications.

AB  - To investigate placental leptin production in placental insufficiency, placental leptin production was measured in women with severe preeclampsia (group 1) and in normotensive pregnancies associated with intrauterine growth restriction (group 2), compared to controls (group 3). Placental leptin content was increased 3-fold in group 1 compared to group 2 (192.5.1 +/- 39.5 vs. 67.8 +/- 10.6 ng/g) and 8-fold in group 1 compared to group 3 (192.5.1 +/- 39.5 vs. 25.4 +/- 6.9 ng/g). Placental leptin content was positively correlated with maternal leptin/BMI ratio (r = 0.62) and the resistance index of the umbilical artery (r = 0.60). These data demonstrate that placental insufficiency is associated with a dramatic increase in placental leptin production. This results in a rise in maternal leptinemia that may be taken as an early index of placental dysfunction. Copyright 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin, the protein encoded by the Ob gene in the adipose cell, is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. This review describes recent findings regarding the putative functions of leptin during pregnancy., MATERIAL: and methods. We searched the literature consulting Medline database., RESULTS: Placental leptin production makes a substantial contribution to maternal circulating levels during pregnancy. Leptin has been detected in fetal plasma as early as week 18 of gestation, and umbilical leptin concentrations are closely related to birth weight. This has led to the hypothesis that fetal fat mass mainly determines fetal circulating leptin. Placental leptin production is increased in choriocarcinoma, preeclampsia and type 1 diabetes. Estrogens, hypoxia and insulin have been suggested as positive regulators of placental leptin production., CONCLUSION: Maternal leptinemia might act as a sensor of energy balance during pregnancy. The presence of both leptin and leptin receptors in the placenta suggests that leptin can act by autocrine or endocrine pathways in the human placenta. The roles of fetal leptin and consequences of increased placental leptin production in pathological pregnancies have yet to be elucidated.

AB  - In the adult, circulating leptin is highly correlated to adipose tissue mass. Whether such a relationship exists prenatally is unknown, because the actual source of fetal leptin has not been determined. In the present study, we have assessed the placental contribution to fetal and maternal circulating leptin concentrations and determined whether fetal adipose tissue produces leptin. The rate of leptin production in dually perfused human placenta was 0.036 ng/min.g. Ninety-five percent of the leptin released was delivered into the maternal circulation, vs. only 5% on the fetal side. Leptin messenger RNA and protein were detected in adipose tissue biopsies of 20-38 week human fetuses. However, leptin concentration was twice lower in fetal (0.22 +/- 0.11 ng/mg protein, n = 6) than in adult (0.49 +/- 0.12 ng/mg protein, n = 8) adipose tissue. Umbilical leptin levels closely reflected ponderal index at birth over a wide range of birth weights (1.6--4.1 kg). In sharp contrast, maternal and placental leptin concentrations were increased in pregnancies associated with fetal growth retardation. We conclude that umbilical leptin levels are independent of placental leptin production and can be taken as a marker of fat mass in human fetuses. By contrast, placental leptin production makes a substantial contribution to maternal circulating leptin levels during pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the frequency of macrosomia in an homogeneous cohort of type 1 diabetic mothers and to analyze the influence of maternal factors and glycemic control on the incidence of fetal macrosomia., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifty-five consecutive type 1 diabetic first-pregnancies were prospectively studied. Macrosomia was defined by a ponderal index above the 90(th) percentile. Venous cord blood levels of insulin, C peptide and leptin were measured at delivery. The influence of HbA1c levels and other maternal variables on the occurrence of macrosomia and on the ponderal index was assessed using a stepwise regression logistic model., RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) birth weight was 3482 (+/- 497) g at 37.4 +/- 1.0 weeks gestation. Macrosomia occurred in 29 cases (53.7%). Fetal insulin, C peptide and leptin levels were significantly higher in macrosomic than in non macrosomic infants. Maternal age, duration of diabetes, pregravid body mass index, parity, weight gain during pregnancy, presence of a microangiopathy, nephropathy, smoking habits, gestational hypertension or preeclampsia, and HbA1c levels throughout pregnancy did not differed between mothers of macrosomic and non macrosomic infants. In the stepwise analysis none of these covariates was explanatory of the ponderal index., CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of macrosomia remains very high in infants of type 1 diabetic mothers despite a reasonable degree of glycemic control. The variability of the fetal growth response to mild hyperglycemia prompts for the identification of other factors involved in the modulation of fetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We sought to reanalyze the concept of fetal macrosomia with regard to the ponderal index and to investigate the role of insulin, insulinlike growth factor I, leptin, and maternal factors on birth size in a population of infants with nondiabetic mothers., STUDY DESIGN: Venous cord blood levels of insulin, insulinlike growth factor I, insulinlike growth factor binding protein 3, and leptin were measured in 28 large-for-gestational-age and 21 appropriate-for-gestational-age newborns., RESULTS: Large-for-gestational-age newborns can be divided into symmetric and asymmetric subtypes according to the ponderal index. Mean leptin concentrations in cord blood were significantly higher in asymmetric than in symmetric large-for-gestational-age newborns (P =.01). A positive correlation was observed between leptin and the ponderal index (r = 0.53, P =.001) and between leptin and insulin concentrations in cord blood (r = 0.53, P =.008)., CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest that macrosomia should not be classified on the basis of birth weight and gestational age alone. We also show that asymmetric macrosomic infants with nondiabetic mothers have abnormal leptin and insulin concentrations.

AB  - Leptin, a small peptide produced by adipocytes, is implicated in an increasing number of endocrine regulations, including adiposity, satiety, puberty, and fertility. Although the factors involved in controlling maternal and fetal weight gain during pregnancy have not been fully elucidated, leptin has recently emerged as such a potential factor. In our study, we report the presence of high amounts of leptin mRNA and immunoreactive protein in the human placenta, establishing the placental synthesis of this hormone. A large (three- to fivefold) augmentation in leptin mRNA and protein was found in placentas from insulin-treated diabetic women. This finding was associated with increased concentrations of leptin and insulin in venous cord blood without modification of maternal circulating leptin levels. These data provide evidence that the placenta is a site for regulated leptin production in utero. Insulin is likely to play a critical role in this regulation, thus emphasizing the importance of placental leptin signaling in diabetic pregnancy.

AB  - Infants born small for gestational age (SGA) are known to have increased risk of developing several pathologies, including the metabolic syndrome, when they grow up. It has been described that both the growth pattern of these children as well as the risk of their presenting future metabolic disorders can be influenced by the expression of adipokines. Among them, chemerin has demonstrated to be implicated in lipid and glucose metabolism, presenting higher circulating concentration in diabetic and obese subjects. Thus, the aim of this study was to analyze the association of anthropometric parameters and plasmatic biochemical parameters with circulating chemerin concentration in SGA children. This prospective, longitudinal study was carried out in plasma samples of Caucasian children born SGA at Hospital Universitario de Alava-Txagorritxu. Significant positive correlations were observed between chemerin concentrations at 3 months and insulin values at 3 months and also with triglyceride levels at 24 months. These associations were maintained after adjustment by anthropometric parameters. Therefore, we suggest that circulating chemerin concentration, measured at an early age, might be an indicator of future metabolic alterations in SGA children.

AB  - Infants born small for gestational age (SGA) are at increased risk of perinatal morbidity, persistent short stature, and metabolic alterations in later life. Moreover, the post-natal growth pattern of SGA infants may be an important contributor to health outcomes later in life, which can be influenced by adipokines. The aims of this study were to compare plasma adipokine profiles (leptin, adiponectin, vaspin, chemerin, and nephroblastoma overexpressed (NOV/CCN3)) among SGA newborns aged 3 months, with low, normal, or high catch-up, to search for potential differences between males and females and to analyze the evolution of several adipokines in plasma from SGA newborns between 3 and 24 months. This prospective, longitudinal study was addressed in SGA Caucasian subjects at Hospital Universitario de Alava-Txagorritxu. We observed that infants with fast catch-up showed significantly lower birth weight than the other two groups. As far as adipokines are concerned, they could have an influence on catch-up type because differences among the three experimental groups were found. It may be proposed that health prognoses in infants with slow and fast catch-up are opposite, not only in adulthood but also during their first months. Finally, adipokine evolution patterns during the first 24 months of age differ, depending on the adipokine, and 24-month-old males show lower levels of leptin, adiponectin, and omentin than females.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity increases adult offspring risk for cardiovascular disease; however, the role of offspring adiposity in mediating this association remains poorly characterized., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of maternal pre-pregnant body mass index (maternal BMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) with neonatal cardiometabolic markers independent of fetal growth and neonatal adiposity., METHODS: A total of 753 maternal-infant pairs from the Healthy Start study, a large multiethnic pre-birth observational cohort were used. Neonatal cardiometabolic markers included cord blood glucose, insulin, glucose-to-insulin ratio (Glu/Ins), total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides, free fatty acids and leptin. Maternal BMI was abstracted from medical records or self-reported. GWG was calculated as the difference between the first pre-pregnant weight and the last weight measurement before delivery. Neonatal adiposity (percent fat mass) was measured within 72 h of delivery using whole-body air-displacement plethysmography., RESULTS: In covariate adjusted models, maternal BMI was positively associated with cord blood insulin (P=0.01) and leptin (P<0.001) levels, and inversely associated with cord blood HDL-c (P=0.05) and Glu/Ins (P=0.003). Adjustment for fetal growth or neonatal adiposity attenuated the effect of maternal BMI on neonatal insulin, rendering the association nonsignificant. However, maternal BMI remained associated with higher leptin (P<0.0011), lower HDL-c (P=0.02) and Glu/Ins (P=0.05), independent of neonatal adiposity. GWG was positively associated with neonatal insulin (P=0.02), glucose (P=0.03) and leptin levels (P<0.001) and negatively associated with Glu/Ins (P=0.006). After adjusting for neonatal adiposity, GWG remained associated with higher neonatal glucose (P=0.02) and leptin levels (P=0.02) and lower Glu/Ins (P=0.048)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal weight prior and/or during pregnancy is associated with neonatal cardiometabolic makers including leptin, glucose and HDL-c at delivery, independent of neonatal adiposity. Our results suggest that intrauterine exposure to maternal obesity influences metabolic processes beyond fetal growth and fat accretion.

AB  - Context: Fetuses exposed to an obese intrauterine environment are more likely to be born large-for-gestational age (LGA) and are at increased risk of obesity in childhood and cardiovascular disease and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus as adults, but which factors that influence the intrauterine environment is less clear., Objective: To investigate the association between circulating levels of leptin and adiponectin, measured multiple times during pregnancy, and birth weight and prevalence of LGA or small-for-gestational-age infants. The association between birth weight and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of adiponectin receptors and genes involved in nutrient transport in the placenta was also investigated., Design: Population-based prospective cohort [substudy of the STORK study (STORe barn og Komplikasjoner, translated as Large Babies and Complications)] from 2001 to 2008., Setting: University hospital. Patients or other participants: 300 women., Main Outcome Measures: Oral glucose tolerance test was performed twice along with adiponectin and leptin levels measured four times during pregnancy., Results: Circulating adiponectin was lower in mothers who gave birth to LGA offspring or had fetuses with high intrauterine abdominal circumference late in pregnancy. Adiponectin decreased most from early to late pregnancy in mothers who gave birth to LGA offspring, and the decrease was an independent predictor of birth weight. Adiponectin receptor 2 and system A amino acid transporter mRNA expression in placentas was negatively correlated with birth weight and was lower in placentas from LGA infants., Conclusions: Our findings suggest that maternal adiponectin may be an important predictor of fetal growth and birth weight, independent of body mass index and insulin resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypertensive disorders, fetal growth restriction and preterm birth are major obstetrical complications and are related to impaired placentation. Early identification of impaired placentation can advance clinical care by preventing or postpone adverse pregnancy outcome., OBJECTIVES: Determine whether sonographic assessed placental vascular development and concomitant changes in inflammation- and/or angiogenesis-related serumproteins differ in the first trimester between uncomplicated pregnancies and pregnancies with adverse outcome., STUDY DESIGN: This prospective longitudinal study defines adverse pregnancy outcome as conditions associated with impaired placentation; fetal growth restriction, hypertensive disorder, preterm birth and placental abruption. The vascularization index, flow index, vascularization flow index and placental volume were determined at 8, 10 and 12weeks pregnancy from 64 women using 3D power Doppler. Serum levels were analyzed for Angiopoetin-1 and -2, Leptin, VEGF-R, VEGF, and EGF., RESULTS: The vascularization index and vascular flow index increased in uneventful pregnancies with almost 50% between 8 and 12weeks, resulting in a ~50% higher vascularization index at 12weeks compared to women with an adverse pregnancy outcome. Women with an adverse pregnancy outcome (n=13) had significantly lower indices and placental volumes at all time points measured and these indices did not increase between 8 and 12weeks. Reduced vascular development was associated with increased Angiopoietin-1 levels at 8 and 12weeks and increased Leptin levels at 8weeks., CONCLUSIONS: Pregnancies with an adverse outcome caused by conditions associated with impaired placentation differ from uneventful pregnancies in having reduced placental vascularization accompanied by elevated circulating levels of Angiopoietin-1 and Leptin already in the first trimester.

AB  - AIMS: This study explored whether growth was poorer among very low birthweight (VLBW) infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and assessed adipokine levels as predictors of early growth., METHODS: We studied 53 VLBW infants born in Tampere University Hospital up to 12 months of corrected age (CA). The median gestational age of the 21 infants with BPD and 32 infants without BPD was 29 weeks, and the median birthweights were 930 (635-1470) and 1185 (650-1470) grams. Growth parameters, macronutrients intake and plasma levels of adipokines were measured., RESULTS: Bronchopulmonary dysplasia infants were lighter than controls until 36 weeks of CA, with catch-up growth achieved by three months of CA. Adipsin levels were lower in BPD infants at 28 days of postnatal age. High leptin levels seemed protective for low weight for height at nine months of CA. The duration of ventilator therapy predicted low weight for height, length for age and body mass index and BPD predicted low length for age at 12 months of CA., CONCLUSIONS: Catch-up growth in VLBW infants with BPD was achieved by three months of CA, but adipokines played a limited role in predicting growth. Shortening ventilator therapy could help growth in VLBW infants. Copyright ©2017 Foundation Acta Paediatrica. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a well-recognized hepatic manifestation of metabolic disease in adults and has been associated with the development of gestational diabetes (GDM). Hepatic insulin resistance can result in increased release of glucose (from gluconeogenesis) and free fatty acids (due to enhanced lipolysis), which can lead in turn to fetal overgrowth. However, the relationship between maternal metabolic factors (such as circulating levels of triglycerides, free fatty acids [FFA], or adipokines) and excessive fetal birthweight in NAFLD has not been carefully examined. In this study, we evaluated the relationship between NAFLD and the subsequent risk of large-for-gestational-age (LGA) birthweight., METHOD: Singleton nondiabetic pregnant women were evaluated for the presence of fatty liver at 10-14 weeks of gestation by abdominal ultrasound. The degree of fatty liver was classified as Grade 0-3 steatosis. At the time of liver ultrasound, maternal blood was taken after fasting and measured for adiponectin and FFA. LGA was defined as birthweight >90th percentile for gestational age., RESULTS: A total of 623 women were included in the analysis. The frequency of LGA was 10.9% (68/623), and the frequency of NAFLD was 18.9%. The risk of LGA increased significantly in patients with Grade 2-3 steatosis in the first trimester. The relationship between Grade 2-3 steatosis and LGA remained significant after adjustment for maternal age, pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM, and maternal serum triglyceride levels. The concentration of maternal blood adiponectin at 10-14 weeks was significantly lower in cases with LGA than non-LGA, but the maternal blood FFA concentrations were not different between the groups., CONCLUSION: The presence of Grade 2-3 steatosis on ultrasound in early pregnancy was associated with the increased risk of delivering an LGA infant, even after adjustment for multiple confounding factors including GDM. Adiponectin may be the linking biomarker between NAFLD and LGA.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the concentrations of adipokines in amniotic fluid (AF) and cord blood collected from discordant dichorionic-diamniotic (DCDA) twin fetuses., STUDY DESIGN: The study population included DCDA twins discordant for fetal growth (birth weight difference >10%) who either underwent mid-trimester amniocentesis for routine clinical indication (Cohort 1) or whose amniotic fluid was collected at the time of delivery (Cohort 2). In both cohorts, cord blood was collected at delivery., RESULTS: A total of 92 twin pairs were enrolled (n = 49 in Cohort 1; n = 43 in Cohort 2). In Cohort 1, the concentrations of adiponectin (median, 68.5 ng/mL vs 61.4 ng/mL; p<0.05) and leptin (median, 13.9 ng/mL vs 11.2 ng/mL; p<0.1) in mid-trimester AF were significantly higher in smaller compared with larger twins. In Cohort 2, the concentration of serpin E1 (median, 246.0 ng/mL vs 182.8 ng/mL; p<0.01) in AF at delivery was significantly higher in smaller twins, but no difference was noted in adiponectin and leptin concentrations. Levels of adiponectin (median, 10425.5 ng/mL vs 11552.0 ng/mL; p<0.005) and leptin (median, 2.1 ng/mL vs 2.6 ng/mL; p<0.005) were significantly lower in the cord blood of smaller twins whereas cord blood concentrations of serpin E1 (median, 15.5 ng/mL vs 13.3 ng/mL; p<0.05) was higher in the smaller twins., CONCLUSION: In discordant DCDA twin pairs, concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, and serpin E1 in mid-trimester AF, AF at delivery, and cord blood at birth vary significantly but predictably between the smaller and larger twins.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Presenting twins are less likely to develop respiratory complications than non-presenting twins. The precise reason for this difference is not well understood, although it is known that the presence of inflammation reduces the risk of respiratory morbidity at birth. To further investigate this association, we compared the concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers in mid-trimester amniotic fluid (AF) of asymptomatic twin pairs., STUDY DESIGN: The study population consisted of women with twin pregnancies who underwent mid-trimester amniocentesis (15-20 weeks) for routine clinical indications and delivered at term. AF was analyzed for pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-15, IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha), matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1, MMP-2, MMP-3, MMP-8, MMP-9, MMP-12), and chemokines (Complement Factor D/Adipsin, Serpin E1/PAI-1, Adiponectin/Acrp30, CRP, CCL2/MCP-1, Leptin, Resistin) using Luminex Performance Assay multiplex kits. Data were analyzed using Wilcoxon signed rank test., RESULTS: A total of 82 twin pairs were enrolled. Mid-trimester AF concentrations of IL-8, MMP-8, CRP, MCP-1, leptin, and resistin were significantly higher in the presenting twin compared with the non-presenting twin (p<0.05 for each). Differences in AF concentrations of IL-8, MMP-8, and CRP persisted after adjustment for the fetal growth restriction at the time of birth and chorionicity., CONCLUSION: These data suggest that, as early as the mid-trimester, the presenting fetus in an otherwise uncomplicated twin pregnancy is exposed to higher levels of pro-inflammatory mediators (especially IL-8, MMP-8, and CRP) than its non-presenting co-twin. Whether this pro-inflammatory milieu reduces the risk of neonatal respiratory morbidity at birth or has other functional implications needs to be further evaluated.

AB  - The concept of Developmental Origin of Health and Disease (DOHaD) postulates that adult-onset metabolic disorders may originate from suboptimal conditions during critical embryonic and fetal programming windows. In particular, nutritional disturbance during key developmental stages may program the set point of adiposity and its associated metabolic diseases later in life. Numerous studies in mammals have reported that maternal obesity and the resulting accelerated growth in neonates may affect adipocyte development, resulting in persistent alterations in adipose tissue plasticity (i.e., adipocyte proliferation and storage) and adipocyte function (i.e., insulin resistance, impaired adipokine secretion, reduced thermogenesis, and higher inflammation) in a sex- and depot-specific manner. Over recent years, adipose progenitor cells (APCs) have been shown to play a crucial role in adipose tissue plasticity, essential for its development, maintenance, and expansion. In this review, we aim to provide insights into the developmental timeline of lineage commitment and differentiation of APCs and their role in predisposing individuals to obesity and metabolic diseases. We present data supporting the possible implication of dysregulated APCs and aberrant perinatal adipogenesis through epigenetic mechanisms as a primary mechanism responsible for long-lasting adipose tissue dysfunction in offspring born to obese mothers.

AB  - Adipose tissue secretes a variety of adipokines, including leptin and adiponectin, which are involved in endocrine processes regulating glucose and fatty metabolism, energy expenditure, inflammatory response, immunity, cardiovascular function, and reproduction. The present article describes the fluctuations in circulating leptin and adiponectin as well as their patterns of secretion in women from birth to menopause. During pregnancy, leptin and adiponectin seem to act in an autocrine/paracrine fashion in the placenta and adipose tissue, playing a role in the maternal-fetal interface and contributing to glucose metabolism and fetal development. In newborns, adiponectin levels are two to three times higher than in adults. Full-term newborns have significantly higher leptin and adiponectin levels than preterms, whereas small-for-gestational-age infants have lower levels of these adipokines than adequate-for-gestational-age newborns. However, with weight gain, leptin concentrations increase significantly. Children between 5 and 8 years of age experience an increase in leptin and a decrease in adiponectin regardless of body mass index, with a reversal of the newborn pattern for adiponectin: plasma adiponectin levels at age five are inversely correlated with percentage of body fat. In puberty, leptin plays a role in the regulation of menstrual cycles. In adults, it has been suggested that obese individuals exhibit both leptin resistance and decreased serum adiponectin levels. In conclusion, a progressive increase in adiposity throughout life seems to influence the relationship between leptin and adiponectin in women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth hormone (GH) treatment in short children born small for gestational age (SGA) may result in metabolic changes with potential long-term effects., METHODS: 149 short SGA children (mean birth weight 2.0 +/- 0.6 kg, age 5.5 +/- 1.5 years, height standard deviation score (SDS) -3.1 +/- 0.6) were randomised to: low-dose GH therapy (0.033 mg/kg/day) for 2 years; high-dose GH therapy (0.100 mg/kg/day) for 1 year, or mid-dose GH therapy (0.067 mg/kg/day) for 1 year. Leptin, ghrelin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), IGF binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), lipids, fasting blood glucose and fasting insulin were assessed at baseline, 12 and 24 months., RESULTS: After 1 year of active treatment, GH significantly reduced serum ghrelin and increased IGF-I SDS and insulin levels. Regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between ghrelin and IGF-I SDS (p < 0.001). Leptin and IGFBP-1 also declined (both p < 0.05). Changes in insulin levels reversed upon discontinuation. Improvements in lipid profile were nonsignificant and fasting blood glucose levels remained within the normal range., CONCLUSION: In short SGA children, ghrelin and leptin reductions associated with GH treatment may occur through a negative feedback loop of the GH-IGF-I axis. Consequently, via ghrelin and leptin suppression, GH treatment may modify food intake and body composition and potentially improve long-term metabolic outcomes. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Leptin expression in third trimester placenta (p) and leptin concentrations in umbilical cord blood (cb) were investigated in normal pregnancies [n = 10 (p), 31 (cb)] and abnormal pregnancies complicated with (i) maternal insulin-dependent diabetes [IDDM: n = 3 (p), 13 (cb)], (ii) gestational diabetes [GD: n = 2 (p), 10 (cb)] and (iii) fetal growth retardation [FGR: n = 5 (p), 5 (cb)]. By in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, placental leptin mRNA and protein were co-localized to the syncytiotrophoblast and villous vascular endothelial cells. Leptin receptor was immunolocalized to the syncytiotrophoblast. Relative to controls, the FGR group was characterized by low concentrations of placental and cord blood leptin. In a twin pregnancy, the normal-sized infant exhibited more placental and cord blood leptin than its growth-retarded twin. In contrast, both diabetic groups exhibited high concentrations of placental leptin mRNA and protein. The IDDM group exhibited the highest concentrations of leptin in cord blood. No change was observed in the expression of the leptin receptor in either the growth-retarded or diabetic pregnancies. In conclusion, the localization of placental leptin suggests that it may be released into both maternal and fetal blood. Furthermore, in fetal growth-retarded and diabetic pregnancies, the changes in leptin expression in the placenta and in leptin concentrations in umbilical cord blood appear to be related.

AB  - Proinflammatory cytokines produced by immune cells play a central role in the increased intestinal epithelial permeability during inflammation. Expansion of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is currently considered a consequence of intestinal inflammation. Whether VAT per se plays a role in early modifications of intestinal barrier remains unknown. The aim of this study was to demonstrate the direct role of adipocytes in regulating paracellular permeability of colonic epithelial cells (CECs). We show in adult rats born with intrauterine growth retardation, a model of VAT hypertrophy, and in rats with VAT graft on the colon, that colonic permeability was increased without any inflammation. This effect was associated with altered expression of tight junction (TJ) proteins occludin and ZO-1. In coculture experiments, adipocytes decreased transepithelial resistance (TER) of Caco-2 CECs and induced a disorganization of ZO-1 on TJs. Intraperitoneal administration of leptin to lean rats increased colonic epithelial permeability and altered ZO-1 expression and organization. Treatment of HT29-19A CECs with leptin, but not adiponectin, dose-dependently decreased TER and altered TJ and F-actin cytoskeleton organization through a RhoA-ROCK-dependent pathway. Our data show that adipocytes and leptin directly alter TJ function in CECs and suggest that VAT could impair colonic epithelial barrier.Le Drean, G., Haure-Mirande, V., Ferrier, L., Bonnet, C., Hulin, P., de Coppet, P., Segain, J.-P. Visceral adipose tissue and leptin increase colonic epithelial tight junction permeability via a RhoA-ROCK-dependent pathway.

AB  - Birth weight (BW) is an important indicator for newborn health. Both high and low BW is associated with increased risks for adult metabolic diseases. AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), mTOR (mechanistic target of rapamycin), and insulin/IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) pathways may function as placental sensors of maternal hormonal and nutritional status. However, the physiological role of these pathways in placenta has not been completely elucidated. To evaluate expression and activation of AMPK, mTOR, and insulin/IGF1 pathways and its association with placental weight (PW), BW, and maternal hormonal and metabolic status, we performed a cross-sectional study in placentas from non-obese mothers with SGA (n = 17), AGA (n = 19) and LGA (n = 10) newborns. We analyzed placental expression of total and phosphorylated key proteins from the AMPK, mTOR and insulin/IGF1 pathways. Maternal and cord blood hormones were determined by ELISA. AMPK and LKB1 activation correlated negatively with PW and BW, cord leptin, and pregestational BMI. Placental SIRT1 inversely correlated with BW, cord leptin, neonatal HOMA-IR, and maternal IGF1. PGC1alpha correlated negatively with PW and BW. Phosphorylated mTOR positively correlated with maternal glucose, PW and BW. IGF1R was lower in SGA. No changes in p-IGF1R, INSRb, total AKT or p-AKT were found, and pPDK1 was lower in SGA and LGA. These results suggest that placental AMPK, insulin/IGF1, and mTOR pathways may influence fetal growth, perhaps regulating placental physiology, even in metabolically healthy pregnancies. Our study highlights these nutrient sensing pathways as potential molecular mechanisms modulating placental adaptations and, thus, long-term metabolic health.

AB  - Alterations in birth weight impact postnatal outcome and adult metabolic health. Therefore, fetal growth regulation is crucial for preventing chronic metabolic diseases. Leptin has been suggested to play an important role in placental and fetal growth, albeit its specific mechanisms of action have not been elucidated. The aim of this study was to analyze leptin concentrations in placenta, cord blood, and maternal blood of SGA, AGA, and LGA (small, adequate and large for gestational age, respectively) newborns, as well as placental leptin receptor (LEPRa and LEPRb) protein expression. We performed a cross-sectional comparative study in 3 groups of healthy mothers and their term newborns at delivery (SGA, AGA, and LGA, n=20 per group). Placental, maternal blood, and cord blood leptin content were measured by ELISA. Placental LEPRa and LEPRb protein expression were determined by Western Blot. Maternal leptin concentrations correlated positively with maternal weight before and at the end of gestation, without differences between groups. Cord leptin is higher in LGA and lower in SGA, whereas placental leptin is higher in SGA. Placental leptin was inversely correlated with placental weight, independently from maternal weight and gestational age. Both LEPRa and LEPRb expression are lower in SGA, while LEPRa positively correlated with placental weight and birthweight. The current findings indicate that placental leptin and its receptors are differentially expressed in SGA, AGA, and LGA newborns. We suggest that placental leptin and LEPR protein expression may influence placental growth and thus, birth weight. Copyright © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart . New York.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: To determine the extent to which gestational fasting and postload levels of glucose explain differences in infant fat mass between UK-born Pakistani and white British infants., METHODS: Analyses were undertaken in a prospective pregnancy cohort study of 1,415 women and their singleton live-born infants (629 white British and 786 Pakistani). Infant fat mass was assessed by cord-blood leptin levels and fetal insulin secretion by cord-blood insulin levels. Maternal OGTTs were completed at 26-28 weeks of gestation., RESULTS: Pakistani women had higher fasting and postload glucose levels and greater incidence of gestational diabetes than white British women. Higher fasting and postload glucose levels were associated with higher cord-blood levels of insulin and leptin in all participants, irrespective of ethnicity. Cord-blood leptin levels were 16% (95% CI 6, 26) higher in Pakistani than in white British infants. After adjustment for fasting glucose levels, this difference attenuated to 7% (-3, 16), and with additional adjustment for cord-blood insulin levels it attenuated further to 5% (-4, 14). Path analyses supported the hypothesis that fasting glucose levels mediate the relationship of Pakistani ethnicity to greater fat mass at birth, as measured by cord-blood leptin levels; on average, 19% of this mediation involved fetal insulin secretion. Postload glucose levels did not act as an important mediator of ethnic differences in cord-blood leptin levels. Results were very similar when 130 women with gestational diabetes were removed., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: These novel findings suggest a role of maternal pregnancy glycaemia in mediating differences in fat mass between Pakistani and white British infants.

AB  - Previous evidence suggests that exposure to outdoor air pollution during pregnancy could alter fetal metabolic function, which could increase the risk of obesity in childhood. However, to our knowledge, no epidemiologic study has investigated the association between prenatal exposure to air pollution and indicators of fetal metabolic function. We investigated the association between maternal exposure to nitrogen dioxide and fine particulate matter (aerodynamic diameter <=2.5 microm) and umbilical cord blood leptin and adiponectin levels with mixed-effects linear regression models among 1,257 mother-infant pairs from the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, conducted in Canada (2008-2011). We observed that an interquartile-range increase in average exposure to fine particulate matter (3.2 microg/m(3)) during pregnancy was associated with an 11% (95% confidence interval: 4, 17) increase in adiponectin levels. We also observed 13% (95% confidence interval: 6, 20) higher adiponectin levels per interquartile-range increase in average exposure to nitrogen dioxide (13.6 parts per billion) during pregnancy. Significant associations were seen between air pollution markers and cord blood leptin levels in models that adjusted for birth weight z score but not in models that did not adjust for birth weight z score. The roles of prenatal exposure to air pollution and fetal metabolic function in the potential development of childhood obesity should be further explored. Copyright © The Author 2016.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin is an important weight regulator and during pregnancy leptin is not only synthesized in adipose tissue but also in the placenta., AIM: To examine changes in serum leptin levels in women with type 1 diabetes mellitus during pregnancy and post delivery in relation to concomitant changes in maternal body weight, birth weight, glycemic control, and blood pressure., METHODS: Non-fasting serum leptin from 45 women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were studied consecutively throughout pregnancy and 3 months post partum., RESULTS: Serum leptin was positively associated with HbA1c in week 18, 22 and 30 (r=0.38, 0.41, and 0.54, respectively, p<0.05, adjusted for body weight). Moreover, serum leptin correlated positively with maternal body weight and BMI (0.45<r<0.66, p<0.05). Serum leptin was significantly lower after delivery than during pregnancy where the levels showed no change from gestational week 14 to week 38. In obese women (BMI >25 kg/m2), the changes during pregnancy and the level of serum leptin were significantly greater compared to lean women (p<0.05). The women with low ambulatory blood pressure (lower tertile, mean arterial blood pressure <83.4 mmHg) showed the lowest level of serum leptin throughout pregnancy and it changed significantly differently from the women with higher blood pressure (p<0.05)., CONCLUSION: Changes in serum leptin levels of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes mellitus were associated with parallel changes in maternal body weight and glycemic control. Women with low blood pressure had the lowest serum leptin levels throughout pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The etiology of childhood obesity and the associated morbidity is multifactorial. Recently, data suggesting a prenatal programming towards later childhood obesity and metabolic deregulation through the intrauterine environment has emerged. This study explored the concentrations of adipokines and their mutual relationship at birth in children born to non-diabetic mothers., METHODS: Adiponectin, leptin and sOB-R were measured using ELISA-based commercial kits in umbilical cord blood from 60 neonates (30 born large for gestational age [LGA] and 30 born appropriate for gestational age [AGA]). Children exposed to maternal diabetes, chronic disease and preeclampsia were excluded., RESULTS: The LGA group exhibited significantly elevated concentrations of leptin (p<0.001) and of free leptin index (p<0.001) and decreased sOB-R concentrations (p=0.005) when compared to the AGA group, which persisted in multiple regression analysis after taking the gestational age into account (p=0.048, p<0.001 and p<0.001, respectively). Only a trend towards a difference in adiponectin was demonstrated (p=0.057) regardless of adjustment (p=0.150). However, the leptin/adiponectin ratio was elevated in the LGA group (p=0.008), regardless of adjustment (p=0.039)., CONCLUSION: The data indicate a disturbance of adipokines in macrosomic newborns and that the mutual ratios between adipokines may provide a more sensitive marker of metabolic disturbance than any isolated adipokine.

AB  - Recent studies suggest that the perinatal period is a sensitive part in human development with respect to the pathogenesis of metabolic diseases in adulthood. Neonates, who are either small or large for gestational age (SGA or LGA) have a greater risk of developing obesity and insulin resistance in later life. The term "perinatal priming" is used to describe this phenomenon. Therefore, in the present study we first aimed to investigate if birth weight influences fetal adiponectin and RBP-4 metabolism. Umbilical cord blood was obtained form 40 neonates born on term+/-4 weeks and the adipokine concentrations in the serum were measured. In this analysis adiponectin but not RBP-4 levels showed a positive significant correlation to birth weight. Since maternal preconceptional obesity is associated with an increased birth weight and the risk for LGA neonates, we further aimed to investigate, if the maternal nutritional state influences fetal adiponectin and RBP-4. Therefore umbilical cord blood levels of the adipokines were correlated to maternal preconceptional BMI. In this analysis, neither adiponectin nor RBP-4 levels showed a significant correlation. Taken together, in the present study for the first time we directly compare fetal adiponectin and RBP-4 levels in respect to birth weight and maternal preconceptional BMI. Our data suggest that (1) adiponectin is more likely to have a role in perinatal priming of obesity and insulin resistance than RBP-4 and (2) that birth weight has a greater impact on fetal adipokine serum levels than maternal preconceptional obesity.

AB  - CONTEXT: Low concentrations of estradiol and progesterone are hallmarks of adverse pregnancy outcomes as is maternal obesity. During pregnancy, placental cholesterol is the sole source of sex steroids. Cholesterol trafficking is the limiting step in sex steroid biosynthesis and is mainly mediated by the translocator protein (TSPO), present in the mitochondrial outer membrane., OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effects of maternal obesity in placental sex steroid biosynthesis and TSPO regulation., DESIGN/PARTICIPANTS: One hundred forty-four obese (body mass index 30-35 kg/m(2)) and 90 lean (body mass index 19-25 kg/m(2)) pregnant women (OP and LP, respectively) recruited at scheduled term cesarean delivery. Placenta and maternal blood were collected., SETTING: This study was conducted at MetroHealth Medical Center (Cleveland, Ohio)., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal metabolic components (fasting glucose, insulin, leptin, estradiol, progesterone, and total cholesterol) and placental weight were measured. Placenta (mitochondria and membranes separated) and cord blood cholesterol values were verified. The expression and regulation of TSPO and mitochondrial function were analyzed., RESULTS: Plasma estradiol and progesterone concentrations were significantly lower (P < .04) in OP as compared with LP women. Maternal and cord plasma cholesterol were not different between groups. Placental citrate synthase activity and mitochondrial DNA, markers of mitochondrial density, were unchanged, but the mitochondrial cholesterol concentrations were 40% lower in the placenta of OP. TSPO gene and protein expressions were decreased 2-fold in the placenta of OP. In vitro trophoblast activation of the innate immune pathways with lipopolysaccharide and long-chain saturated fatty acids reduced TSPO expression by 2- to 3-fold (P < .05)., CONCLUSION: These data indicate that obesity in pregnancy impairs mitochondrial steroidogenic function through the negative regulation of mitochondrial TSPO.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High infancy weight gain is associated with increased body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance (IR) in later life, but the association with later body composition has not been well explored. Appetite regulatory hormones may be programmed in early life, but data to support this are lacking., OBJECTIVE: We investigated the effect of weight gain in infancy on body composition, IR, leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin at 17 y of age., DESIGN: This was an observational study of 95 term and appropriate-for-gestational-age infants. We measured weight at birth and 9 mo of age and, for a subgroup (n = 60), at 3 and 6 mo of age. Changes in weight SD scores from 0 to 9, 0 to 3, 3 to 6, and 6 to 9 mo of age were calculated. Follow-up examinations at 10 and 17 y of age included body fat (BF) assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry scanning. We measured serum leptin, ghrelin adiponectin, and IR at 17 y of age., RESULTS: Weight gain from 0 to 9 mo of age was positively associated with BMI (P < 0.003), percentage BF (P < 0.05), and percentage trunk fat (TF) (P < 0.03) but not with percentage TF relative to total BF, in childhood and adolescence, and most of these effects were explained by growth from 0 to 3 mo of age. Weight gains from 0 to 9 and 0 to 3 mo of age were not related to IR or leptin but were negatively associated with ghrelin and adiponectin corrected for BF at 17 y of age., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that high weight gain in infancy, especially from 0 to 3 mo of age, has a role in programming both BF and concentrations of ghrelin and adiponectin in adolescence, whereas there was no effect on IR or leptin in this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to examine the association of acylated and total ghrelin levels at birth in preterm infants with anthropometric features and with related hormones in infants and their mothers., DESIGN: Prospective, descriptive study., METHODS: In total 23 pregnant women and their 26 preterm infants were involved in the study (3 twin pregnancies; gestational age, 25-35 weeks). Maternal and umbilical vein blood samples were taken after the delivery. Serum acylated and total ghrelin, leptin, cortisol, insulin, GH, and glucose were determined., RESULTS: The mean level of acylated ghrelin concentration was higher in the maternal than in the cord blood (P<0.01) and there was a significant correlation between the fetal and maternal acylated ghrelin levels (P<0.01). The total ghrelin concentration was higher in neonates than in mothers (P<0.01), but there was no correlation between them. The multivariate regression analysis for fetal acylated and maternal total ghrelin as dependent variables shows that the fetal acylated ghrelin has two independent predictors, the maternal acylated ghrelin (P<0.01) and the fetal cortisol (P<0.05), whereas the maternal total ghrelin has only one independent predictor, the maternal glucose (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: These data provide the first evidence that umbilical cord acylated ghrelin concentrations are lower than in maternal blood and support the hypothesis that the acylation process in the fetus is partly affected by cortisol and the placenta may play a role in this process.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a difference in maternal leptin concentration and cord blood concentration, consistent with the hypothesis of a noncommunicating, two-compartement model of fetoplacental leptin regulation., METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 139 women, identified as having an uncomplicated pregnancy, from an antecubital vein at delivery. Cord blood samples were taken from the umbilical vein. Leptin was measured by radioimmunoassay, and its relationship to fetal and maternal anthropometrics was assessed by Spearman correlation. Differences in maternal and cord blood leptin levels between male and female infants were tested with the Mann-Whitney Utest. Maternal and cord blood leptin were compared by the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The outcome measures were maternal and cord blood leptin at delivery, fetal birth weight, length, weight/length ratio, and ponderal index, maternal prepregnancy body mass index, pregnancy weight gain, relative weight gain, and body mass index at delivery., RESULTS: No correlations were found between maternal and cord blood leptin concentrations. Fetal leptin level correlated with birth weight (rho = 0.665; P <.0001), length (rho = 0.490; P <.0001), ponderal index (rho = 0.260; P =.002), and weight/length ratio (rho = 0.625; P <.0001). Median leptin concentrations were higher in female (9.3 ng/mL, range 1.5-34.4 ng/mL) than in male (8.2 ng/mL, range 1.6-38.3 ng/mL) neonates, but this difference was statistically not significant. Logistic regression analysis showed a significant influence on umbilical venous leptin concentration for birth weight (P <.0001) but not for gender. Maternal leptin concentrations were significantly higher than cord leptin concentrations (P <.0005 for the male and female neonates and the entire group)., CONCLUSION: There was no correlation between maternal and cord leptin, which supports the hypothesis of a noncommunicating, two-compartment model of fetoplacental leptin regulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether circulating levels of leptin differed between women with preeclampsia and women who had an uncomplicated pregnancy., METHODS: Maternal and umbilical venous plasma leptin concentrations obtained at delivery were compared in 36 pairs of women with either preeclampsia or normal pregnancy, matched 1:1 for prepregnancy body mass index and fetal gestational age at delivery., RESULTS: Prepregnancy body mass index was 21.1 +/- 2.1 kg/m2 in either study group (range 17.6-25.3 kg/m2 and 17.7-25.3 kg/m2 in the normal and preeclamptic group, respectively). Mean fetal gestational age at delivery was 40.1 +/- 1.3 weeks and 40.1 +/- 1.2 weeks in the normal and preeclamptic group, respectively. Median leptin concentrations were significantly lower (P <.0001) in women with preeclampsia (8.3 ng/mL, range 3.5-20.0 ng/mL) than in normal pregnant women (20.2 ng/mL, range 6.0-63.7 ng/mL). Median umbilical venous leptin was not significantly different between groups (preeclampsia 11.8 ng/mL, range 2.0-37.2 ng/mL; normal 7.6 ng/mL, range 1.6-24.3 ng/mL; P = .377). Umbilical venous leptin levels correlated positively with birth weight in both groups (preeclampsia rho = 0.501, P = .002; normal rho = 0.517, P = .001), whereas no correlations were found between maternal and fetal hormone concentrations. Maternal leptin concentrations did not correlate with birth weight., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the correlation between umbilical venous leptin concentration and birth weight is independent of the presence of preeclampsia. Given the inconsistency in literature concerning circulating leptin levels in preeclampsia, further studies should investigate the regulatory systems of leptin in preeclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between umbilical venous leptin concentration and gender in 20 pairs of newborns matched 1:1 for birth weight and gestational age at sampling., MATERIALS: Blood samples were obtained from 40 women at delivery, identified as having an uncomplicated pregnancy. Umbilical venous blood samples were obtained from their newborns (20 males and 20 females) at birth. Specimens were analyzed using a human leptin 125-I radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: Fetal leptin correlated positively with birth weight (rs = 0.541; P < .001). Umbilical venous leptin concentrations in female newborns (median: 10.7 ng/mL, range: 3.5-34.4 ng/mL) were significantly higher (P = .028) than in male newborns (median: 7.7 ng/mL, range: 2.0-19.3 ng/mL). There was no significant correlation between maternal and fetal leptin concentrations. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed birth weight and gender to be independent factors influencing fetal cord leptin., CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that in the fetus, as in children and adults, gender and weight are the major determinants of circulating leptin levels.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate cord blood leptin concentrations and their relationship to birth weight and gender in term pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia. Cord blood samples were obtained from 52 women, identified as having pre-eclampsia, and their newborns (31 males and 21 females) immediately after birth. Specimens were analyzed using a human leptin 125I radioimmunoassay. The relationship between leptin and anthropometrics was assessed by Spearman correlation. Differences in cord blood leptin levels between male and female infants were tested with the Mann-Whitney U test. The correlation between leptin and gender was computed using the product-moment-biseral correlation analysis for continuous and dichotomous variables. The multiple logistic regression analysis examined influences of sex, birth length, birth weight, birth weight/birth length ratio, ponderal index and maternal leptin as covariates on the fetal cord leptin level. Fetal leptin correlated positively with birth weight, length and weight/length ratio, in the total group and in the male subgroup and additionally with ponderal index in the female subgroup. Cord blood leptin concentrations in female newborns were significantly higher than in male newborns (p = 0.015), and concentrations correlated with gender (r = -0.315; p = 0.023). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed four potential independent factors influencing fetal cord leptin: gender, birth weight, birth weight/birth length ratio and maternal leptin. In conclusion, cord leptin concentrations in pregnancies complicated by pre-eclampsia correlate positively with birth weight and gender. Leptin concentrations in female newborns are higher compared to male newborns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is thought to mediate, in part, the link between obesity and insulin resistance, and women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) have raised serum TNF-alpha concentrations. Our objective was to investigate whether systemic TNF-alpha administration into gravid C57BL6/J mice causes a GDM-like syndrome and affects growth and adipose tissue (AT) development in the offspring. METHODS: We assessed glucose tolerance and reproductive outcome in mice infused with saline, or 2 mu g or 4 mu g recombinant mouse (rm) TNF-alpha by subcutaneous mini-osmotic pumps between days (d) 11.5 and 18.5 of gestation. Subsequently, we studied the effects of the 2-mu g dose on maternal AT metabolism. Finally, the growth of offspring exposed to 2 mu g rm TNF-alpha in utero was followed until 8 weeks postnatal age. At 8 weeks, we assessed AT accumulation, as well as adipocyte area in white A T and insulin sensitivity in males, and adipokine mRNA levels in various AT depots in females. RESULTS: The peak glucose response to an intraperitoneal glucose stimulus in late-gravid mice and fetal weight were higher with 2 mu g but not 4 mu g rmTNF-alpha compared with saline; however, 2 mu g TNF-alpha, did not affect AT parameters. The female but not male offspring of these mice showed accelerated growth, hyperadiposity, robustly increased leptin expression in all AT depots, and raised fasting blood glucose. CONCLUSIONS: TNF-alpha infusion (2 mu g for 7 days) in gravid mice resulted in a mild GDM syndrome and accelerated AT development in the offspring in a sex-specific manner. The data suggest that TNF-alpha. mediates in part the effects of GDM on fetal growth and postnatal adiposity, and constitutes a potential mediator of intrauterine programming.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the serum leptin levels in cord blood of Pakistani newborns and to ascertain the relationship between serum leptin and anthropometric parameters i.e. birth weight, length and OFC., STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study., PLACE AND DURATION: Lady Dufferin Hospital and Ziauddin Hospital, Karachi from 1999 to 2000., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Leptin concentration was measured in 110 newborns of mothers of normal antenatal history from venous cord blood, using Active Elisa Kit (DSL-10-23100). Samples were selected according to availability., RESULTS: Mean birth weight, length and occipitofrontal circumference (OFC) were 3.0+/-0.4 kg, 48.7+/-2.3 cms and 33.1+/-0.8 cms, respectively. Mean serum leptin levels was 10.0+/-7.5 ng/ml. Serum leptin levels were found to be positively correlated with birth weight (r=0.16, p=0.04), and OFC (r=0.33, p<0.01), whereas no significant relationship was found with length of the babies., CONCLUSION: The reported results suggest that leptin may play role in newborns body weight and energy expenditure as in adults and children.

AB  - Leptin, an adipocyte hormone involved in energy homeostasis, is important in reproduction and pregnancy. Questions yet to be addressed include the source of higher leptin during pregnancy and its relationship to pregnancy outcome and fetal growth. The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between placental leptin gene expression, placental leptin protein concentration and maternal plasma leptin concentration among control pregnant women, women with pre-eclampsia and women with growth-restricted infants. We also investigated the relationship between placental leptin expression and the placental expression of enzymes involved in cellular lipid balance: fatty acid translocase (CD36), carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPT-1B) and lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Placental leptin expression, placental protein and maternal plasma concentration were higher in pre-eclampsia than in controls but not in women with growth-restricted infants. Placental leptin expression and placental protein were higher in the preterm pre-eclamptic subjects, whereas maternal leptin was higher in the term pre-eclamptic subjects. The placental gene expression of CD36, CPT-1B and LPL were not different among the groups. This study suggests that despite similar failed placental bed vascular remodelling in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), leptin gene expression is higher only in preterm pre-eclampsia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipocytokines are important regulators of insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to compare maternal adipocytokines in early pregnancy among women diagnosed with and without gestational diabetes (GDM) months later., DESIGN: A nested case-control study., PATIENTS: Adiponectin, resistin and interleukin-6 (IL-6) were measured in 59 nulliparous women (30 women with GDM and 29 controls) in plasma obtained in early pregnancy. Patients underwent routine testing for GDM in late pregnancy., MEASUREMENTS: Adiponectin was measured using radioimmunoassay. Resistin and IL-6 were measured by ELISA. Statistical analysis included Student's t-test, logistic regression and Pearson's correlation., RESULTS: Groups were not different by baseline descriptors or obstetric outcomes. Mean gestational age at sampling was 9.3 +/- 2.6 weeks. Adiponectin was lower (P < 0.001) in women who later developed GDM compared to controls (4.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 6.9 +/- 0.6 microg/ml). Adiponectin was negatively associated with the development of GDM (P = 0.002; OR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.88) and the association persisted in multivariable analysis controlling for confounders (P = 0.01; OR: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.52, 0.92). Women with first trimester adiponectin concentrations < 25th% were 10 times more likely to be diagnosed with GDM (OR 10.2; 95% CI 1.3, 78.7). Early adiponectin concentrations negatively correlated with BMI (P = 0.01; r = -0.32) and subsequent 50 g glucose challenge (P = 0.03; r =-0.29). Mean resistin and IL-6 concentrations were not different between the two groups., CONCLUSIONS: Women with GDM have evidence of altered adipocyte function as measured by adiponectin early in pregnancy, months before the clinical diagnosis of GDM is traditionally made.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We hypothesize that racial differences in utero contribute to the racial disparity in prostate cancer risk. Leptin is a candidate for evaluating this hypothesis because it influences fetal development and newborn growth., METHODS: We measured leptin concentration by ELISA in venous cord blood collected from 70 African-American and 37 white male full-term babies. We measured sex steroid hormones and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis concentrations previously. Separately by race, we calculated the geometric mean leptin concentration and estimated the geometric mean adjusted for birth and placental weights, mother's age and parity, time of day and season of birth, and sex steroid hormone and IGF axis concentrations by linear regression., RESULTS: Leptin was positively correlated with birth (r = 0.34) and placental (r = 0.25) weights, IGF-1 (r = 0.21), and IGF binding protein-3 (r = 0.29) adjusting for race. Unadjusted geometric mean leptin did not differ (P = 0.92) between African Americans (5,280 pg/mL; 95% CI: 4,322-6,451) and whites (5,187 pg/mL; 95% CI: 3,938-6,832). Adjusted geometric mean leptin was nonstatistically significantly higher (P = 0.15) in African Americans (5,954 pg/mL; 95% CI: 4,725-7,502) than in whites (4,133 pg/mL; 95% CI: 2,890-5,910)., CONCLUSION: We observed a nonsignificantly higher adjusted cord blood leptin concentration in African-American male babies than in white male babies, although unadjusted levels were similar., IMPACT: These findings do not support the hypothesis that leptin level in utero contributes to the racial disparity in prostate cancer risk in adulthood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intrauterine growth retardation due to maternal under-nutrition increases susceptibility to obesity and insulin resistance. We reported earlier in the offspring of mineral or vitamin restricted rat dams, a high body fat percentage and decreased insulin secretion to glucose challenge. This study determined whether or not central adiposity and altered adipocytokine profile were associated with high body fat content., METHODS: Body fat percentage; glucose, insulin and adipocytokine levels in fasting plasma and fresh weights of epididymal fat pads were determined in the six months old male offspring of Wistar NIN rat dams on chronic 50 percent restriction of vitamins or minerals throughout their growth, gestation, lactation and weaned on to restricted diets or restricted mothers/offspring rehabilitated from different time points., RESULTS: In line with high body fat percent, chronic restriction of vitamins and minerals increased the epididymal fat pad weight. Maternal vitamin restriction decreased plasma adiponectin and increased leptin levels whereas mineral restriction decreased both. Both the treatments did not affect plasma TNF-alpha levels or insulin resistance status (HOMA-IR). Rehabilitation from parturition but not weaning, rescued the changes in the offspring., CONCLUSION: High body fat percentage in the offspring of vitamin restricted or mineral restricted rat dams was associated with increased abdominal adiposity (epididymal fat pad weight) and differential expression of adipocytokines but not insulin resistance. The changes could be mitigated by rehabilitation from birth but not weaning.

AB  - Birth size has been associated with adult life diseases, but the endocrine factors that are likely involved are not established. We evaluated the associations of maternal and cord blood hormones with birth size in normal pregnancies, and examined possible effect modification by maternal height, on the basis of prior suggestive evidence. In a prospective study of normal singleton pregnancies in Boston, USA and Shanghai, China, maternal hormone levels at the 27th gestational week were available for 225 pregnancies in Boston and 281 in Shanghai and cord blood measurements for 92 pregnancies in Boston and 110 in Shanghai. Pearson partial correlation coefficients of log-transformed hormone levels with birth weight and length were calculated. Overall, positive correlations with birth weight were found for maternal estriol (r = 0.19; p < 0.001) and progesterone (r = 0.15; p < 0.001) and these associations were more evident among taller mothers. There was an inverse association of cord blood progesterone (r = -0.16; p < 0.03) with birth weight. In Boston, cord blood IGF-1 was positively associated with birth weight (r = 0.22; p < 0.04) and length (r = 0.25; p < 0.02), particularly among taller mothers (r = 0.43 and 0.38, respectively; p < 0.02), whereas among taller mothers in Shanghai the associations of IGF-2 with birth size appeared to be at least as strong as those of IGF-1. In conclusion, maternal estriol and progesterone, and cord blood IGF-1 were positively correlated with birth size. All correlations tended to be more pronounced among offspring of taller mothers. Among taller mothers in Shanghai, IGF-2 appeared to be at least as strongly associated with birth size as IGF-1.

AB  - PURPOSE: Placental weight has been associated with mammographic pattern and coronary heart disease in the adult offspring, but the mechanisms are unknown. We evaluated the associations of maternal and cord blood hormones with placental weight in normal pregnancies., METHODS: Prospective study of 167 normal singleton pregnancies in Boston, USA and 256 in Shanghai, China. Maternal hormone levels at the 27th gestational week were available for all pregnancies. Cord blood measurements were available for 86 pregnancies in Boston and 104 in Shanghai. Pearson partial correlation coefficients of log-transformed hormone levels with placental weight were calculated., RESULTS: Maternal levels of estriol, testosterone, and progesterone (P < .05) were positively associated with placental weight. There was no such evidence for adiponectin, prolactin, and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I. Cord blood steroids tended to be inversely associated with placental weight, the results being statistically significant for testosterone (P < .05). There was a marginally significant positive association of cord blood IGF-I with placental weight. Reported results were adjusted for study center., CONCLUSIONS: Placental weight appears to be positively correlated with maternal steroids. Its correlation with cord blood steroids, however, appears inverse, compatible with negative feedback mechanisms. There is also a suggestion for placental weight to be positively associated with cord blood IGF-I. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breast cancer is less common in China than in the United States and perinatal characteristics predict breast cancer risk in the offspring. We determined levels of pregnancy hormones in Boston and Shanghai to identify those possibly involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer., PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We compared maternal and cord blood levels of estradiol, estriol, testosterone, progesterone, prolactin, insulin-like growth factors (IGF) 1 and 2, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3, adiponectin and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) in 241 Caucasian and 295 Chinese women., RESULTS: In both centers, hormone levels at the 16th were predictive of those at the 27th gestational week, but there was little correlation between maternal and cord blood levels. In cord blood, we found significantly (P < 0.01) higher levels of estradiol (44.2%), testosterone (54.5%), IGF-2 (22.7%) and strikingly SHBG (104.6%) in Shanghai women, whereas the opposite was true for IGF-1 (-36.8%)., CONCLUSIONS: Taking into account the current understanding of the plausible biological role of the examined endocrine factors, those likely to be involved in the intrauterine origin of breast cancer are SHBG and IGF-2, with higher cord blood levels among Chinese, and IGF-1, with higher cord blood levels among Caucasian women.

AB  - We examined whether physical activity (PA) influences the association between birth weight and serum leptin in adolescents. The study comprised a total of 538 adolescents (315 girls), aged 12.5-17.49 years, born at term (>= 37 weeks of gestation). We measured serum leptin levels and time engaged in moderate-vigorous PA (MVPA) by accelerometry. There was an interaction effect between birth weight and meeting the PA recommendations (60 min/day MVPA) on leptin levels in girls (P = 0.023) but not in boys (P = 0.809). Birth weight was negatively associated with leptin levels in girls not meeting the PA recommendations (i.e. more than 60 min/day of MVPA) (beta = -0.096, P = 0.009), whereas no significant association was observed in those meeting the PA recommendations (beta = -0.061, P = 0.433). In conclusion, meeting the PA recommendations may attenuate the negative effect of low birth weight on serum leptin levels in European female adolescents. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study examined the effect of ponderal index (PI) at birth on the relationships between eight common polymorphisms of the leptin (LEP) and leptin receptor (LEPR) genes and adiposity in adolescents. A total of 823 European adolescents (45.4% girls) aged 14.8 +/- 1.4 years were genotyped for the LEP (rs2167270, rs12706832, rs10244329, rs2071045, and rs3828942) and LEPR (rs1137100, rs1137101, and rs8179183) polymorphisms. The PI was calculated from parental reports of birth weight and length. Fat mass index (FMI) was calculated. Analyses were adjusted for relevant confounders. An "adiposity-risk-allele score" based on genotypes at the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with adolescents' FMI in adolescents within the lower tertile of PI was calculated. The LEP rs10244329 and rs3828942 polymorphisms were associated with higher FMI only in adolescents within the lower PI tertile (+0.55 kg/m(2) per minor T allele, P = 0.040, and +0.58 kg/m(2) per major G allele, P = 0.028, respectively). The LEPR rs8179183 polymorphism was significantly associated with higher FMI in adolescents within the lower PI tertile (+0.87 kg/m(2) per minor C allele, P = 0.006). After correction for multiple comparisons, only the association between the LEPR rs8179183 and FMI persisted. However, each additional risk allele conferred 0.53 kg/m(2) greater FMI in adolescents within the lower tertile of PI (P = 0.008). In conclusion, our results suggest that those adolescents born with lower PI could be more vulnerable to the influence of the LEP rs10244329 and rs3828942 polymorphisms and LEPR rs8179183 polymorphism on total adiposity content. Due to the relatively small sample size, these findings should be replicated in further larger population samples.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that a lower birth weight, as an indicator of adverse intrauterine environment, is associated with higher serum leptin levels in European adolescents. We also examined the possible sexual dimorphism in this relationship., METHODS: Fasting serum leptin was measured in 757 European born at term adolescents (429 females) aged 14.6 +/- 1.2 yr. We measured weight and height, and body mass index was calculated. Birth weight, duration of pregnancy, and duration of breast-feeding were obtained from parental records. Duration of pregnancy and breast-feeding, pubertal status, center, body mass index, and physical activity were entered as confounders in the analyses., RESULTS: There was a significant interaction effect between sex and birth weight on serum leptin levels (P = 0.044). We observed that body weight at birth was negatively and significantly associated with serum leptin levels only in female adolescents (beta = -0.109; adjusted P = 0.008). The association persisted after further controlling for physical activity (beta = -0.115; adjusted P = 0.016)., CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further evidence for a sex-specific programming effect of birth weight on serum leptin levels. Our results also contribute to explain the detrimental health effects associated with lower birth weight, such as long-term increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin and adiponectin are two adipocytokines that play a critical role in the control of energy balance and metabolism as well as in conditions, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, and the development of the metabolic syndrome in adult life. Leptin has been associated with asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The aim of this study was to investigate the perinatal implication of leptin and adiponectin in IUGR. Design Leptin and adiponectin were measured in the plasma of 40 mothers, in the umbilical cord (UC) blood of their 20 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and 20 IUGR singleton, full-term fetuses, and neonates on day 1 (d1) and day 4 (d4) of life postnatally., METHODS: Serum leptin and adiponectin levels were measured by RIA. Serum cortisol levels were measured with an electrochemiluminescence immunoassay., RESULTS: Leptin and adiponectin serum levels were higher and lower respectively in IUGR (mean+/-s.e.m., 32.5+/-3.8 and 5.4+/-0.9 mug/l respectively) compared with AGA (20.4+/-2.1 and 11.8+/-1.3 mug/l respectively) mothers (P<0.05), although body mass index did not differ between these two groups. Leptin levels positively correlated with adiponectin levels in the AGA (r=0.547, P<0.05) but not in the IUGR mothers. UC, d1, and d4 leptin and adiponectin levels did not differ between IUGR and AGA groups. UC were significantly higher than d1 leptin levels (P<0.05) in the IUGR group but not in the AGA group., CONCLUSIONS: The increased UC leptin levels compared with d1 in IUGR fetuses might be directly and/or indirectly related to the subsequent development of insulin resistance in these neonates. This pathologic situation seems to be related to a specific profile of increased leptin and decreased adiponectin levels in IUGR mothers indicating a genetic predisposition for the development of insulin resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited evidence on how the classification of maternal metabolic syndrome during pregnancy affects children's developmental outcomes and the possible mediators of this association. This study uses a cohort sample of 12,644 to 13,832 mother-child pairs from the UK Born in Bradford Study to examine the associations between maternal metabolic syndrome classification (MetS) and child development outcomes at age 5, using cord blood markers as candidate mediators., METHODS: Maternal cardiometabolic markers included diabetes, obesity, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, hypertension, and fasting glucose during pregnancy. Cord blood markers of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, and adiponectin were used as child mediators. Child outcomes included two starting school variables: British Picture Vocabulary Scale (BPVS) and the Letter Identification Assessment (LID), and five developmental milestone domains from a national UK framework: (1) communication and language (COM); (2) personal, social, and emotional (PSE); (3) physical development (PHY); (4) literacy (LIT); and (5) mathematics (MAT). Mediation models were used to examine the associations between the classification of maternal metabolic syndrome and child developmental milestones. Models were adjusted for potential maternal, socioeconomic, and child confounders such as maternal education, deprivation, and gestational age., RESULTS: In mediation models, significant total effects were found for MetS associations with children's development in the LIT domain at age 5. MetS predicted individual cord blood mediators of lower HDL and increased leptin levels in both adjusted and unadjusted models. Total indirect effects (effects of all mediators combined) for MetS on a child's COM and PSE domain were significant, through all child cord blood mediators of LDL, HDL, triglycerides, adiponectin, and leptin for adjusted models., CONCLUSIONS: The results support the hypothesis that maternal metabolic syndrome classification during pregnancy is associated with some child developmental outcomes at age 5. After adjusting for maternal, child, and environmental covariates, maternal metabolic syndrome classification during pregnancy was associated with children's LIT domain through direct effects of maternal metabolic health and indirect effects of cord blood markers (total effects), and COM and PSE domains via changes only in a child's cord blood markers (total indirect effects).

AB  - The prevalence of adult obesity has risen markedly in recent decades. The endocrine system precisely regulates energy balance, fat abundance and fat deposition. Interestingly, white adipose tissue is an endocrine gland producing adipokines, which regulate whole-body physiology, including energy balance and reproduction. Endocrine disruptor chemicals (EDCs) include natural substances or chemicals that affect the endocrine system by multiple mechanisms and increase the risk of adverse health outcomes. Numerous studies have associated exposure to EDCs with obesity, classifying them as obesogens by their ability to activate different mechanisms, including the differentiation of adipocytes, increasing the storage of triglycerides, or elevating the number of adipocytes. Moreover, in recent years, not only industrial deception and obesity have intensified but also the problem of human infertility. Reproductive functions depend on hormone interactions, the balance of which may be disrupted by various EDCs or obesity. This review gives a brief summary of common EDCs linked with obesity, the mechanisms of their action, and the effect on adipokine levels, reproduction and connected disorders, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome, decrease in sperm motility, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction in females and decrease of sperm motility in males.

AB  - Introduction: Preterm infants are more likely than full-term babies to acquire obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease later in life. Preterm babies have higher total fat mass or adiposity compared to term babies, in addition to higher visceral fat as a percentage of total body fat storage. Adipose tissue is metabolically active, and the fat cells that make up this tissue secrete a class of bioactive substances known as adipokines. Methodology: For 100 infants born preterm and 100 infants born full-term, a chart review was done. We measured the baby's weight at birth, length, waist size, and hospital discharge weight (WC). The body mass index (BMI), ponderal index, and width to length ratio (WLR) were calculated. According to birth weight (BW), preterm newborns were divided into quartiles (Q1-Q4). Result(s): As comparison to preterm infants in higher BW quartiles or full-term infants, preterm neonatal 2 in the lowest BW quartile (Q1) had considerably shorter mean length, WC, WLR, BMI, and ponderal index at birth. Although their weight, length, and BMI remained significantly below term infants, preterm infants in Q1 experienced a disproportionate increase in WLR and ponderal index. As a result, at discharge, their WLR and ponderal index were higher than infants in Q2-3, similar to infants in Q4, and greater than full-term newborns. Discharge WLR and ponderal index increased in Q1 in addition to a decrease in postmenstrual age at delivery. Conclusion(s): We describe normative birth data for WLR and PI in preterm and full-term neonates according to gestational age and gender. WLR and ponderal index grow disproportionately in premature infants with lower birth postmenstrual ages.Copyright © 2023, Dr Yashwant Research Labs Pvt Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Maternal vitamin deficiencies are associated with low birth weight and increased perinatal morbidity and mortality. We hypothesize that maternal folate and/or vitamin B-12 restrictions alter body composition and fat metabolism in the offspring. Female weaning Wistar rats received ad libitum for 12 weeks a control diet (American Institute of Nutrition-76A) or the same with restriction of folate, vitamin B-12 or both (dual deficient) and, after confirming vitamin deficiency, were mated with control males. The pregnant/lactating mothers and their offspring received their respective diets throughout Biochemical and body composition parameters were determined in mothers before mating and in offspring at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Vitamin restriction increased body weight and fat and altered lipid profile in female Wistar rats, albeit differences were significant with only B-12 restriction. Offspring born to vitamin-B-12-restricted dams had lower birth weight, while offspring of all vitamin-restricted dams weighed higher at/from weaning. They had higher body fat (specially visceral fat) from 3 months and were dyslipidemic at 12 months, when they had high circulating and adipose tissue levels of tumor necrosis factor a, leptin and interleukin 6 and low levels of adiponectin and interleukin 1 beta. Vitamin-restricted offspring had higher activities of hepatic fatty acid synthase and acetyl-CoA-carboxylase and higher plasma cortisol levels. In conclusion, maternal and pen-/postnatal folate and/or vitamin B-12 restriction increased visceral adiposity (due to increased corticosteroid stress), altered lipid metabolism in rat offspring perhaps by modulating adipocyte function and may thus predispose them to high morbidity later.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Birth weight and leptin seem to be the factors responsible for early programming of body weight in later life. A marker for leptin action is free leptin index (FLI), which depends on soluble leptin receptor (Ob-Re) (FLI = leptin/Ob-Re). In the present article, we suggest that FLI is modulated partly by cortisol variations observed in newborns in the first days of life and is connected with their postnatal weight loss., METHODS: The study group consisted of 44 full-term newborns. Leptin, cortisol and Ob-Re concentrations were determined in the umbilical cord blood (UCB) and in the newborns' blood (NB) on the fourth day of life, free leptin index (FLI = leptin/Ob-Re) was calculated. Correlations between the assessed parameters and the somatic features of the newborns were examined., RESULTS: Birth weight, length and chest circumference of newborns were positively correlated with leptin concentration in the UCB but not with FLI in the UCB. Cortisol and leptin concentrations, as well as FLI values declined concomitantly with body weight, and were lower on the fourth day of life than on the first one; however, Ob-Re concentration increased (p < 0.0001). There was a positive correlation between the newborns' birth weight loss percentage evaluated on the fourth day of life and FLI in newborns (R = 0.39; p < 0.01). Positive correlations between cortisol and Ob-Re in UCB (R = 0.35; p < 0.02) and in NB (R = 0.36; p < 0.01), as well as a negative correlation between cortisol and FLI (R = -0.32; p < 0.03) in NB were noted., CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest a possible relationship between cortisol and a soluble leptin receptor (Ob-Re), which changes free leptin index (FLI) and is connected with birth weight loss in newborns. Whether these observations are important for programming of future body weight of children requires further research.

AB  - AIM: Resistin is believed to play a certain role in the pathogenesis of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of the study was to assess resistin concentrations in women with diet-treated GDM and good glycemic control, in healthy pregnant women and in cord blood, depending on the advancement of the pregnancy, maternal body mass index (BMI) and index of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), as well as on somatic features of the newborns., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 20 women with GDM whereas 20 healthy women constituting the control group. They were examined twice: at 23-32 weeks and at 35-37 weeks of gestation. Serum resistin concentration was assessed using RIA method., RESULTS: In the control group, maternal resistin concentration was higher (p<0.03) after the second examination than the first one. In the GDM group, maternal resistin concentration was similar to that in the control group in both examinations. No correlations were found either between maternal resistin and insulin concentrations or between maternal resistin concentration and BMI or HOMA-IR. No correlations were found between maternal resistin concentration or cord blood resistin concentration and somatic features of newborns, either. In both groups, resistin concentration in cord blood was higher than in maternal blood during both examinations., CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that maternal resistin concentration increases as pregnancy advances. In women with diet-treated GDM and good glycemic control resistin concentration is similar to that observed in healthy pregnant women. No relationship was found between resistin concentration in cord blood and somatic features of the newborns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Organophosphate esters (OPEs) are synthetic chemicals used as flame retardants and plasticizers in a variety of goods. Despite ubiquitous human exposures and laboratory evidence that prenatal OPE exposures may disrupt offspring metabolism, perinatal studies of OPE health effects are limited. The objectives of this study were to: 1) Determine predictors and reproducibility of urinary OPE biomarker concentrations during pregnancy, and 2) Estimate the relation of prenatal OPE exposures with birth outcomes and cord blood adipokine and insulin concentrations., METHODS: We analyzed five OPE metabolites in urine samples collected at up to three visits during pregnancy from 90 women enrolled in the ORigins of Child Health And Resilience in Development (ORCHARD) pregnancy cohort in Baltimore, MD from 2017 to 2019. To quantify the variability of metabolite concentrations during pregnancy, we calculated intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for each metabolite using mixed effects regression models. Using self-reported questionnaire data collected during gestation, we assessed possible sociodemographic and environmental/behavioral predictors of each OPE metabolite using generalized estimating equations to account for repeated exposure measures. We ascertained birth outcomes of 76 offspring from medical records, including weight-for-gestational age, length, ponderal index, and gestational age. In a subset of 37 infants, we measured cord blood concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, and insulin. To account for repeated exposure measures, we used linear structural equation models to assess the relations of standard deviation (SD) increases in prenatal OPE metabolite factor scores with continuous birth outcomes and cord blood biomarker concentrations., RESULTS: ICCs ranged from 0.09 for isopropylphenyl-phenyl phosphate (ip-PPP) to 0.59 for bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP). We observed little consistency in environmental or behavioral predictors of OPE exposures, although concentrations were generally lower for samples collected in the afternoon compared to morning and winter compared to other seasons. In adjusted analyses, a SD increase in BDCIPP concentration was associated with a 0.06 g/cm3 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.12) greater ponderal index. A SD increase in BDCIPP was associated with a 0.37 (95% CI: - 0.62, - 0.13) SD lower insulin concentration and 0.24 (95% CI: - 0.39, - 0.08) SD lower leptin concentration. Other OPEs were not associated with infant outcomes., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest some OPEs may be metabolic disruptors warranting investigation in larger studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: IGF-I receptor (IGF1R) plays an essential role in human intrauterine and postnatal development. Few heterozygous mutations in IGF1R leading to IGF-I resistance and intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation have been described to date., OBJECTIVE: The clinical and functional relevance of a novel heterozygous IGF1R mutation identified in a girl with short stature and six relatives was evaluated., PATIENTS: Affected individuals showed birth lengths between -1.40 and -1.82 sd score (SDS) and birth weights between -1.84 and -2.19 SDS. Postnatal growth retardation ranged between -1.51 and -3.93 height SDS. Additional phenotypic findings were variable including microcephaly, clinodactyly, delayed menarche, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Genetic analyses were initiated due to elevated IGF-I levels of the girl., RESULTS: Denaturing HPLC screening and direct DNA sequencing revealed a heterozygous G3464C IGF1R mutation in exon 19 located within a phylogenetically conserved motif of the kinase domain. The resultant mutation of glycine 1125 to alanine (G1125A) did not affect IGF1R protein expression in transiently transfected COS-7 cells and Igf1R deficient mouse fibroblasts but abrogated IGF-I-induced receptor autophosphorylation and phosphorylation of downstream kinases protein kinase B/Akt and MAPK/Erk (mouse proteins are reported). Cotransfection of wild-type and mutant IGF1R resulted in reduced autophosphorylation of 36 +/- 10% of wild-type levels, suggesting a partial dominant-negative effect., CONCLUSION: The identified G1125A mutation results in a kinase-deficient IGF1R, which is likely to cause the phenotype of intrauterine and postnatal growth retardation.

AB  - Excess body weight confers a high risk to human health. Body weight variation between subjects can be partially explained by genetic differences. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of genetic variants in the ADIPOQ (rs2241766) and LEP (rs7799039) genes with body weight trajectories in children from birth to 6 years of age. This was a prospective cohort (PREDI Study). Socio-economic, biological and anthropometric data were collected at four time points: at birth in the maternity unit; 1-2, 4-5 and 6 years old at the participants' homes. Genotyping was performed by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Poisson regression and linear mixed-effect regression models were used to address the association of ADIPOQ and LEP genotypes with BMI. Excessive body weight at pre-pregnancy (beta = 0.339, P = 0.01) and excessive gestational weight gain (beta = 0.51, P < 0.001) were associated with children's BMI trajectory from birth to 6 years. The ADIPOQ-rs2241766 TG or GG genotype was associated with a higher risk of excess body weight in the first 6 years of life (both sexes relative risk 1.25, 95 % CI 1.01, 1.56; female relative risk 1.67, 95 % CI 1.20, 2.31). BMI increased over the years according to the presence of the TG or GG genotype (beta = 0.01, 95 % CI 0.01, 0.02), particularly in females (beta = 0.02, 95 % CI 0.01, 0.04). The ADIPOQ-rs2241766 TG and GG genotypes increased the risk of excess body weight in children from birth to 6 years of age and had a positive effect on body weight trajectories in girls. The LEP-rs7799039 genetic variant was not associated with body weight trajectory in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The main objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the ADIPOQ rs2241766, LEP rs7799039, and FTO rs9939609 polymorphisms on the birth weight status of Brazilian infants., METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted in southern Brazil. Large for gestational age (LGA) newborns (n = 105), and the same number of small for gestational age/adequate for gestational age newborns, were included. Genotyping of the rs2241766, rs7799039, and rs9939609 polymorphisms was done by PCR-RFLP analysis. Logistic regression was used to investigate the association between LGA newborns and the presence of the polymorphisms., RESULTS: Infants carrying the GG genotype of the rs7799039 polymorphism were 2.12 times more likely to be born LGA than those carrying the GA + AA genotypes (95% CI: 1.17-3.83). These results did not change substantially after adjusting for potential confounding variables (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.05-3.73) and adjustment for the three polymorphisms (OR = 1.98; 95% CI 1.05-3.74). Regarding the ADIPOQ polymorphism, newborns carrying the TG or GG genotype were 1.88 times more likely to be born LGA than those carrying the TT genotype, although this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.082). No association was found between the FTO gene polymorphism and newborn weight status., CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the GG genotype of the LEP polymorphism rs7799039 is a risk factor for LGA infants. The exact role and mechanism of action of the GG genotype of this polymorphism in weight status control remain to be elucidated, and more studies are needed. Copyright © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - CONTEXT: Lifestyle interventions have not efficaciously reduced complications caused by maternal weight on fetal growth, requiring insight into explanatory mediators., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that maternal mediators, including adiponectin, leptin, insulin, and glucose, mediate effects of pregestational BMI (pBMI) and gestational weight gain (GWG) on birthweight and neonatal fat mass percentage (FM%) through placental weight and fetal mediators, including insulin levels (Ifv) and venous-arterial glucose difference (DELTAGfva). Hypothesized confounders were maternal age, gestational age, and parity., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of healthy mother-offspring-pairs (n = 165) applying the 4-vessel in vivo sampling method at Oslo University Hospital, Norway. We obtained pBMI, GWG, birthweight, and placental weight. FM% was available and calculated for a subcohort (n = 84). We measured circulating levels of adiponectin, leptin, glucose, and insulin and performed path analysis and traditional mediation analyses based on linear regression models., RESULTS: The total effect of pBMI and GWG on newborn size was estimated to be 30 g (range, 16-45 g) birthweight and 0.17 FM% (range, 0.04-0.29 FM%) per kg.m-2 pBMI and 31 g (range, 18-44 g) and 0.24 FM% (range, 0.10-0.37 FM%) per kg GWG. The placental weight was the main mediator, mediating 25-g birthweight and 0.11 FM% per kg.m-2 pBMI and 25-g birthweight and 0.13 FM% per kg GWG. The maternal mediators mediated a smaller part of the effect of pBMI (3.8-g birthweight and 0.023 FM% per kg.m-2 pBMI) but not GWG., CONCLUSION: Placental weight was the main mediator linking pBMI and GWG to birthweight and FM%. The effect of pBMI, but not GWG, on birthweight and FM%, was also mediated via the maternal and fetal mediators. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - The perinatal period is a time of substantial bone mass accrual with many factors affecting long-term bone mineralization. Currently it is unclear what effect maternal gestational/type 2 diabetes has on infant bone mass accrual. This is a prospective study of offspring of Native American and Hispanic mothers with normoglycemia (n = 94) and gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes (n = 64). Infant anthropometrics were measured at birth, 1, and 6 months of age. Cord blood leptin, high-molecular weight adiponectin (HMWA), pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF), vascular epithelium growth factor (VEGF), endoglin, and C-peptide were measured by ELISA. Infants had bone mineral density measurement at 1 month or/and 6 months of age using dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scan. Mothers with diabetes were older (31 +/- 6 years vs 25 +/- 4 years) and had higher pre-pregnancy BMI (32.6 +/- 5.8 vs 27.2 +/- 6.4 kg/m2) than control mothers. Mean HbA1C of mothers with diabetes was 5.9 +/- 1.0% compared to 5.1 +/- 0.3% in controls early in pregnancy. Infants born to mothers with diabetes (DM-O) were born at a slightly lower gestational age compared to infants born to control mothers (Con-O). There was no difference in total body less head bone mineral content (BMC) or bone mineral density (BMD) between DM-O and Con-O. For both groups together, bone area, BMD, and BMC tracked over the first 6 months of life (r: 0.56, 0.38, and 0.48, respectively). Percent fat was strongly and positively correlated with BMC at 1 month of age (r = 0.44; p < 0.001) and BMC at both 1 and 6 months of age correlated strongly with birth weight. There were no associations between infant bone mass and cord blood leptin, PEDF, or VEGF, while C-peptide had a significant correlation with BMC at 1 and 6 months only in DM-O (p = 0.01 and 0.03, respectively). Infants born to mothers with well-controlled gestational/type 2 diabetes have normal bone mass accrual. Bone mineral content during this time is highly correlated with indices of infant growth and the association of bone mineral indices with percent body fat suggests that bone-fat crosstalk is operative early in life.

AB  - We aimed to evaluate the role of the soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), the major leptin-binding protein in blood, for the regulation of growth and development of neonates. Therefore, human arterial and venous cord blood samples were taken from newborns of 45 healthy mothers to investigate correlations with anthropometric data. Furthermore, we compared changes in sOB-R and leptin in neonatal serum between postnatal d 1, 3, and 5. Cord blood levels of leptin (direct correlation) and the molar sOB-R/leptin ratio (inverse correlation) correlated significantly (P < 0.05) with weight, triceps, biceps, iliacal, and subscapular skinfolds at birth as well as on d 3 and 5 of life. During the first week of life, median leptin levels decreased significantly (P < 0.001) from 3.4 ng/ml in venous cord blood to 2.2 ng/ml in venous blood on d 1 after birth to 0.88 ng/ml on d 3 and 0.75 ng/ml on d 5. In contrast and most interestingly, median levels of sOB-R increased significantly (P < 0.001) from 14.5 ng/ml in cord blood to 18.9 ng/ml on d 1, 83 ng/ml on d 3, and 79.4 ng/ml on d 5. Consequently, the molar sOB-R/leptin ratio increased from 0.45 to 1.30 (d 1), 10.5 (d 3), and 13.7 (d 5) during the same period (P < 0.001). We found a remarkable postnatal change in the leptin-sOB-R axis with decreasing leptin and increasing sOB-R levels. Hence, the sOB-R may block leptin function by its competition with the membrane receptor for the ligand. These suppressive effects may be an important stimulus for energy uptake in the first week of life or in other conditions with a high energy demand.

AB  - Leptin, a recently discovered hormone that is involved in the regulation of body weight, appears to be one of the hormonal factors that signal the body's readiness for sexual maturation and reproduction to the brain. The present review focuses on clinical and experimental studies that describe the roles of maternal and foetal leptin as predictive factors for the physiological and pathophysiological development of the foetus during pregnancy, assisted reproduction and neonatal life. Through evaluating alterations of maternal serum leptin levels, a physiological hyperleptinaemia has been observed to occur, particularly during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, which is not associated with a decreased food intake or reduced metabolic activity in the pregnant women. This state of leptin resistance is comparable to the condition in obesity. In contrast, hypoleptinaemia is suggested to be an indicator for the cessation of pregnancy, either naturally at term or as a result of pathology at any time during gestation. Thus, an appropriate maternal leptin level seems to be a prerequisite for a normal pregnancy. The main source of foetal leptin is the still immature foetal adipose tissue. As intrauterine growth has been found to be independently associated with cord blood leptin level, it has been suggested that leptin plays a role as a regulator of foetal growth. During assisted reproduction cycles leptin levels in the follicular fluid of patients may be also of predictive value, with low levels predicting therapeutic failure. Finally, the relevance of leptin to postnatal development is reviewed; leptin may be important for regulation of satiety and peripheral metabolism. In summary, leptin appears to be an important permissive factor that is involved in female reproduction.

AB  - Compelling epidemiological and animal experimental data demonstrate that cardiometabolic and neuropsychiatric diseases originate in a suboptimal intrauterine environment. Here, we review evidence suggesting that altered placental function may, at least in part, mediate the link between the maternal environment and changes in fetal growth and development. Emerging evidence indicates that the placenta controls the development and function of several fetal tissues through nutrient sensing, modulation of trophoblast nutrient transporters and by altering the number and cargo of released extracellular vesicles. In this Review, we discuss the development and functions of the maternal-placental-fetal interface (in humans and mice) and how cross-talk between these compartments may be a mechanism for in utero programming, focusing on mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), adiponectin and O-GlcNac transferase (OGT) signaling. We also discuss how maternal diet and stress influences fetal development and metabolism and how fetal growth restriction can result in susceptibility to developing chronic disease later in life. Finally, we speculate how interventions targeting placental function may offer unprecedented opportunities to prevent cardiometabolic disease in future generations. Copyright © 2023.

AB  - Objective Rapid weight gain in the first 3 months of life has been associated with an unfavourable cardio-metabolic phenotype in adulthood. However, little is known about the antepartum determinants of this rapid weight gain, which may reflect key developmental exposures that program metabolic pathways. Thus, we sought to characterize the antepartum determinants of rapid weight gain in the first 3 months of life in infants exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), a patient population at risk for early cardio-metabolic disease. Design Prospective observational cohort study. Patients Pregnant women with (n = 90) and without GDM (n = 250) underwent detailed antepartum metabolic characterization, followed by assessment of their term offspring at age 3 months. Measurements Rapid infant weight gain in the first 3 months was defined as weight gain >= 0.5 SD. Results No features of maternal metabolic function in pregnancy (including insulin sensitivity, lipid profile, adiponectin, leptin and C-reactive protein) were associated with infant weight gain in either the GDM or non-GDM group. Interestingly, although all infants were born at term (>= 37 weeks), length of gestation was inversely associated with weight gain at 3 months in the infants of women with GDM (beta = -148.5, P = 0.01). In these infants, length of gestation <39 weeks was an independent predictor of rapid weight gain (OR = 7.9, 95% CI 1.7-38, P = 0.009) in the fully adjusted model. These associations were not observed in infants of women without GDM. Conclusions Delivery before 39 weeks is independently associated with rapid weight gain in the first 3 months of life in term infants of women with GDM and hence may be an antepartum marker of future cardio-metabolic risk.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prematurity is associated with increased cardiometabolic risk later in life. The adipomyokine irisin has been acknowledged as a modulator of energy metabolism and insulin sensitivity. The aim of this study was to investigate circulating levels of irisin and their relation to anthropometric measurements and cardiometabolic phenotype in a population of preterm-born children versus full-term-born peers., METHODS: A total of 160 children (87 born preterm aged 8.1-14.8 years and 73 born full-term of similar age and gender distribution) were studied. Arterial blood pressure, anthropometry, body composition assessments with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and skinfold measurements were performed. Blood biochemistry and circulating levels of irisin, insulin, cortisol, leptin, and adiponectin were also determined., RESULTS: The preterm group had higher diastolic blood pressure, triceps skinfold, subscapular skinfold (SSSF), and abdominal skinfold measurements and more central adiposity than the full-term group. Irisin was significantly lower (p = 0.002), whereas leptin was higher (p = 0.03) in the preterm than the full-term group. Irisin correlated positively with gestational age (r = 0.19, p = 0.01), birth weight (r = 0.23, p = 0.003), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.20, p = 0.01) and negatively with SSSF (r = -0.25, p = 0.003) and chronological age (r = -0.21, p = 0.008)., CONCLUSION: Lower levels of irisin and a slightly unhealthy adiposity and cardiometabolic pattern were detected in preterm-born children in comparison to their full-term-born peers. Whether low irisin levels in preadolescents and adolescents born prematurely could be of prognostic value for the development of cardiometabolic sequelae later in life remains to be further studied.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine plasma adiponectin concentrations during perinatal the period and their correlations with fetal anthropometric parameters and other hormones., DESIGN: Venous cord blood samples were obtained from 59 full-term healthy newborns (36 males and 23 females, gestational age 37.0-41.4 weeks, birth weight 2,146-4,326 g, birth length 44.0-54.5 cm). The blood samples were also obtained from 15 neonates (postnatal day 3-7) whose cord blood had already been collected and the changes in adiponectin concentrations were examined., MEASUREMENTS: The adiponectin concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The leptin concentration was determined by radioimmunoassay. Insulin, GH and IGF-1 concentrations were determined by immunoradiometric assays., RESULTS: The plasma adiponectin concentrations in cord blood ranged from 6.0 to 55.8 microg/ml (median 22.4 microg/ml), which were much higher than those in normal-weight adults (P < 0.0001). In contrast to the findings in adults, these values were positively correlated with birth weight (r = 0.43, P = 0.0005), body mass index (r = 0.44, P = 0.0005), birth weight/birth length ratio (r = 0.46, P = 0.0002) and the leptin concentrations (r = 0.39, P = 0.004). When the effects of fat mass-related anthropometric parameters such as the birth weight/birth length ratio were controlled, plasma adiponectin concentrations had a significant inverse correlation with insulin concentrations (r = -0.35, P = 0.01). There was no significant gender difference in adiponectin concentrations among newborns. The adiponectin concentrations in neonates (postnatal day 3-7) did not change significantly compared with those in cord blood., CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to the findings in adults, these results suggest that the adiponectin concentration increases with the mass of fetal fat.

AB  - AIMS: Maternal leptin affects placental growth hormone (GH), whereas ghrelin, a natural ligand of the growth-hormone-secretagogue receptor, modulates GH action. Both hormones may affect fetal growth, and dysregulation in diabetes may lead to fetal growth disturbances. The aim was to investigate changes in maternal ghrelin during pregnancy with diabetes and to establish reference leptin levels., METHODS: Twelve healthy non-diabetic (ND) and 12 pregnant women with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) were recruited. Age and body mass index (BMI) [ND: age 29.9 +/- 4.7 years (mean +/- sd), BMI 25.2 +/- 3.7 kg/m2; T1DM: age 31 +/- 5.5 years, BMI 27 +/- 3.1 kg/m2] were similar in the groups. HbA1c in T1DM was 6.2 +/- 1.1% at 20 weeks, 6.3 +/- 1.1% at 30 weeks' gestation and 7.8 +/- 2.1% postpartum. Fasting plasma ghrelin, total leptin, free leptin (FL) and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels were measured at 20 and 30 weeks' gestation and postpartum and determined by radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: All pregnancies resulted in full-term singleton births with no differences in birth weight between groups [T1DM: 3.4 +/- 0.56 kg (mean +/- SE); ND: 3.6 +/- 0.3 kg, P = NS]. Ghrelin levels were lower in T1DM when corrected for age and mothers' weight (T1DM: 458 +/- 36 pg/ml and 432.9 +/- 26.6 pg/ml; ND: 562 +/- 52 pg/ml and 515.8 +/- 63 pg/ml at 20 and 30 weeks, respectively, P < 0.05). T1DM mothers had higher levels of sOB-R and FL levels declined at 30 weeks' gestation in T1DM (P = 0.04) but not in ND., CONCLUSION: In a population of pregnant women with expected changes in leptin levels as previously reported, ghrelin levels were lower in T1DM pregnancies at 20 and 30 weeks. This may have implications for fetal development and requires further study in diabetes, particularly in pregnancies that result in macrosomia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Airway inflammation is involved in the pathogenesis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The aim of the study was to evaluate the inflammatory activity in plasma and exhaled air in very low birth weight (VLBW) BPD survivors at school age., METHODS: Twenty-one 6-14-year-old former VLBW (birth weight <=1,500 g) children with severe radiographic BPD (radBPD), 19 without radBPD (nonBPD group) and 19 non-asthmatic term controls underwent measurement of eosinophil cationic protein, IL-6, IL-8, adiponectin, adipsin, leptin, and resistin in plasma, leukotriene B4 and 8-isoprostane in exhaled breath condensate, and NO in exhaled breath. Background data were obtained from patient records, clinical examination and parental questionnaire. Both univariate and multivariate models were applied in the statistical analysis., RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the groups in any of the inflammatory markers measured. Five (25%) radBPD and 2 (11%) nonBPD children reported asthma (P = 0.058). In logistic regression analysis, exposure to chorioamnionitis was associated with low IL-8 (OR 29.0, 95% CI 3.27-258) and postnatal corticosteroid therapy with high adiponectin (OR 32.0, 95% CI 1.29-793). High body mass index standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) was associated with high plasma adipsin (OR 2.47, 95% CI 1.07-5.75) and leptin (OR 5.76, 95%CI 1.83-18.2) levels., CONCLUSIONS: The inflammatory activity seems to decrease by school age in VLBW BPD survivors. Chorioamnionitis and postnatal corticosteroid treatment may modulate the inflammatory responsiveness in VLBW subjects even up to school age. The respiratory outcome in VLBW infants might be improved by preventing excessive weight gain. Copyright © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin and its soluble receptor (sOB-R) are important to regulation of body composition but there are no data on the developmental variations in these plasma variables and their relationship with body composition measurements,, METHODS: Weight, length, and body composition (bone, fat and lean mass) by dual energy absorptiometry, and plasma variables were measured in healthy infants at 2, 4, 8 and 12 months., RESULTS: 15 whites and 29 African Americans (21 males and 23 females) with mean birth weight 3357 +/- 45 (SEM) g and gestation of 39.3 +/- 0.17 weeks were studied. The overall Z score for weight, length and weight for length during the study were 0.00 +/- 0.15, -0.08 +/- 0.11 and 0.12 +/- 0.14 respectively. With increasing age, plasma leptin (1.0 to 18.2, median 5.5 ng/mL) and sOB-R:leptin molar ratio (10.1 to 247.4, median 59.9) were lowered (r = -0.47, p < 0.01; and r = -0.37, p < 0.05 respectively), best predicted by weight Z score and percentage of fat mass, and higher in African American and female. Presence of body composition measurements eliminated the race and gender effect on the plasma variables. Plasma sOB-R (49.5 to 173.9, median 81.3 ng/mL) did not change significantly with age and was correlated and predicted only by body composition measurements., CONCLUSION: In healthy growing infants, plasma leptin but not sOB-R decreases with age. Gender, race and anthropometric measurements are additional physiological determinants predictive of plasma leptin and the receptor:ligand ratio. However, body composition is the only variable that can predict plasma leptin and its soluble receptor and the receptor: ligand ratio; and body composition measurements eliminated the race and gender effect on these plasma variables.

AB  - Various groups of factors play a role in the development of excessive body weight and obesity: Genetic, environmental (nutrition, physical activity), pathological (metabolic and hormonal disturbances, alterations in body fat amount and composition as well as in the secretion of adipocytokines, impaired regulation by hypothalamic centers controlling appetite and satiety), psychological (eating disorders, consumption of food as a response to stress or depression) as well as other factors not yet clarified to date which are also likely to have a bearing. The aim of the study was to determine and analyze the risk factors responsible for the occurrence of excessive body weight in a representative population of high school pupils aged 16-19 in the town of Plovdiv. Material(s) and Method(s): An observational cross-section study was carried out on a randomized sample of 633 pupils (343 boys and 290 girls) aged 16-19 (Table 1). The study involved an interview and anthropometric evaluation of the pupils based on relevant clinical measurements, followed by recording of the body composition indices determined by a TANITA BC-420 bio-impedance analyzer. The categories of overweight and obesity were determined in relation to the body mass index (BMI) according to WHO criteria. An original questionnaire developed by the authors included a number of indices related to the social and economic status, family and health status, dietary regimen and physical activity of the study participants. Result(s): Factors correlating significantly with BMI in both sexes: Family history for diabetes mellitus, obesity, arterial hypertension (in total and individually for each disease), body mass (kg and %), muscle mass (kg), muscle mass (%) (inverse correlation), water content (kg), water content (%) (inverse correlation), impedance (inverse correlation), metabolic age, basal metabolism, waist circumference (cm), hip circumference (cm), waist/hip ratio, arterial blood pressure-systolic and diastolic, pulse rate, intentional low calorie diet in the last 3 months and daily water consumption. Factors correlating significantly with BMI in boys only: Age, weight at birth, family history for thyroid pathology, attending a specific high school, physical activity (frequency and duration combined) (inverse correlation), breakfast and alcohol consumption (inverse correlations). Factors correlating significantly with BMI in girls only: Presence of a concomitant disease such as menstrual disturbances and hirsutism. Conclusion(s): The risk factors for overweight in adolescents in real life in our country must be analyzed in order to determine the possibilities of their impact and the prevention of obesity with the development of complications and the occurrence of associated diseases in adulthood.Copyright © 2019 Medical Information Center.

AB  - Adiponectin has been associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus and possibly fetal growth. Our aim was to assess the association between the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) and the birth sizes. We investigated four SNPs of ADIPOQ (rs182052, rs2241766, rs1501299, and rs266729) and birth height and weight in 237 healthy full-term neonates. The neonates with the rs182052 G allele had a greater birth weight (p = .043 in the dominant model) and a higher ponderal index (p = .028 in the additive model). The rs2241766 G allele was associated with a greater birth weight (p = .016 in the recessive model). In a logistic regression analysis, the homozygotes for the rs182052 G allele and those for the rs2241766 G allele showed a significant association with a greater birth weight above 90 percentile (OR 2.75, 95% CI 1.13-6.70 and OR 5.15, 95% CI 1.66-15.99, respectively). In conclusion, we found an association between rs182052 and rs2241766 and birth weight and ponderal index among healthy neonates and suggested that adiponectin might have some roles in fetal growth.

AB  - The developmental origins of health and disease (DOHaD) hypothesis is that future lifestyle diseases in offspring are associated with intrauterine origins in the mother; stress during pregnancy is a risk factor for these diseases in offspring. This study aimed to clarify association of maternal stress with placental dysfunction and offspring development in mice. We applied water stress for 24 h during late pregnancy to explore the metabolic response of offspring to a normal diet (ND) and high-fat diet (HFD). Placental functions were altered by maternal stress, reducing the birth weight of the offspring. In the later life of offspring fed with ND, maternal stress impaired systemic glucose tolerance and altered adipokine secretion in adipose tissue and/or liver. The female offspring of stress-induced dams were light in body weight with lower adipose tissue and smaller adipocytes in both the ND and HFD groups. Abnormal situations, such as dysregulation of plasma glucose levels and fatty liver despite and lower increases in body weight, were observed in the female offspring of stress-induced dams, especially in the HFD-treated group. These findings suggest that long-lasting abnormal conditions and responses to metabolic challenges in maternal stress-induced offspring are linked to placental dysregulation and fetal programming.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic complication, which leads to short and long-term consequences in both mother and fetus exposed to hyperglycemia. The aetiology of this condition is proposed to be based on the dysfunction of the adipose tissue, which is characterised by the aberrant generation of adipokines. One of them is preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1), which could mediate controlling the adaptation of the maternal metabolism to pregnancy., AIMS: The study aims to examine the level of Pref-1 in the cord blood of healthy pregnant women's neonates and fetuses born to mothers with GDM., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cord blood samples were collected from 30 newborns of mothers with GDM and 40 newborns of healthy pregnant women. Pref-1 concentrations were measured with an ELISA kit., RESULTS: Fetal Pref-1 concentrations were significantly lower in newborns of mothers with GDM compared to the normal pregnancy group children (5.32 +/- 0.29 vs. 7.38 +/- 0.53; p < 0.001). Mothers with GDM had a significantly higher index of BMI before pregnancy, maternal gestational weight gain, and maternal fasting glucose. In-depth analysis through multiple variant linear regression revealed a significant association between fetal serum Pref-1 levels, exposure to GDM, and gestational age., CONCLUSION: These findings contribute valuable insights into maternal-fetal health and pave the way for more targeted and effective clinical interventions.

AB  - This paper is a summary of results obtained in our studies on leptinemia in patients with chronic renal failure treated with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO), in kidney transplant patients, in patients with essential hypertension, and in pregnant women with preeclampsia. In this study, we found that rHuEPO treatment has a suppressive effect on leptinemia in patients with endstage renal failure. These results suggest that the appetite stimulating effect of rHuEPO may be mediated by a reduction of leptin synthesis and release. At the early stage of successful kidney transplantation, a significant decline of leptinemia was noticed, which was not related either to the excretory function of the graft or the kind and dose of immunosuppressants. In kidney transplant patients with grafts functioning well for 2.5 years, significantly elevated leptinemia was found. From these results, we may conclude that factors other than the excretory function of the graft and the kind and dosage of immunosuppressants may be involved in the pathogenesis of abnormal leptinemia in these patients. Both in normotensive subjects and patients with essential hypertension, a positive correlation was found between leptinemia and mean blood pressure, suggesting that leptin may be involved in the regulation of blood pressure. Both healthy and preeclamptic pregnant women show higher leptinemia than nonpregnant women. In preeclamptic women, leptin levels in maternal vein blood, umbilical cord blood, and amniotic fluid were significantly higher than respective values found in healthy pregnant women. In contrast to healthy pregnant and nonpregnant women, in women with preeclampsia, no correlation was found between the body mass index (BMI) and leptinemia. In preeclamptic women the abnormally elevated leptinemia was not related to blood pressure. Finally, no correlation was found between leptinemia in maternal and umbilical cord blood. From these studies, it follows that the elucidation of abnormal leptin secretion in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia needs further study.

AB  - Leptin is presumed to be related to body mass index (BMI) and body fat stores and is involved together with neuropeptid Y (NPY) in the regulation of appetite. As pregnancy is accompanied both by changes of BMI and appetite, performance of studies presented in this paper were fully justified. In 43 healthy pregnant women and in 18 pregnant women with mild or moderate EPH-gestosis, concentrations of leptin and NPY were estimated in maternal venous blood, umbilical cord blood and in amniotic fluid. The control group consisted of 26 healthy nonpregnant women. Healthy nonpregnant women showed a BMI of 23.08+/-0.65 kg/m2 which was significantly lower than in healthy pregnant women (26.9+/-0.4 kg/m2, p < 0.001) and in women with EPH-gestosis (29.7+/-0.9, p < 0.0001). Also in healthy pregnant women the BMI was significantly lower than in EPH-gestosis subjects (p < 0.001). In healthy nonpregnant women plasma leptin levels were significantly lower than in healthy pregnant and EPH-gestosis women (10.9+/-1.68 vs 14.99+/-1.28 vs 21.89+/-2.58 ng/ml, respectively). In umbilical cord blood plasma leptin levels were significantly lower than in maternal blood only in healthy pregnant women (7.37+/-0.69 vs 14.99+/-1.28 ng/ml) but not in EPH-gestosis subjects (18.06+/-3.38 vs 21.89+/-2.58 ng/ml). Leptin levels in amniotic fluid were significantly lower than in umbilical cord blood both in healthy pregnant women (2.25+/-0.20 vs 7.37+/-0.69 ng/ml) and EPH-gestosis women (6.58+/-2.62 vs 18.06+/-3.38 ng/ml). In EPH-gestosis women leptin levels were significantly higher than in healthy pregnant women in maternal blood (21.89+/-2.58 vs 14.99+/-1.28 ng/ml), umbilical cord blood (18.06+/-3.38 vs 7.37+/-0.69 ng/ml) and amniotic fluid (6.58+/-2.62 vs 2.25+/-0.2 ng/ml). In both examined pregnant groups plasma NPY levels were nonsignificantly lower in healthy pregnant and EPH-gestosis women (42.28+/-4.09 and 43.68+/-8.45 pg/ml, respectively) than in nonpregnant women 50.65+/-6.13 pg/ml). In normal pregnancy a significantly higher NPY level was found in umbilical cord blood as compared with respective values in EPH-gestosis women (116.28+/-17.0 vs 49.65+/-7.01 pg/ml). Finally in both examined groups of pregnant women the amniotic fluid NPY level was of similar magnitude (13.85+/-1.52 and 13.89+/-2.46 pg/ml in healthy pregnant and EPH-gestosis women respectively). No significant correlation was found between fetal birth weight and cord-serum leptin and NPY levels respectively.

AB  - Neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) are associated with reduced concentrations of IGF-I that might contribute to arterial wall thickening. Direct atherogenic effects of leptin have been described. We aimed to investigate the relationship among abdominal aortic intima-media thickness (aIMT), serum IGF-I, IGF binding protein-3, and leptin levels in neonates with IUGR. Abdominal aIMT was measured in 40 term neonates with IUGR and in 40 controls. Mean aIMT was significantly greater in neonates with IUGR (0.45 +/- 0.03 mm) than in controls (0.39 +/- 0.04 mm, p < 0.0001). Serum IGF-I and leptin levels were lower in neonates with IUGR than in controls. There was a significant positive correlation between aIMT and gestational age, whereas a significant negative correlation was determined between aIMT and IGF-I in the IUGR neonates. For aIMT, significant associations included serum IGF-I level (beta = -0.406, p = 0.006) and gestational age (beta = 0.331, p = 0.022) in a multiple stepwise linear regression analysis. In control neonates, serum IGF-I levels were negatively related to aIMT (beta = -0.750, p < 0.001). Neonates with IUGR have significant aIMT with decreased IGF-I. IGF-I levels determine aIMT not only in neonates with IUGR but also in healthy controls.

AB  - Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are at a higher risk for metabolic disorders later in life. In this study, we aimed to characterize young SGA children without catch-up growth and evaluate the effects of GH treatment on endocrinological, metabolic, and immunological parameters. Study design is a one-year single hospital-based study included prospective observation of SGA patients during 12 months of GH treatment. Clinical and laboratory profiles of SGA children at baseline were compared with controls born appropriate size for age. Twenty-six SGA children (median age, 3.4 years) and 26 control children (median age, 3.8 years) were enrolled. Anthropometric, hematologic, biochemical, immunological, and endocrinological parameters were assessed at baseline and 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after the start of GH treatment. As a result, median height SD score (SDS) of SGA children increased by +0.42 with 12-month GH treatment. Body mass index SDS was lower in SGA children than in controls. Serum apolipoprotein A1 increased, whereas apolipoprotein B decreased during GH treatment. Serum leptin and resistin levels, which were lower in SGA children than in controls at baseline, did not change remarkably with GH treatment. Monocyte counts, which were lower in SGA patients at baseline, increased after GH treatment. Neutrophil counts significantly increased after GH treatment. Natural killer cell ratios, which were higher in SGA patients, decreased after GH treatment. In conclusion, there was no evidence suggesting metabolic abnormalities in SGA children. Serum apolipoprotein changes might predict the beneficial role of GH treatment in lowering cardiometabolic risk.

AB  - Leptin is an adipocyte-derived peptide hormone regulating energy balance in experimental animals. Although the physiological function of leptin in humans is still unclear, its secretion is closely related to fat mass in adult humans. To examine how fetal growth correlates with leptin levels at birth, an umbilical cord venous blood sample was obtained at the delivery from 50 term newborn infants. Twenty-eight of the newborn infants had birth weights appropriate for gestational age (AGA; mean +/- SEM, 3362 +/- 90 g; relative birth weight, -0.08 +/- 0.2 SD), 9 were large for gestational age (birth weight, 4655 +/- 165 g; relative birth weight, 3.2 +/- 0.3 SD; P < 0.001 vs. AGA newborn infants), and 13 were small for gestational age (SGA; birth weight, 2385 +/- 69 g; relative birth weight, -2.2 +/- 0.08 SD; P < 0.001 vs. AGA newborn infants). Leptin concentrations were higher in large for gestational age (35.7 +/- 8.0 micrograms/L; P < 0.005), but lower in SGA (3.3 +/- 0.5 micrograms/L; P < 0.001) than in AGA infants (14.5 +/- 2.8 micrograms/L). When adjusted for differences in body weight, mean leptin levels were similar in the three newborn groups. Leptin concentration correlated closely with both absolute and relative birth weights (r = 0.71; P < 0.001 in both), with cord blood insulin concentration (r = 0.67; P < 0.001), and with placental weight (r = 0.60; P < 0.001). These data suggest that leptin is synthesized in utero, and that the circulating leptin concentration relates to the intrauterine growth pattern.

AB  - There has been an increase in prevalence of both obesity and bronchial asthma in recent decades. In numerous epidemiological studies obesity has been shown to be an important risk factor for asthma. Prospective longitudinal studies demonstrate that obesity precedes asthma, suggesting a causal relation. Moreover, obesity worsens asthma control, and weight reduction measures can improve existing asthma. Epidemiological studies demonstrated that maternal overweight as well as high birth weight are proven risk factors for preschool wheezing, whereas evidence for their effect on asthma in later childhood is much weaker. School age overweight clearly influences asthma incidence in childhood and adolescence, and this effect extends until adulthood at least for females. The underlying mechanisms is multifactorial, and are yet not fully understood. An increased systemic inflammatory state mediated by factors (so-called adipokines) derived from adipose tissue plays an important role. Adipokines influence pulmonary inflammation, T cellular response and bronchial reactivity via different inflammatory mediators. Besides that mechanical alterations in the airways and comorbidities of obesity such as obstructive sleep apnoe syndrome and gastroesophageal reflux contribute to asthma manifestation. Because a gender effect can be detected hormonal influences have to be assumed as well. Acknowledging the role of obesity in asthma development is important because it allows for preventive measures and therapeutical interventions.

AB  - The present study was carried out to compare serum levels of leptin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), homeostasis model assessment--(pancreatic beta-cell function) (HOMA-(%B)) and homeostasis model assessment--(tissue insulin sensitivity) (HOMA-(%S)) in women with mild and severe pre-eclampsia and normotensive pregnant women; and to evaluate the possible relationships between these parameters in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. Seventy-three women were divided into three groups: group A consisted of 20 normotensive pregnant women (NPW); group B consisted of 25 women with mild pre-eclampsia (MPE); and group C consisted of 28 women with severe pre-eclampsia (SPE). Serum level of leptin was measured by enzyme immunoassay using a commercial kit. Serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured with a two-site immunoradiometric assay. Serum level of insulin was measured by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method. HOMA used indices of pancreatic beta-cell function and tissue insulin sensitivity. Differences between groups were compared by one-way analyses of variance and the post hoc Tukey-HSD test for multiple comparisons; however, when a variable was not normally distributed, the Mann-Whitney U test was used. Associations between variables were tested using Pearson's coefficient of correlation. Birth weight was significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the MPE and SPE groups than in the NPW group. Serum levels of leptin and insulin in women with SPE and MPE were significantly higher (p < 0.001) than in NPW. Serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were significantly lower in women with SPE and MPE compared with NPW (p < 0.001). The mean HOMA-(%B) level in women with SPE and MPE was significantly higher than in NPW (p < 0.001), whereas the mean HOMA-(%S) level in women with SPE and MPE was significantly lower than in NPW (p < 0.001). In the SPE group, systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with serum levels of IGF-I and leptin (r = 0.375, p < 0.05 and r = 0.495, p < 0.01, respectively). A negative correlation between mean HOMA-(%S) level and serum IGFBP-3 level was noted (r = -0.357, p < 0.05). There was a positive correlation between serum level of IGF-I and mean HOMA-(%B) level in mildly pre-eclamptic women (r = 0.541, p < 0.01). We conclude that pre-eclampsia is associated with insulin resistance; and that existing hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance in women with pre-eclampsia seem not to correlate with leptin and birth weight, but may correlate positively with IGF-1 and IGFBP-3. Therefore we think that hyperleptinemia, low IGF-I or IGFBP-3, and insulin resistance may contribute to the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the past decades, the obesity epidemic in children of all ages has been an important research field for detecting the metabolic causes and consequences of obesity, the major focus being on insulin and adipocytokine levels. Metabolic work-up in obese children is recommended in the age group as young as 2-6 years. There is evidence that birth weight can be a factor causing obesity later in life accompanied by metabolic complications., METHODS: Insulin, leptin, and adiponectin levels were analyzed in 269 obese children and 60 controls, as well as 110 newborn children with different birth weight and different length of gestation, using standard methods., RESULTS: In 53.6% of the obese children, complications of obesity such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, heart attack or stroke were found in family members. The peak insulinemia on OGTT was significantly higher in the pubertal compared to the prepubertal group (110.5+/- 75.9 muU/mL versus 72.2+/-62.7 muU/mL) (p<0.005). Glucose intolerance was confirmed in 24%. The leptin level was significantly higher and the adiponectin level was lower in pubertal obese children compared to the prepubertal children and controls (p<0.05). In newborns the leptin and adiponectin levels were in correlation with anthropometric parameters: body weight (BW), body length (BL), BW/BL, BMI, and the pondered index (p<0.05)., CONCLUSION: Obese children have high insulinemia in all ages, reaching its peak towards puberty. The leptin and adiponectin levels might be indicators of the metabolic syndrome. Our findings in newborns might influence the nutritional approach in the future in order to prevent complications of obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Leptin (LEP) is a vital placental hormone that is known to affect different aspects of placental function and fetal development. The present study aimed to determine the association of placental LEP transcript abundance with maternal, placental, and newborn parameters., SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this retrospective case-control study, placental samples (n = 105) were collected from small (SGA) and appropriate (AGA) for gestational age full-term singleton pregnancies (n = 44 SGA and n = 61 AGA). Placental transcript abundance of LEP was assessed by real-time quantitative PCR after normalization to a reference gene panel. LEP methylation was measured using a quantitative MethyLight assay in a subset of samples (n = 54)., RESULTS: Placental LEP transcript abundance was negatively and significantly associated with placental weight (beta = -3.883, P = 0.015). This association continued to be significant in the SGA group (beta = -10.332, P = 0.001), both in female (beta = -15.423, P = 0.021) and male births (beta = -10.029, P = 0.007). LEP transcript abundance was not associated with LEP methylation levels (Spearman's rho = 0.148, P = 0.287)., CONCLUSION: We conclude that placental upregulation of LEP is an integral and fetal sex-independent component of placental growth restriction, which can be potentially targeted through maternal dietary modifications to improve fetoplacental growth.

AB  - Adiponectin and leptin are involved in appetite control and body weight regulation. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between breast milk adipokine levels and short-term growth of preterm and term infants. Thirty-one preterm (median=35.3 weeks) and 34 term (median=38.7 weeks) infants were enrolled. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to detect adipokines in mature milk. Infant growth was followed during the first 3 months. Although weight gain in the first month was insufficient, positive linear growth was observed in the following months for preterm infants, while term infants had positive steady linear growth. The median level of adipokines was found to be higher in preterm infants (P>0.05). Adiponectin showed significant negative correlations with some anthropometric measurements of term infants. However, in preterm infants, adiponectin was negatively correlated with length increment and positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) increment in the second-third month. In addition, leptin was negatively associated with the head circumference at birth in preterm infants and the triceps skinfold thickness increment in the first-second month term infants (P<0.05). In linear regression models, while gestational age, adiponectin and leptin were not related, maternal age and pre-pregnancy BMI had effects on body weight increment in 0-1 months (P<0.05). In conclusion, adiponectin may affect short-term growth, while leptin has no important effect. It would be beneficial to carry out longitudinal studies to evaluate the effects of these adipokines on the growth of infants.

AB  - The melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4R) is a member of the seven membrane-spanning G protein-coupled receptor superfamily and signals through the activation of adenylyl cyclase. The MC4R mutations are the most common known monogenic cause of human obesity. However, no such mutations have been found in Japanese obese subjects. Here we report a novel homozygous missense mutation of MC4R (G98R) in a nondiabetic Japanese woman with severe early-onset obesity, which is located in its second transmembrane domain. Her birth weight was 3,360 g, and she gained weight progressively from 10 months of age. At 40 years of age, her weight reached 160 kg and a BMI of 62 kg/m(2). Her parents, who are heterozygous for the mutation, have BMIs of 26 and 27 kg/m(2). In vitro transient transfection assays revealed no discernable agonist ligand binding and cAMP production in HEK293 cells expressing the mutant receptor, indicating a severe loss-of-function mutation. This study represents the first demonstration of a pathogenic mutation of MC4R in Japan and will provide further insight into the pathophysiologic role of the hypothalamic melanocortin system in human obesity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE Intrauterine exposure to maternal type 1 diabetes is associated with a less favorable metabolic profile later in life. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is the hepatic manifestation of a cluster of metabolic abnormalities linked to insulin resistance. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of maternal pregestational type 1 diabetes on the presence of fatty liver in offspring and the association between maternal BMI, glycemic control during pregnancy, offspring metabolic risk factors, and offspring level of soluble CD163 (sCD163) (a marker of macrophage activation) and risk of fatty liver. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS This study was a prospective nationwide follow-up study of offspring (n = 278) of mothers with pregestational type 1 diabetes between 1993 and 1999 and matched control subjects (n = 303). Mean age at the time of follow-up was 16.7 years (range 13.0-20.4 years). We used the fatty liver index (FLI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) to evaluate the presence of fatty liver among the offspring. An FLI >= 60 or WHtR >0.469 were used as cutoff points for fatty liver. RESULTS More type 1 diabetes-exposed offspring had high FLI and WHtR indices compared with unexposed control subjects. We found significant associations between increasing maternal prepregnancy BMI, being born large for gestational age, offspring level of sCD163, as well as offspring metabolic risk factors (decreasing adiponectin and HDL cholesterol and increasing leptin, HOMA of insulin resistance, and HOMA of insulin secretion) and degree of fatty liver. CONCLUSIONS Intrauterine exposure to maternal type 1 diabetes and higher maternal prepregnancy BMI may predispose to fatty liver in the offspring. Offspring metabolic risk factors, including sCD163 levels, are associated with indices of fatty liver.

AB  - Primary arterial hypertension (HT) in children occurs significantly more often than once assumed. It is the main form of HT in children over 12 years old and is prevalent in the obese. It has been proved that birth weight influences the blood pressure development during the developmental age. According to recent data the percentage of overweight and obese children is rising drastically. It has been proved that the weight gain is accompanied by the increase in blood pressure (1 mmHg per each kilogram gained). Impaired glucose tolerance, disturbances of lipid metabolism, increase in cardiac output, sympathetic and rennin-angiotensin-aldosterone systems' activation, sodium and water retention are caused by excessive development of fatty tissue (especially visceral fat), and these factors support development of HT and early atheromatous lesions. Autopsy studies of children and young individuals in the Bogalusa Heart Study provided important information. Strict dependence between weight gain, systolic pressure, lipid disturbances, smoking and progression of atheromatous changes in the aorta and coronary arteries has been proven. These studies indicate occurrence of atherosclerosis in children and the young with risk factors predisposing to the development of atherosclerosis. Identification of CVD risk factors, constituting the metabolic syndrome (HT and obesity are integral parts of this syndrome) in children, is a subject of numerous currently performed researches. In the recent years researches have shown that adipocytes display significant endocrine and paracrine activity. Biologically active substances (influencing blood pressure regulation) secreted by these cells include among others: leptin, adiponectin, Agouti protein, visfatin, resistin, as well as TGF-beta, TNF-alpha, PAI-1, angiotensinogen, rennin, convertase of the angiotensin, chimase, DIG catepsine, prostaglandin, IGF-1, VEGF, MIF, IL-6, sex hormones (testosterone, estradiol, estrone), glicocortycosteroids. Damage of arterial endothelium and oxidative modification of LDL molecules initiate the atheromatous process. Long-term increase in blood pressure is associated with mechanical injuries of the endothelium. The so-called shear stress, resulting from blood flow, leads to secondary activation of inflammatory process intensifying the atheromatosis. Diagnostics of HT causes in obese children with consideration of factors supporting the development of atherosclerosis (standard HT diagnostics, diagnostic of blood vessel conditions - IMT and vessel vasodilatation capability, evaluation of lipid metabolism and the level of glucose utilization and plasma antioxidant capability, evaluation of the so-called new CVD risk factors - levels of homocysteine, CRP, prothrombotic factors) is currently of great significance in primary CVD prophylaxis. Pharmacotherapy, but most importantly non-pharmacological methods of treatment aiming to modify the lifestyle (weight loss, increase in physical activity, dietary conduct, quitting smoking) are of specific significance in obese children suffering from HT.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin levels measured in neonatal dried blood spot samples (DBSS) might be affected by both prematurity and being born small for gestational age (SGA). The aim of the study was to measure adiponectin levels in routinely collected neonatal DBSS taken on day 5 (range 3-12) postnatal from infants., DESIGN: A retrospective case-control study., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: One hundred and twenty-two infants: 62 very premature (34 SGA) and 60 mature infants (27 SGA). Adiponectin concentrations were determined in stored neonatal DBSS using a sandwich immunoassay based on flow metric Luminex xMap technology., RESULTS: Adiponectin was measurable in all samples, and repeated measurements correlated significantly (r = 0.94). Adiponectin concentrations were negatively associated with both SGA (B = -0.283, P = 0.04) and prematurity (B = -2.194, P < 0.001), independently of each other. In the premature but not the mature group, adiponectin levels increased with increasing postnatal age at blood sampling (B = 0.175, P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Reliable quantification of adiponectin in stored DBSS is feasible and may be used to study large populations of routinely collected samples. Low levels of adiponectin in neonatal DBSS are associated with SGA as well as prematurity. Blood adiponectin levels increase with postnatal age in premature infants, suggesting a rapid yet unexplained metabolic adaptation to premature extrauterine life.

AB  - In recent years, the investigation of peptide and protein-structured hormones in biological fluids has become one of the most striking issues. The aim of this study was to determine irisin, asprosin, leptin, adiponectin, and IGF-1 levels in cows and calves after calving according to the mode of delivery. The study was carried out with 20 Holstein cows and 20 calves born from these cows. Blood samples were taken from cows and calves in all groups during birth, after drinking colostrum from calves and on the 15th, 30th, 45th and 60th days after birth in 10 ml tubes. The levels of the aforementioned molecules in these blood samples were determined by ELISA method. Feeding with colostrum led to a decrease in the irisin levels in the dystocia and cesarean section groups and in the IGF-1 levels in the vaginal delivery group, but it did not lead to any other significant changes. The irisin levels of the calves in the vaginal delivery group were compared to those in the other groups, and their levels were found to decrease on the 15th day, and IGF-1 levels were higher on the 15th day. As a result, it was revealed that there were significant changes in the levels of these molecules in the umbilical cord and blood serum of cows and calves depending on the mode of delivery.

AB  - AIM: This study examined the relationship between hypothalamic-associated hormones and behavioural and eating disorders in children with low birthweight., METHODS: We included 100 children (mean age 9.7 years): 39 were born preterm at <32 gestational weeks, 28 were full-term, but small for gestational age, and 33 were full-term controls. Behavioural histories were analysed, together with fasting blood samples of leptin, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), prolactin, glucagon and cortisol., RESULTS: Preterm children had lower prolactin (p = 0.01) and higher IGF-I than controls (p < 0.05, adjusted for confounders), despite being significantly shorter than the predicted target height (p < 0.001). More preterm children displayed behavioural disorders (38% versus 10%, p < 0.001) and eating disorders (26% versus 8%, p < 0.05) than full-term children. These disorders were associated with lower leptin (p < 0.01), insulin (p < 0.05) and IGF-I (p < 0.05), but correlations between these hormones and leptin were similar among the groups. Combined behavioural and eating disorders were only observed in preterm children, who were also the shortest in height., CONCLUSION: Behavioural and eating disorders among preterm children were associated with low leptin, insulin and IGF-1. Low prolactin in all preterm children indicated an increased dopaminergic tonus, which might inhibit body weight incrementation. This raises speculation about IGF-I receptor insensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) are at risk for developing type 2 diabetes. Lipodystrophy leads to early type 2 diabetes and leptin reverses the metabolic consequences of the disease. Low IGF-binding protein 1 (IGFBP1) can predict the development of type 2 diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine leptin, insulin, and IGFBP1 in children and adult women born preterm or SGA to evaluate the role of leptin as a compensatory mechanism in insulin resistance development., METHODS: Seventy-six children (8.5-10 years, 41 girls and 35 boys) and 45 women (23-30 years) were studied. The children comprised subjects born appropriate for gestational age (<30 gestational weeks) (n=22), born SGA at term (n=23), and full-term normal-weight controls (n=31). Among the women, the corresponding figures were, n=10, n=18, and n=17 respectively. Fasting levels of IGFBP1, leptin, insulin, and IGF1 were determined and total adiponectin only in women., RESULTS: In girls and women, term SGA subjects had higher leptin levels in relation to BMI SDS (P=0.042 and P=0.03 respectively). More than half of IGFBP1 variability was explained by leptin and insulin in children. In term SGA women, IGFBP1 level was lower compared with controls (P=0.012) and the regression line of IGFBP1 on insulin was suppressed below -1 s.d. of a reference material., CONCLUSION: Leptin levels were elevated in term SGA girls and women, in particular in adult women, but not found in preterm girls and women. IGFBP1 was lower in term SGA women. In children, leptin and insulin were strong suppressors of IGFBP1. We speculate that higher leptin levels could be a protective event to enhance hepatic insulin sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hokkaido Study on Environment and Children's Health is an ongoing study consisting of two birth cohorts of different population sizes: the Sapporo cohort and the Hokkaido cohort. Our primary objectives are to (1) examine the effects that low-level environmental chemical exposures have on birth outcomes, including birth defects and growth retardation; (2) follow the development of allergies, infectious diseases, and neurobehavioral developmental disorders, as well as perform a longitudinal observation of child development; (3) identify high-risk groups based on genetic susceptibility to environmental chemicals; and (4) identify the additive effects of various chemicals, including tobacco., METHODS: The purpose of this report is to provide an update on the progress of the Hokkaido Study, summarize recent results, and suggest future directions. In particular, this report provides the latest details from questionnaire surveys, face-to-face examinations, and a collection of biological specimens from children and measurements of their chemical exposures., RESULTS: The latest findings indicate different risk factors of parental characteristics on birth outcomes and the mediating effect between socioeconomic status and children that are small for the gestational age. Maternal serum folate was not associated with birth defects. Prenatal chemical exposure and smoking were associated with birth size and growth, as well as cord blood biomarkers, such as adiponectin, leptin, thyroid, and reproductive hormones. We also found significant associations between the chemical levels and neuro development, asthma, and allergies., CONCLUSIONS: Chemical exposure to children can occur both before and after birth. Longer follow-up for children is crucial in birth cohort studies to reinforce the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease hypothesis. In contrast, considering shifts in the exposure levels due to regulation is also essential, which may also change the association to health outcomes. This study found that individual susceptibility to adverse health effects depends on the genotype. Epigenome modification of DNA methylation was also discovered, indicating the necessity of examining molecular biology perspectives. International collaborations can add a new dimension to the current knowledge and provide novel discoveries in the future.

AB  - To investigate leptin and to which factors it is related during the perinatal period, we measured serum leptin levels of 46 mothers at delivery, umbilical cord blood and infants on the third day of life. Maternal leptin was higher than in cord (p < 0.001), and did not correlate with maternal age, body weight, body mass index, weight gain during pregnancy, serum glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, CPE, cortisol or HbA1c levels, nor any biochemical values or anthropometric data of the newborns (p > 0.05). In cord blood, leptin was significantly higher than in 3 day-old infants (p < 0.05), and correlated only with maternal insulin and glucose (r = 0.5, p < 0.01 and r = 0.4, p < 0.05, respectively). In 3 day-old infants, leptin did not correlate with any clinical data (p > 0.05). Leptin was not different in the two sexes (p > 0.05). Serum leptin levels were not related to adiposity of the mother-infant pairs or neonatal growth, and were not different in the two sexes during the perinatal period.

AB  - CONTEXT: Offspring birthweight is inversely associated with future maternal cardiovascular mortality, a relationship that has yet to be fully elucidated. Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are thought to play a key role in vasculogenesis, and EPC numbers reflect cardiovascular risk., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to ascertain whether EPC number or function was reduced in mothers of low-birthweight infants., DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective cohort study in a general antenatal department of a university maternity hospital., PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three mothers of small for gestational age (SGA) infants (birthweight < 10th centile) and 23 mothers of appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants (birthweight >= 10th centile) were recruited., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Maternal EPC number and function, conventional cardiovascular risk markers, and cord blood adiponectin were measured., RESULTS: Median EPC count was lower (294 vs. 367, P = 0.005) and EPC migration was reduced (0.91 vs. 1.59, P < 0.001) in SGA compared with AGA infants, with no difference in EPC adhesion (0.221 vs. 0.284 fluorescence units, P = 0.257). Maternal triglyceride levels were higher in SGA than AGA infants (0.98 vs. 0.78 mmol/liter, P = 0.006), but there was no difference in cholesterol, glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin, adiponectin, or blood pressure. There was a moderate monotone (increasing) relationship between birthweight and umbilical cord blood adiponectin (r = 0.475, P = 0.005)., CONCLUSION: Giving birth to an SGA infant was associated with lower maternal EPC number and reduced migratory function. Cord blood adiponectin was significantly correlated with birthweight.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Leptin is a protein hormone mainly produced by the adipocytes. Apart from its autocrine role within the placenta in humans, plasma circulating leptin contributes to the endocrine function. Leptin levels may serve as an index of metabolic and energy balance in pregnancy. Recent reports have shown a positive correlation between leptin concentrations and plasma levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA(1c)) in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to evaluate leptin levels after delivery in GDM and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) women., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Plasma leptin concentration and insulin, c-peptide and glycated haemoglobin were measured in both. NGT women and in patients with a history of GDM in all patients total LDL - and HDL cholesterol concentrations were estimated. We also calculated the anthropometric parameters of the mother and birth weight in both groups., RESULTS: The plasma leptin concentration after delivery was not different in patients with GDM in comparison with the NGT individuals., CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that in patients with GDM and normal BM1 the postpartum leptin level was not different in comparison with the NGT patients.

AB  - Iron supplementation is recommended during pregnancy and fetal growth. However, excess iron exposure may increase the risk of abnormal fetal development. We investigated the potential side effects of high iron levels in fetuses and through their adult life. C57BL/6J pregnant mice from 2 weeks of gestation and their offspring until 30 weeks were fed a control (CTRL, FeSO4 0 g/1 kg) or high iron (HFe, FeSO4 9.9 g/1 kg) diets. HFe group showed higher iron accumulation in the liver with increased hepcidin, reduced TfR1/2 mRNAs, and lowered ferritin heavy chain (FTH) proteins in both liver and adipose tissues despite iron loading. HFe decreased body weight, fat weight, adipocyte size, and triglyceride levels in the blood and fat, along with downregulation of lipogenesis genes, including PPAR gamma, C/EBP alpha, SREBP1c, FASN, and SCD1, and fatty acid uptake and oxidation genes, such as CD36 and PPAR alpha. UCP2, adiponectin, and mRNA levels of antioxidant genes such as GPX4, HO-1, and NQO1 were increased in the HFe group, while total glutathione was reduced. We conclude that prolonged exposure to high iron from the fetal stage to adulthood may decrease fat accumulation by altering ferritin expression, adipocyte differentiation, and triglyceride metabolism, resulting in an alteration in normal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low birthweight is associated with insulin resistance later in life, and adiponectin is known to play an important role in insulin resistance. We have investigated whether birthweight has a relationship with adiponectin levels in adolescence., PATIENTS: An at-home questionnaire survey was completed by 660 middle-school students (aged 12-15 years) in Seoul, Korea, and 152 participants were selected randomly based on their birthweight. MEASUREMENTS Subjects were separated into three groups according to birthweight. We recorded the birthweight and measured anthropometric factors including blood pressure, lipid profile, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-beta), and adiponectin levels of the subjects. These parameters were compared among the groups. The relationship between birthweight and physiological characteristics in adolescence was examined., RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure, lipid profiles and fasting plasma glucose were not significantly different among the groups, but diastolic blood pressure was lower in the third tertile. Insulin, C-peptide and HOMA-IR were higher in the low birthweight tertile. After adjustment for confounding factors, birthweight was inversely related to diastolic blood pressure, insulin, C-peptide and HOMA-IR. Adiponectin level had a significant relationship with current body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.291; P< 0.001) but not with birthweight (r = 0.117; P = 0.166). CONCLUSIONS P: Although birthweight is closely related to insulin resistance during adolescence, adiponectin levels during adolescence had no significant relationship with birthweight. This result implies that low birthweight may not permanently affect adiponectin levels, but current body size is more closely associated with a decreased adiponectin level. However, the limited importance of birthweight as a determining factor on the adiponectin level later in life needs to be further evaluated.

AB  - A large body of clinical data, supported by genetic and pharmacological evidence, has demonstrated potent insulin-sensitizing effects of the adipocyte-derived secretory factor adiponectin. In adults, plasma adiponectin is generally negatively correlated with BMI and positively correlated with systemic insulin sensitivity. Only a limited number of studies have been performed in newborns, children and adolescents. Here we summarize the results from these recent findings in younger cohorts and discuss these results in context of the much vaster literature on adiponectin levels in lean, obese and diabetic adults.

AB  - Adipose tissue serves as a source of adipokines and cytokines with both local and systemic actions in health and disease. In this study, we examine the hypothesis that multipotent human adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), capable of differentiating along the adipocyte, chondrocyte, and osteoblast pathways, contribute to adipose tissue-derived cytokine secretion. Following exposure to basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or epidermal growth factor (EGF), the ASCs significantly increase their secretion of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), a cytokine implicated in hematopoiesis, vasculogenesis, and mammary epithelial duct formation. Ascorbic acid synergizes with these inductive factors, further increasing HGF levels. Following exposure to lipopolysaccharide, ASCs increase their secretion of both hematopoietic (granulocyte/monocyte, granulocyte, and macrophage colony stimulating factors, interleukin 7) and proinflammatory (interleukins 6, 8, and 11, tumor necrosis factor alpha) cytokines based on ELISA and RT-PCR. In co-cultures established with umbilical cord blood-derived CD34(+) cells, the ASCs support long-term hematopoiesis in vitro. Furthermore, in short-term 12-day co-cultures, the ASC maintain and expand the numbers of both myeloid and lymphoid progenitors. These observations are consistent with the functionality of the secreted cytokines and confirm recent reports by other laboratories concerning the hematopoietic supportive capability of ASCs. We conclude that the ASCs display cytokine secretory properties similar to those reported for bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs).

AB  - The origins of adult disease are considered to relate to fetal undernutrition, and this concept is termed "developmental origins of adult health and disease" (DOHaD). Here, we describe several epidemiological studies performed in Japan and discuss whether DOHaD is applicable to children in present day Japan. In a study of healthy children and young adults, it was found that systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol and adiponectin were associated with birth weight. Hyperinsulinemia, high blood pressure, elevated transaminase levels and prevalence of metabolic syndrome in obese children were inversely correlated with birth weight and positively correlated with current weight and waist circumference. Birth weight was related to the development of type 2 diabetes in children. DOHaD is therefore considered to be applicable in Japan. The key considerations of DOHaD are the following two mismatches. The first mismatch pertains to growth and development in response to environmental influences, especially those of nutrition. The second mismatch pertains to the prenatal versus postnatal environment. We consider that the chance of children in present day Japan developing adult diseases is determined by the above mismatches. Pediatricians and schoolteachers should therefore understand the concept of DOHaD, so that they can educate both children and their families regarding an appropriate diet to reduce the likelihood of developing adult diseases in later life.

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) during pregnancy has been associated with adverse maternal outcomes. However, the effect of maternal OSA on fetal growth is less clear. The placenta is a critical organ for fetal growth and development and the principal determinant of birthweight. We aimed to investigate the effect of maternal OSA on placental growth and function., METHODS: Placentas of women recruited to a prospective longitudinal study were consecutively obtained immediately after delivery. Each placenta was measured for length, width, and thickness. Total RNA was isolated for gene expression analysis of VEGF, VEGF receptor, PIGF, and leptin. Histological and morphometric evaluations of the placenta were performed., RESULTS: A total of 53 placentas were investigated. Ten women (19%) had OSA, and the weight of their placentas was significantly higher compared with the placentas of the controls (526.1 +/- 83.9 vs. 425.7 +/- 95.5 g, p = 0.004). There was a significant positive correlation between placental weight and the log apnea-hypopnea index even after controlling for maternal body mass index (BMI; r = 0.31, p = 0.04). The birthweight/placental weight ratio was significantly lower in women with OSA compared with controls (p = 0.03). Placental weight and newborn triceps adiposity thickness correlated positively after controlling for maternal BMI (r = 0.29, p = 0.04). Leptin expression was 1.8-fold higher in placentas of women with OSA compared with controls (p = 0.02). No histological differences were found between the groups., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal OSA is associated with increased placental weight that correlated with OSA severity and neonatal adiposity independently of maternal BMI. Placental leptin overexpression may mediate/underlie the above findings.Trial Registration: Clinical Trials NCT00931099. Copyright © Sleep Research Society 2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: This study was aimed to investigate the association of maternal serum and breast-milk levels of macronutrients, hormones, growth factors, and maternal body composition with infant's body weight., SUBJECTS/METHODS: Eighty mother-infant pairs comprised 40 with overweight or obese infant and 40 with normal-weight infant were enrolled in this study. The level of ghrelin, Leptin, adiponectin, EGF, and IGF1 in plasma and breast milk were assessed. Daily breast milk intake and macronutrient concentration along with anthropometric indices of mother-infant pairs were also assessed., RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in concentrations of serum hormones between two groups (p > 0.05). However, hormones levels in maternal serum were higher than those in breast milk. A significant positive correlation was found between serum EGF and ghrelin (r = 0.57, p = 0 < 0001). Higher IGF1 in serum showed a significant association with its milk counterpart (r = 0.37). Current mother's weight was associated with infant's weight at the 2nd and 6th month (B = 0.023 p = 0.04, B = 0.055 p = 0.005). The breast-milk macronutrient content was not comparable between two groups. However, the average daily breast milk consumption in obese infants was higher than normals (p = 0.001). Milk EGF and leptin were related to a decrease of 59% and 46% the odds of obese infant development, respectively. There was a significant association of milk EGF and ghrelin with birth weight (B = -0.19, p = 0.04 and B = -0.2, p = 0.04, respectively), and also serum leptin with infant's body weight at the 6th month., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a positive association of maternal weight, daily breast milk intake, EGF, and ghrelin with infant's body weight.

AB  - The objective of the study was to analyse leptin, IGF-1, Apo A, lipoproteins, haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in maternal sera and venous umbilical cord sera of newborn babies of 25 preeclamptics (group II), and 25 normotensive pregnant women (group I) as markers of obesity and growth in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women. Apo A I and II levels were estimated by competitive immunoassay using direct chemiluminiscence technology. Haem oxygenase-1 (HO-1), leptin and IGF-1 were analysed by ELISA. Maternal and cord blood levels of homocysteine, folic acid, lipid profile (namely, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C, VLDL-C and HDL-C), Haem oxygenase 1 were higher in preeclamptic women as compared to normotensive pregnant women. Serum and cord blood Apo A-I and Apo B, leptin levels, IGF-I were lower in preeclamptic women as compared to normotensive pregnant. The findings of high serum HO-1 levels in maternal and cord blood in preeclampsia supports the role of oxidative stress and excessive inflammatory response in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. It seems likely that IGF-1 and leptin play a central role in controlling foetal growth. There is increasing evidence that the foundations of life-long health are, in part, laid in the uterus. Findings of present study suggest that alterations in biochemical markers of growth and obesity occur in mothers and foetuses and modifications of uterine environment can be of help to prevent future cardiovascular risk. Impact statement Preeclampsia has been reported to be associated with an increased risk of later life cardiovascular disease. However, information regarding how obesity increases the risk of preeclampsia is limited. Atherogenic milieu occurring during pregnancy persists into adulthood and foetal growth retardation is strongly associated with adult atherosclerosis. There is conflicting evidence regarding alterations of IGFs in preeclamptic pregnancies and deficit in circulating and cord blood IGF-1 levels in intrauterine growth restricted newborns and a correlation between IGF-1 levels and birth weight have been reported. Leptin is a predictor of cardiovascular risk independent of insulin resistance. Emerging evidence supports an important role for the haem oxygenase system (HO-1) in the maintenance of a healthy pregnancy, especially during pathological challenge. Conflicting data are available regarding HO-1, leptin and IGF -1 in preeclamptic mothers. The extent to which they mediate foetal growth and developmental abnormalities remains to be clarified. Serum IGF-1 levels were significantly decreased in preeclamptics and maternal IGF-1 showed a strong inverse correlation with leptin levels. High serum HO-1 levels in maternal and cord blood in preeclampsia were observed in the present study. Findings of the present study suggest that alterations in biochemical markers of growth and obesity occur in mothers and foetuses and modifications of the uterine environment can be of help to prevent future cardiovascular risk.

AB  - The present study was planned to assess IGF-1, leptin and cholinesterase levels in maternal blood of both normoglycaemics and hyperglycaemics preeclampsia. Twenty five normotensive pregnant women at the time of delivery were selected in as group I and sub grouped according to blood glucose less than or more than 85 mg/dL as I A (<85mg/dL) and I B (>85mg/dL). Study group (group II, n=25) comprised of preeclamptic women and was further divided into group II A (<85mg/dL) and group II B (>85mg/dL). Routine biochemical investigations along with IGF-1, leptin and cholinesterase levels were analyzed in maternal and cord blood of preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women. Serum IGF-1 levels were significantly lower in preeclamptic women and more so in those with hyperglycemia. Cord blood IGF-1 levels were nearly doubled in hyperglycemic preeclamptics as compared to normoglycemic preeclamptics. Leptin levels were higher in preeclamptic women and more in hyperglycemic preeclamptics. Cholinesterase levels were lowered in preeclamptic mothers and higher in hyperglycemics. Cord blood cholinesterase levels were reduced in preeclamptics, more so in hyperglycaemics as compared to group I. Diet recommendation, avoidance of excessive weight gain and healthy life style, exercise and nutritional interventions may be beneficial in these women.

AB  - Adiponectin, an adipokine, regulates metabolism and insulin sensitivity. Considering that the transplacental transfer of maternal proteins of high molecular weight is hindered in ruminants, this study tested the hypothesis that the blood concentration of adiponectin in neonatal calves largely reflects their endogenous synthesis whereby the intake of colostrum might modify the circulating concentrations. We thus characterized the adiponectin concentrations in neonatal and young calves that were fed either colostrum or formula. Three trials were performed: in trial 1, 20 calves were all fed colostrum for 3 d, and then formula until weaning. Blood samples were collected on d 0 (before colostrum feeding), and on d 1, 3, 11, 22, 34, 43, 52, 70, 90, and 108 postnatum. In trial 2, 14 calves were studied for the first 4 d of life. They were fed colostrum (n = 7) or formula (n = 7), and blood samples were taken right after birth and before each morning feeding on d 2, 3, and 4. In trial 3, calves born preterm (n = 7) or at term received colostrum only at 24 h postnatum. Blood was sampled at birth, and before and 2 h after feeding. Additionally, allantoic fluid and blood from 4 Holstein cows undergoing cesarean section were sampled. Adiponectin was quantified by ELISA. In trial 1, the serum adiponectin concentrations recorded on d 3 were 4.7-fold higher than before colostrum intake. The distribution of the molecular weight forms of adiponectin differed before and after colostrum consumption. In trial 2, the colostrum group had consistently greater plasma adiponectin concentrations than the formula group after the first meal. In trial 3, the preterm calves tended to have lower concentrations of plasma adiponectin than the term calves at birth and before and 2 h after feeding. Furthermore, the adiponectin concentrations were substantially lower in allantoic fluid than in the sera from neonatal calves and from cows at parturition. Our results show that calves are born with very low blood concentrations of adiponectin and placental transfer of adiponectin to the bovine fetus is unlikely. In conclusion, colostrum intake is essential for the postnatal increase of circulating adiponectin in newborn calves.

AB  - MicroRNAs are non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. In the placenta, the master regulator of foetal growth and development, microRNAs shape the basic processes of trophoblast biology and specific microRNA have been associated with foetal growth. To comprehensively assess the role of microRNAs in placental function and foetal development, we have performed small RNA sequencing to profile placental microRNAs from two independent mother-infant cohorts: the Rhode Island Child Health Study (n = 225) and the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (n = 317). We modelled microRNA counts on infant birthweight percentile (BWP) in each cohort, while accounting for race, sex, parity, and technical factors, using negative binomial generalized linear models. We identified microRNAs that were differentially expressed (DEmiRs) with BWP at false discovery rate (FDR) less than 0.05 in both cohorts. hsa-miR-532-5p (miR-532) was positively associated with BWP in both cohorts. By integrating parallel whole transcriptome and small RNA sequencing in the RICHS cohort, we identified putative targets of miR-532. These targets are enriched for pathways involved in adipogenesis, adipocytokine signalling, energy metabolism, and hypoxia response, and included Leptin, which we further demonstrated to have a decreasing expression with increasing BWP, particularly in male infants. Overall, we have shown a robust and reproducible association of miR-532 with BWP, which could influence BWP through regulation of adipocytokines Leptin and Adiponectin.

AB  - Maternal obesity is associated with pregnancy complications and increases the risk for the infant to develop obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular disease later in life. However, the mechanisms linking the maternal obesogenic environment to adverse short-and long-term outcomes remain poorly understood. As compared with pregnant women with normal BMI, women entering pregnancy obese have more pronounced insulin resistance, higher circulating plasma insulin, leptin, IGF-1, lipids and possibly proinflammatory cytokines and lower plasma adiponectin. Importantly, the changes in maternal levels of nutrients, growth factors and hormones in maternal obesity modulate placental function. For example, high insulin, leptin, IGF-1 and low adiponectin in obese pregnant women activate mTOR signaling in the placenta, promoting protein synthesis, mitochondrial function and nutrient transport. These changes are believed to increase fetal nutrient supply and contribute to fetal overgrowth and/or adiposity in offspring, which increases the risk to develop disease later in life. However, the majority of obese women give birth to normal weight infants and these pregnancies are also associated with activation of inflammatory signaling pathways, oxidative stress, decreased oxidative phosphorylation and lipid accumulation in the placenta. Recent bioinformatics approaches have expanded our understanding of how maternal obesity affects the placenta; however, the link between changes in placental function and adverse outcomes in obese women giving birth to normal sized infants is unclear. Interventions that specifically target placental function, such as activation of placental adiponectin receptors, may prevent the transmission of metabolic disease from obese women to the next generation.

AB  - Omentin is a novel adipocytokine expressed in visceral adipose tissue. Secretion and blood concentration of omentin decrease in the obese subjects. We previously demonstrated that omentin is anti-inflammatory in vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs). While vascular remodeling via migration of SMCs is also important for hypertension development, it remains to be clarified whether omentin affects this process. Here we examined whether omentin controls SMC migration. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 2 h) significantly inhibited platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-BB (10 ng/ml, 6 h)-induced migration of rat mesenteric arterial SMCs, as determined by Boyden chamber assay. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 2 h) significantly inhibited PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, 30 min)-induced phosphorylation of p38 and heat shock protein (HSP) 27. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 2 h) significantly inhibited PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml, 30 min)-induced NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation as determined by lucigenin assay. Omentin (300 ng/ml, 24 h) significantly inhibited fetal bovine serum (5%, 4 days)-induced SMC outgrowth from rat isolated mesenteric artery. In vivo, omentin significantly inhibited carotid intimal hyperplasia in mouse ligation model. In summary, we for the first time demonstrate that omentin prevents PDGF-BB-induced SMC migration by preventing NOX/O-2(-)/p38/HSP27 pathways, which might be at least partly responsible for the preventive effects on neointimal hyperplasia. Our data suggest that omentin may be protective against hypertension development by inhibiting vascular structural remodeling.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birth weight (BW), small head circumference, reduced length, increased preterm births and neuro-endocrine dysfunctions are among known consequences of smoking during pregnancy. Few studies have linked leptin to clinical features of growth restriction associated with maternal smoking and explored interaction with other determinants of size at birth, such as gender., METHODS: Cord serum leptin concentrations were measured in 1215 term infants born to Caucasian mothers at completion of uneventful pregnancy. Serum concentrations were related to BW, gestational length, gender and maternal smoking and interaction with other determinants of size at birth evaluated., RESULTS: Smoking was more frequent in younger (P<0.001) and shorter mothers (P=0.03) from lower socio-economic groups (SEGPs) (P<0.001). Infants born to smokers were lighter (190 g less), shorter and with smaller head circumference. Cord serum leptin concentrations were higher in girls (9.8 s.d. 7.6 ng/ml) than in boys (7.05 s.d. 5.8 ng/ml) (P<0.001). Boys were heavier (BW 3.52 s.d. 0.49 kg) than girls (3.39 s.d. 0.44 kg) (P<0.001), but girls had greater skinfold thickness measurements (sub-scapular and quadriceps skinfold thicknesses 5.5 s.d. 1.6 mm and 7.6 s.d. 1.9 mm respectively; boys 5.3 s.d. 1.6 vs 7.24+/-1.90 mm, P<0.001 respectively). Multivariate analyses showed gender (P<0.001), BW SDS (P<0.001), gestational length (P<0.001) and maternal smoking (P<0.042) as factors that influenced umbilical cord serum leptin concentrations in newborns., CONCLUSION: Maternal smoking restrains foetal growth through placental vascular effects, and likely also via associated effects on leptin metabolism. More studies are needed to determine the influence that maternal smoking may have on placental syncytiotrophoblast and foetal adipose tissue.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We examined whether maternal serum cytokine profiles of mothers with early-onset fetal growth restriction (FGR) were associated with delivery within 2 weeks after sampling during the third trimester., STUDY DESIGN: This exploratory prospective cross-sectional study included a total of 20 singleton fetuses with early-onset FGR and 31 healthy controls. Maternal serum samples during the early third trimester were analyzed for 23 cytokines., RESULTS: Of 20 fetuses with early-onset FGR, 14 had delivery within 2 weeks after sampling. Multivariate analysis revealed that maternal serum concentrations of soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sVEGFR-1) and soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L) were independently associated with delivery within 2 weeks in early-onset FGR. Among cases of early-onset FGR, concentrations of almost all maternal serum cytokines were similar. Maternal serum sVEGFR-1 concentrations were high when delivery occurred within 2 weeks. Maternal serum sCD40L concentrations were elicited only in cases in which delivery within 2 weeks occurred due to fetal deterioration., CONCLUSION: We identified two biomarkers, one specific for FGR and the other dependent on severity, that were significant components of angiogenic activities and inflammation factors. Imbalances in serum protein expression may have a substantial effect on the pathogenesis of FGR. Copyright © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - We aimed to investigate the effects of maternal tadalafil therapy on fetal programming of metabolic function in a mouse model of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Pregnant C57BL6 mice were divided into the control, L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), and tadalafil+L-NAME groups. Six weeks after birth, the male pups in each group were given a high-fat diet. A glucose tolerance test (GTT) was performed at 15 weeks and the pups were euthanized at 20 weeks. We then assessed the histological changes in the liver and adipose tissue, and the adipocytokine production. We found that the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score was higher in the L-NAME group than in the control group (p<0.05). Although the M1 macrophage numbers were significantly higher in the L-NAME/high-fat diet group (p<0.001), maternal tadalafil administration prevented this change. Moreover, the epididymal adipocyte size was significantly larger in the L-NAME group than in the control group. This was also improved by maternal tadalafil administration (p<0.05). Further, we found that resistin levels were significantly lower in the L-NAME group compared to the control group (p<0.05). The combination of exposure to maternal L-NAME and a high-fat diet induced glucose impairment and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. However, maternal tadalafil administration prevented these complications. Thus, deleterious fetal programming caused by FGR might be modified by in utero intervention with tadalafil.

AB  - AIM: To investigate changes of gut hormones in term and preterm infants in the first 2 months after birth, as the role and relationships of gut hormones in premature infants has not been well elucidated., METHODS: In 29 preterm and five term infants, fasting serum concentrations of leptin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), peptide YY (PYY), pancreatic polypeptide, insulin, amylin, and ghrelin were measured using a bead array system., RESULTS: Serum leptin concentration soon after birth showed a positive correlation with gestational week in all infants (r=0.623, p<0.01). Serum leptin level rapidly decreased in all infants. In preterm infants, serum GLP-1 levels at birth showed negative correlations with gestational week (r=-0.447, p=0.02). Serum GIP, GLP-1, and PYY levels increased after birth and were persistently high until 10 weeks of life., CONCLUSION: Serum concentrations of different gut hormones changed postnatally in their specific ways in preterm infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Chemerin, a novel adipocytokine, has been implicated in major metabolic and inflammatory processes. Study aims were to determine whether circulating maternal chemerin concentration (1) differs between pregnant and non-pregnant women, (2) changes as a function of gestational age, and (3) correlates with maternal insulin resistance. In addition, we investigated which compartment, maternal, fetal or placental, is the source of chemerin in maternal circulation., METHODS: The study included three groups: Non-pregnant (n=18), pregnant women in the first trimester (n=19) and pregnant women in the third trimester (n=33). Chemerin was measured in cord blood and in maternal serum samples taken before and after delivery. Chemerin mRNA expression was evaluated in fetal and human adult tissues., RESULTS: Chemerin serum concentration was significantly higher in pregnant women in the third trimester than in non-pregnant and pregnant women in the first trimester. Chemerin concentration positively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and insulin resistance. Antenatal chemerin concentration was significantly lower than that during the postpartum period. Neonatal chemerin did not correlate with maternal one. Chemerin mRNA expression was abundant in fetal and adult liver and omental fat, but relatively low in placenta., CONCLUSIONS: Chemerin is increased during normal gestation and is associated with maternal BMI and insulin resistance. Maternal tissues, possibly liver and adipose tissue, contribute to the increased maternal chemerin concentration.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adult body fat is associated with birth anthropometry, suggesting a role for metabolic regulators including vitamin D and the adipokines-adiponectin and irisin-which have been reported to interact but, as yet, data remain controversial., OBJECTIVE: To study (i) the relationship between vitamin D, its binding protein (VDBP) and the adipokines, adiponectin, and irisin in mothers and neonates at birth and (ii) their effects on neonate anthropometric outcomes., DESIGN: Cross-sectional study for healthy mothers with full-term and uncomplicated births., SETTING: Primary care., SUBJECTS: Seventy pairs of newly delivered neonates and their mothers., MAIN OUTCOMES FEATURES: Biochemical markers from maternal and cord: VDBP, adiponectin, irisin, calcium, albumin, parathyroid hormone, 25OHD, 1,25(OH)2D. Maternal demographic and social characteristics and neonate anthropometric parameters were recorded., RESULTS: Maternal VDBP levels (364.1 +/- 11.9 mug/ml) demonstrated a strong positive correlation with maternal adiponectin (4.4 +/- 0.4 mug/ml) and irisin (308.8 +/- 50.8 ng/ml) concentrations, which remained significant (p < 0.001 and p < 0.041, respectively) after adjustment with multiple parameters, including weeks of gestation, maternal age, and BMI. The finding of a strong association of VDBP (355.3 +/- 29.2 mug/ml) and adiponectin (11.9 +/- 2.0 mug/ml) but not irisin (174.4 +/- 26.0 ng/ml) was also evident in neonates (p = 0.03 and p = 0.94, respectively). No association was observed in both maternal and neonatal vitamin D, adiponectin, and irisin., CONCLUSIONS: The main findings of this study are (i) the perspective of a potential independent interaction of VDBP and adiponectin in both mothers and neonates and (ii) the lack of a causative model effect of both maternal/neonatal vitamin D status and adipokine profile on neonatal anthropometry at birth, as a surrogate marker of future metabolic health of the offspring.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Leptin takes part in fat regulation and can also take part in regulation of prenatal fetal weight., DESIGN: The aim of the study was to find correlation between leptin concentration in healthy women and intrauterine growth restriction., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was done in Medical University in Lodz in 2000-2002. The study group consisted of 50 women with IUGR, the control group of 50 healthy pregnant women. Elisa immunoenzymatic IBL test was used. The results were expressed in microgram/l., RESULTS: In group of normal pregnancy leptin concentration was 5.347 +/- 1.098 micrograms/l. In group of intrauterine growth restriction leptin concentration was 4.617 +/- 0.949 micrograms/l. The difference between groups was statistically significant but the mean values in both groups were normal for nonpregnant women., CONCLUSIONS: Low concentration of leptin can play role in intrauterine growth restriction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Adiponectin, resistin and visfatin are thought to play role in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes (GDM). In this study, we aimed to investigate the association of maternal second trimester serum resistin and visfatin levels with GDM., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Screening and diagnosis for GDM was performed between the 24-28th gestational weeks. About 40 women diagnosed with GDM and 40 non-diabetic women constituted the study and control groups, respectively. Groups were compared for second trimester maternal serum resistin, visfatin and HbA1c levels, HOMA-IR and postpartum 75 g OGTT results., RESULTS: Mean serum resistin (p = 0.071) and visfatin (p = 0.194) levels were similar between the groups. However, mean BMI (p = 0.013), HOMA-IR (p = 0.019), HbA1c (p < 0.0001) and birth weight (p = 0.037) were significantly higher in GDM group compared to controls. Type 2 diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance were detected in 2 (5%) and 7 (20%) women in the GDM group, respectively, with 75 g OGTT performed at the postpartum 6th week. Resistin levels of patients with GDM and postpartum glucose intolerance were higher than those with GDM but no postpartum glucose intolerance (p = 0.012). Visfatin levels in the GDM group showed a positive correlation with biparietal diameter, head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Maternal serum resistin and visfatin levels are unchanged in GDM. In patients with GDM, second trimester resistin levels may be predictive for postpartum glucose intolerance and second trimester visfatin levels may be related with fetal biometric measurements. Further larger studies are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin is critical for central nervous system development and maturation. This study aimed to evaluate the potential regulatory role of cord leptin in the neuropsychomotor development of children ages 18 months to 6 years., METHODS: This study included 424 children from a prospective mother-child cohort (Rhea Study; Crete, Greece) with available cord leptin levels and data on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition), 4 years (McCarthy Scales of Children's Abilities), and 6 years (Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices and Trail Making Test). Multivariable linear regression models were used to explore the associations., RESULTS: Each 10-ng/mL increase in the cord leptin level was associated with increased scores on the gross motor scale at 18 months (beta coefficient: 3.8; 95% CI: 0.0-7.5), with decreased scores in the general cognitive performance (beta coefficient: -3.0; 95% CI: -5.5 to -0.4), perceptual performance (beta coefficient: -3.4; 95% CI: -6.0 to -9.9), working memory (beta coefficient: -3.1; 95% CI: -5.7 to -0.4), executive function (beta coefficient -3.1; 95% CI: -5.7 to -0.5), and functions of the posterior cortex (beta coefficient: -2.7; 95% CI: -5.2 to -0.1) scales at 4 years, and with a 3.7-unit decrease in the Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices score at 6 years (beta coefficient: -3.7; 95% CI: -6.9 to -0.5)., CONCLUSIONS: Increased cord leptin levels are associated with enhanced gross motor development at 18 months but decreased cognitive performance in early and middle childhood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin represents a potential modulator of developmental programming of childhood obesity. We investigated the association of cord blood leptin with growth trajectories from birth to early childhood., MATERIALS/METHODS: We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort "Rhea", Crete, Greece. Cord blood samples from 642 neonates were collected. 578 (90%) children had complete follow up data from birth to 4years. We measured child weight, height, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, blood pressure, and serum lipids, leptin, adiponectin and C-reactive protein in early childhood (median 4.2years). We estimated growth trajectories from 3months up to 4years using random-effects linear-spline models. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used adjusting for confounders., RESULTS: Mean cord blood leptin levels were 7.3ng/mL (standard deviation: 6.3). Children with high cord blood leptin (>90th percentile) exhibited lower weight, height and body mass index from 6months to early childhood. Each SD increase in cord blood leptin was associated with lower weight at the age of 4 by 242g (95% CI: -416, -69). In a stratified analysis, the reverse association was observed in children born small for gestational age (p for interaction=0.001), and in those exhibiting rapid infant growth during the first 3months of life (p for interaction=0.002). Cord blood leptin levels were not associated with cardiometabolic risk factors at 4years., CONCLUSIONS: Long term programming effects of in utero exposure to leptin extends beyond infancy into early childhood. Further studies are needed to explore potential effect modification by intrauterine and early infancy growth patterns. Copyright © 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin is an adipocyte-secreted hormone that regulates energy homeostasis, while its role in fetal programming remains poorly understood. We aimed to evaluate the effect of maternal weight status on cord blood leptin levels and their combined effect on fetal growth., METHODS: We included 638 mother-child pairs from the prospective mother-child cohort 'Rhea' study in Crete, Greece with singleton pregnancies, providing cord blood serum samples for leptin analysis and complete data on birth outcomes. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were used adjusting for confounders. Generalised additive models were used to explore the form of the relationship between cord leptin and continuous birth outcomes., RESULTS: Log cord leptin was positively associated with birthweight {beta-coef: 176.5 [95% confidence interval (CI): 133.0, 220.0] }, ponderal index (beta-coef: 1.0 [95% CI: 0.6, 1.4] ) and gestational age (beta-coef: 0.7 [95% CI: 0.5, 0.8] ). Excessive weight gain during pregnancy was associated with a threefold increased risk for cord hyperleptinaemia {relative risk (RR): 3.0, [95% CI: 1.5, 6.3] }. Maternal pre-pregnancy overweight/obesity [body mass index (BMI) >=25 kg/m(2) ] increased the risk of giving birth to a hyperleptinaemic neonate (RR: 2.1 [95% CI: 1.4, 3.2] and the effect of log leptin on birthweight (beta-coef: 219.1 [95% CI: 152.3, 285.9] compared with women with a BMI <25 kg/m(2) (beta-coef: 150.5 [95% CI: 93.1, 207.9]., CONCLUSIONS: Higher cord blood leptin levels are associated with increased size at birth and gestational age, while maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and weight gain during pregnancy represent significant indicators of cord blood leptin.

AB  - Cord leptin is a biomarker of fetal growth and adiposity with a role in predicting weight gain during the first months of life and childhood obesity. Our objective was to calculate gender-specific reference intervals for cord blood leptin in healthy neonates in Crete, Greece. We used data from the prospective mother-child cohort ("Rhea" study) in Crete, Greece. The analysis included 398 neonates chosen with strict inclusion criteria based on maternal and fetal characteristics. Cord leptin reference intervals for male neonates were 1.4-18.2 ng/mL and for females 2.0-25.8 ng/mL. Females had higher leptin levels (median 7.4; IQR 4.7-10.9) compared to males (median 4.9; IQR 3.2-7.6) (p < 0.001). Conclusion Gender-specific reference ranges are essential in clinical practice for correct interpretation of leptin values in cord blood and early detection of childhood obesity.

AB  - The role of intrauterine environment in the development of obesity is increasingly recognised. Adipokines and specifically leptin have been examined as potential biomarkers predicting early development of obesity. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological evidence for the association between leptin levels in cord blood and anthropometric measurements at birth in healthy mother-newborn pairs. A PubMed search was performed between 1994 and 2009 and manual search of reference lists of retrieved articles. Forty-four studies met the inclusion criteria set. All studies reported a positive correlation between leptin levels and birthweight. The combined correlation coefficient (r) was 0.46 [95%CI 0.43, 0.50]. Leptin levels explained 21% of variation in birthweight. Results were similar in males (r=0.55; 0.40, 0.68) and females (r=0.60; 0.50, 0.69), and between Caucasians (r=0.45; 0.39, 0.51) and eastern Asian populations (r=0.47; 0.37, 0.55). Statistically significant positive correlations were also found for birth length (r=0.29; 0.23, 0.34) and ponderal index (r=0.36; 0.31, 0.41). There was no indication of publication bias (Egger's test P-value=0.23). This meta-analysis shows a clear but moderate correlation between leptin levels in cord blood and birthweight that is observed in different population groups.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the association of trimester-specific gestational weight gain with offspring fetal growth, obesity risk, and cardiometabolic health outcomes from birth to 4 years of age., STUDY DESIGN: We conducted the present study with 977 mother-child pairs of the pregnancy cohort "Rhea" study in Crete, Greece. We measured birthweight, body mass index from 6 months to 4 years of age, waist circumference, skinfold thickness, blood pressure, and blood levels of lipids, C-reactive protein, and adipose tissue hormones at 4 years of age. We used multiple linear and log Poisson regression models to examine the association of exposure with continuous or binary outcomes, respectively., RESULTS: Greater rate of gestational weight gain in the first trimester of pregnancy (per 200 g/wk) was associated with increased risk of overweight/obesity from 2 years (relative risk [RR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.09-1.42) to 4 years of age (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05-1.25), but not with birth size. Each 200 g/wk of weight gain in the first trimester of pregnancy was also associated with greater risk of high waist circumference (RR, 1.13; 95% CI, 1.04-1.23), high sum of skinfold thickness (RR, 1.15; 95% CI, 1.02-1.29), and higher diastolic blood pressure at 4 years of age (beta, 0.43 mm Hg; 95% CI, 0.00-0.86). Greater rate of gestational weight gain during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (per 200 g/wk) was associated with greater risk of large-for-gestational-age neonates (RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.02, 1.45) and higher levels of cord blood leptin (ratio of geometric means, 1.08; 95% CI, 1.00-1.17), but not with child anthropometry at later ages., CONCLUSION: Timing of gestational weight gain may influence childhood cardiometabolic outcomes differentially.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the relationship between skinfold thickness and serum leptin, ghrelin, adiponectin, and resistin levels in infants of diabetic mothers. Biochemical parameters were also similar for the two groups (infants of diabetic mothers and controls) (p > 0.05). We confirmed that there was a negative correlation between birth weight and serum ghrelin level (p < 0.05) in the two groups. When it was evaluated for control newborns, a positive correlation between abdominal circumference and serum resistin level was found in the controls (p < 0.05). Our results indicate that gestational diabetes by appropriate diet or insulin treatment may be effective in the protection of fetuses of diabetic mothers from the negative effects of gestational diabetes. Ghrelin alone was negatively correlated with birth weight. This negative correlation could be potentially advantageous to infants, because a reduction in appetite might prevent excessive food intake and postnatal weight gain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluation of serum concentration of leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and MCP-1 in pregnant patients with different types of diabetes mellitus (DM) considering preconception planning and method of DM correction in 11-14th and 30-34th weeks of pregnancy., STUDY DESIGN: Longitudinal, prospective study included 130 pregnant women divided into the following comparison groups: type 1 DM (T1DM, n = 40), type 2 DM (T2DM, n = 35), GDM (n = 40), and the control group (n = 15). The ELISA method defined the levels of leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and MCP-1 concentration in serum, which was assessed in 11-14th and 30-34th weeks of pregnancy. Statistical analysis was accomplished using SPSS 23.0 and "Prism 8-GraphPad" software., RESULTS: The leptin level in the 1st trimester was the highest in T2DM insulin group compared to the control due to gestational age, hence in the 3rd trimester in all groups its serum concentrations appeared higher than in healthy patients (p = 0.0001). In the 1st trimester leptin levels directly correlated with women's BMI, newborns' weight and macrosomia rate, in the 3rd trimester - with OGTT levels, HbA1c, gestational hypertension, and preeclampsia rates. Resistin levels in the 1st and 3rd trimesters were increased in almost all DM groups compared to the control group (p = 0.0001). The study established direct positive correlation between resistin and HbA1c, birth weight, and preeclampsia. In the 1st trimester, adiponectin demonstrated the lowest levels in T2DM insulin compared to T1DM and the control group (p = 0.0001) while in the 3rd trimester, adiponectin levels declined alongside gestational age in DM patients and all the groups compared to the control group (p < 0.05). Adiponectin negatively correlated with BMI, OGTT levels, and preeclampsia rate. MCP-1 levels in T2DM appeared higher than in T1DM patients and the control group in the 1st trimester, whereas in the 3rd trimester MCP-1 declined, correlating with BMI, preeclampsia and OGTT levels., CONCLUSION: High rate of adverse perinatal outcomes in diabetic pregnancy might be developed due to more severe metabolic failures and further disturbances of adipokines expression.

AB  - ABS T R A C T BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to analyze the differences between myokine and adipokine factors under stable conditions ac-cording to the menstrual cycle (luteal and follicular phases) and to investigate the effect of regular resistance exercise on the changes in myokine and adipokine factors according to menstrual cycle in obese female college students. METHODS: The study participants were female college students with a body fat percentage of 30% or more (N.-20), divided into two groups: luteal phase (N.-12) and follicular phase (N.-8). They performed regular resistance exercise three times a week, 60 minutes daily, for 16 weeks. Parameters measured include body composition via impedance, visceral fat area using computed tomography and myokine and adipokine fac-tors in blood. RESULTS: Levels of BDNF (P < 0.05), NGF (P < 0.01), and adiponectin (P < 0.01) were significantly increased in the luteal phase group after 16 weeks relative to the baseline values. Leptin (P < 0.01) was significantly decreased in the luteal phase group after 16 weeks. Weight, Body Mass Index, %fat, and visceral fat area were significantly decreased in both groups after 16 weeks. Muscle mass was significantly increased in both groups after 16 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Regular resistance exercise affected the reduction in visceral fat area and had a positive effect on body composition which might be altered favorably by myokines and adipokines. Thus, the timing of blood collection is very important in obese female college students.

AB  - Premature infants have chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) that increases morbidity, and the youngest and the smallest premature infants are at the greatest risk. The combination of lung injury from inflammation/oxidative stress causing low functional residual capacity combined with frequent short apneas leads to CIH. Adiponectin (APN) is an adipose-derived adipokine that protects the lung from inflammation and oxidative stress. Premature and small for gestational age (SGA) infants have minimal body fat and low levels of circulating APN. To begin to understand the potential role of APN in lung protection during lung development, we characterized the developmental profile of APN and APN receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) protein and mRNA expression in the newborn rat lung at fetal day (FD) 19, and postnatal days (PD) 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, and 28. Protein levels in lung homogenates were measured by western blot analyses; relative mRNA expression was detected by quantitative PCR (qPCR); and serum high molecular weight (HMW) APN was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: APN protein and mRNA levels were lowest at FD19 and PD1, increased 2.2-fold at PD4, decreased at PD10, and then increased again at PD21. AdipoR1 protein and mRNA levels peaked at PD1, followed by a threefold drop by PD4, and remained low until PD21. AdipoR2 protein and mRNA levels also peaked at PD1, but remained high at PD4, followed by a 1.7-fold drop by PD10 that remained low by PD21. Serum APN levels detected by ELISA did not differ from PD4 to PD28. To date, this is the first report characterizing APN and APN receptor protein and mRNA expression in the rat lung during development. The developmental stage of the newborn rat lung models that of the premature human infant; both are in the saccular stage of lung development. In the newborn rat lung, alveolarization begins at PD4, peaks at PD10, and ends at PD21. Importantly, we found that AdipoR1 receptor protein and mRNA expression is lowest during lung alveolarization (PD4 to PD21). Thus, we speculate that low levels of AdipoR1 during lung alveolarization contributes to the increased susceptibility to developing acute lung edema and chronic lung injury such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in premature human infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birthweight (LBW) is associated with an increased risk for atherosclerotic coronary heart disease (ACHD) later in life. However, little information is currently available on the relationship between birthweight (BW) and risk factors for ACHD in children., METHODS: The relationship between BW and risk factors for ACHD was evaluated in 330 Japanese children (187 boys and 143 girls) aged between 7 and 12 years, who underwent screening for lifestyle-related diseases in Okinawa, Japan. Routine chemical methods were used to determine the serum concentrations of lipids, apolipoproteins, uric acid and glucose. Serum insulin and adiponectin were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay., RESULTS: BW was significantly correlated with serum concentrations of adiponectin (r= 0.163, P= 0.003) and uric acid (r=-0.166. P= 0.003), but not with insulin, lipids or apolipoproteins. These correlations were still significant even after adjusting for age, gender and body mass index (BMI) percentile (BW and adiponectin, r= 0.239, P= 0.000; BW and uric acid, r=-0.247, P= 0.000). In addition, BW was correlated with high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) only after adjusting for age, gender and BMI percentile (r= 0.117, P= 0.034). In a stepwise multiple regression analysis, BW was a significant predictive variable for adiponectin and uric acid. However, weight velocity (weight gain/year) was a stronger predictive variable than BW for both adiponectin and uric acid. BW was not a significant predictive variable for HDL-C. Adiponectin was the strongest predictive variable for HDL-C., CONCLUSION: BW is related to serum concentrations of adiponectin and uric acid. However, weight velocity was a stronger determinant of serum adiponectin and uric acid levels than BW in Japanese schoolchildren. Thus, it may be important to control weight gain to prevent the development of ACHD in children, especially in children with LBW.

AB  - Introduction. Inflammation is an important contributor to the development of chronic diseases. We examined whether a healthy Nordic diet, also called the Baltic Sea diet, associates with lower concentrations of inflammatory markers. Methods. We used two independent cross-sectional studies: the DILGOM study including Finnish participants aged 25 - 74 years (n = 4 579), and the Helsinki Birth Cohort Study including individuals born at Helsinki University Central Hospital between 1934 and 1944 and who participated in a clinical examination in 2001 - 2004 (n = 1911). Both studies measured anthropometrics, drew blood, and assessed concentrations of leptin, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor a, interleukin 6, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). A food frequency questionnaire was used to measure dietary intake over the past year and calculate the Baltic Sea Diet Score (BSDS). Results. In both studies, linear regression adjusting for age, sex, energy intake, lifestyle factors, obesity, statin medication, and upstream inflammatory markers revealed an inverse association between the BSDS and hs-CRP concentrations (P < 0.01). Especially, high intake of Nordic fruits and cereals, low intake of red and processed meat, and moderate intake of alcohol contributed to the emerged association (P < 0.05). The BSDS did not associate with other inflammatory markers. Conclusion. The Baltic Sea diet is associated with lower hs-CRP concentrations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the impact of a mild form of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) on neonatal birth size, and on insulin-related hormones and adiponectin (AdipoQ) in cord blood., METHODS: Two hundred and sixteen Japanese pregnant women diagnosed as having normal glucose tolerance according to the JSOG criteria were enrolled. Of the 216 women, 38 women were reclassified into a mild GDM (mGDM) group according to the IADPSG criteria. Of the remaining 178 women, 135 women with normal 50-g glucose challenge test were reclassified into a normal glucose tolerance (NGT) group. Cord blood insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, IGF-binding proteins (IGFBPs) and AdipoQ were measured in the offspring of the two groups., RESULTS: Birth weight and its SD scores were larger in the mGDM group than in the NGT group. The incidence of large-for-gestational age (LGA) newborns was higher in the mGDM than in the NGT group. No differences in cord blood free IGF-1, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2 or AdipoQ levels were observed between the mGDM and NGT groups., CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that mild GDM reclassified according to the IADPSG criteria influences neonatal birth size, but neither the IGF-IGFBP axis nor AdipoQ can account for the changes of birth size in offspring of women with mild GDM.

AB  - Objective: Fetal exposure to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) increases the risk of metabolic diseases in the offspring. Leptin, adiponectin, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) may play potential roles in the underlying disease mechanisms. We investigated the impact of fetal exposure to GDM on leptin, adiponectin, and FGF21 concentrations and their associations with measures of adiposity and metabolic traits during childhood/adolescence. Design and methods: The follow-up study included 504 GDM and 540 control offspring aged 9-16 from the Danish National Birth Cohort. Anthropometric measurements, fasting blood samples, puberty status and fat percentages by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry were examined. Serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, and FGF21 were measured by validated immune assays. Results: GDM offspring had 38% (95% CI: 22-55%) higher leptin, 0.6 mg/L (95% CI: -1.2, -0.04 mg/L) lower adiponectin, and 32% (95% CI: -47%, -12%) lower FGF21 concentrations than control offspring (P < 0.05). After adjustment for confounders including maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GDM offspring had borderline higher leptin (P = 0.06) and significantly lower FGF21 concentrations (P = 0.006). When accounting for offspring BMI z-score, GDM exposure had no significant independent effect on leptin or adiponectin concentrations, whereas FGF21 was still significant. In univariate analyses, leptin and adiponectin were associated with fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and adiposity, and FGF21 with total fat percentage. Conclusions: GDM offspring had higher leptin, lower adiponectin and FGF21 concentrations than control offspring. Elevated leptin and decreased adiponectin concentrations associated with adverse metabolic traits and were most likely driven by higher obesity prevalence among GDM offspring. The functional implications of decreased FGF21 concentrations among GDM offspring need to be further explored.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to quantify serum adiponectin concentrations in short children born small for gestational age (SGA) compared with those in children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and to assess the relationship between the serum levels of adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) known as a predictor of the development of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixteen prepubertal short children born SGA and 20 short children born AGA, matched for age, body mass index, height, pubertal status, gestational age, bone age and midparental height, were included in the study. The serum levels of adiponectin, IGFBP-1, insulin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) were measured in the fasting state., RESULTS: The levels of serum adiponectin were significantly lower in the SGA than in AGA children (10.5 +/- 4.2 vs. 13.9 +/- 5.1 micro g/ml, P < 0.05). The levels of serum IGFBP-1, insulin and IGF-I were all similar in both groups. Overall, there was a significant positive correlation between adiponectin and IGFBP-1 (r = 0.40, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that hypoadiponectinaemia in short SGA children without catch-up growth may reflect insulin resistance and imply a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus. Additionally, adiponectin may be a more sensitive indicator for latent insulin resistance than IGFBP-1 in short SGA children.

AB  - Serum adiponectin levels were investigated in 28 small-for-gestational-age (SGA) and 34 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) term neonates to examine how fetal growth correlates with adiponectin levels. A blood sample for determination of adiponectin was obtained during the first 24 h of life. The levels of serum adiponectin were significantly higher in all newborn infants than in healthy children (28.7 +/- 17.0 versus 9.3 +/- 6.1 microg/mL; p < 0.01). There was a significant difference in adiponectin levels between SGA and AGA infants (23.2 +/- 14.8 versus 33.2 +/- 17.5 microg/mL; p=0.02). For all of the newborn groups, serum adiponectin levels correlated positively with birth weight (r=0.27, p <0.05) and head circumference (r=0.30, p <0.05). There was no relationship between serum adiponectin levels and gestational age, birth length, blood glucose levels, or blood sampling time after birth. There was no gender difference in adiponectin levels in the entire newborn group (30.0 +/- 19.7 versus 28.0 +/- 15.5 microg/mL, in male and female infants). Our results suggest that hyperadiponectinemia and a positive relationship between the serum levels of adiponectin and birth weight in newborns cannot be explained by the low percentage of body fat alone. Lower adiponectin levels in SGA infants than in AGA infants are unlikely to suggest insulin resistance in intrauterine growth-retarded infants in early postnatal life but may be a predisposing factor in the future development of insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We investigated the associations between second trimester amniotic fluid (AF) levels of human adiponectin and placental growth factor (PLGF) in small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adiponectin and PLGF levels were determined by enzyme immunoassay in AF of 21 SGA, 13 LGA and 44 AGA fetuses between 15-22 weeks of gestation, derived from pregnant women who underwent amniocentesis., RESULTS: Adiponectin and PLGF levels were detectable in AF. Median (25th-75th percentile) adiponectin levels were 16.1 (10.9-32.3) ng/ml in SGA, 19.5 (15.1-30.9) ng/ml in AGA, and 18.2 (14.7-30.8) ng/ml in LGA fetuses. Median (25th-75th percentile) PLGF levels were 24.2 (19.9-34.9) pg/nl in SGA, 26.4 (20.9-33.8) pg/ml in AGA and 33.5 (21.8-40.4) pg/ml in LGA fetuses. The differences were not statistically significant. Nevertheless, indication of differentiation of levels existed when SGA and LGA fetuses in the extremes of distribution were considered. Specifically, very severely SGA fetuses (<=2.5th percentile) tended to have high levels of adiponectin and reduced levels of PLGF in AF., CONCLUSION: This is the first study presenting adiponectin and PLGF concentrations in early second trimester amniotic fluid in AGA, SGA and LGA fetuses. The altered concentrations of adiponectin and PLGF in very severely SGA fetuses possibly result from the growth-promoting effect of these factors through the metabolic route and the vascular integrity of the placenta, respectively.

AB  - Adiponectin is an adipocyte-derived hormone with profound insulin-sensitizing, antiinflammatory, and antiatherogenic effects. Apart from its obvious potential as a mediator of adult metabolic syndrome, adiponectin could have a significant role in regulating fetal growth. We measured plasma adiponectin concentrations by ELISA in cord vein of 197 infants. Of them, 122 were born preterm (gestational age, 22-32 wk), and 75 at term (49 from a healthy and 26 from a diabetic pregnancy, with similar findings, and thus all data from term infants pooled). Mean adiponectin concentrations increased from less than 1 microg/ml at 24 wk gestation to approximately 20 microg/ml at term. One week increase in gestational age corresponded in preterm infants to 43% increase (95% confidence interval 34-53%; P < 0.0001) in adiponectin and term infants to 21% increase (12-31%; P < 0.0001). In preterm infants, one unit increase in birth weight sd score corresponded to 42% increase (22-66%; P = 0.0001) in adiponectin, and females had 57% higher adiponectin concentrations (0-146%; P = 0.05) than males. These differences were not seen in term infants. Adiponectin levels were lower in preterm infants with recent (<12 h) exposure to maternal betamethasone but were unrelated to mode of delivery, preeclampsia, or impaired umbilical artery flow. In conclusion, adiponectin concentrations in fetal circulation show a 20-fold rise between 24 wk gestation and term and, in preterm infants are associated with birth weight sd score, sex, and glucocorticoid exposure. Adiponectin may play an important role in regulating fetal growth and explaining its links to the metabolic syndrome and its consequences during adult life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate relationship between anthropometric values of premature babies with their's glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin at birth and on day 15., METHODS: We analyzed fasting and postprandial glucose, insulin, leptin, and ghrelin levels at birth and on day 15 in babies born prematurely between 24 and 37 weeks, and who did not have serious problems aside from prematurity at birth., RESULTS: Fasting glucose, insulin, leptin and ghrelin values of babies at birth and on day 15 were significantly lower than postprandial values (all p values p < 0.001). There were positive correlations between the mean insulin, leptin, and ghrelin levels with the gestational age, birth weight, body mass index, head circumference of babies at birth, and anthropometric values on day 15 (all r values > 0.400, all p values < 0.05). Fasting glucose, leptin, and ghrelin values of mothers birth were significantly lower than post-prandial values (all p values p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The positive correlations between the insulin, leptin, and ghrelin values of babies at birth with gestational age and anthropometric values suggest that both hormones play important roles in fetal and neonatal growth and development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Large- (LGA) and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA) infants differ in body fat mass and metabolic/endocrine mechanisms. We aimed to investigate in LGA and AGA infants possible alterations in cord blood levels of insulin and the adipokines vaspin and omentin-1 which are secreted by the adipose tissue and are implicated in insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome., METHODS: Cord blood vaspin, omentin-1 and insulin levels were prospectively measured in 61 LGA and 36 AGA singleton full-term infants. Of the LGA group 13 infants were born from diabetic and 48 from non-diabetic mothers., RESULTS: Cord blood vaspin and omentin-1 levels were significantly higher in LGA compared with AGA neonates (p = 0.021 and b = 0.115, SE 0.037, p = 0.002, respectively). Umbilical cord omentin-1 levels were significantly decreased in neonates delivered vaginally (b = -0.075, SE 0.031, p = 0.016), after controlling for group. Insulin levels increased in proportion to the customized centiles of the infants (b = 0.004, SE = 0.001, p = 0.009). Finally, in the LGA group vaspin levels correlated with omentin-1 serum levels (r = 0.318, p = 0.013)., CONCLUSIONS: The increased levels of vaspin observed in LGA infants compared with AGA ones, possibly represent a defensive mechanism against insulin/glucose dysregulation, commonly seen in the former. In addition, the increased omentin-1 levels in the LGA group could possibly reflect the amount of developing adipose tissue in the early stages of life in this group. Alternatively, these levels could reflect the growth-promoting effect of omentin-1 in the fetus. The inflammation associated with vaginal deliveries may account for the lower cord blood omentin-1 levels in neonates delivered by this mode. Copyright © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adiponectin (APN) concentration in umbilical cord serum is higher than that in adult serum. Except for the positive association between birth weight and cord APN concentration, little is known about the pathophysiological function of APN in fetal development., OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship of cord serum APN and IGF-I concentrations with the development of the fetoplacental unit., DESIGN AND METHODS: Umbilical cord serum APN and IGF-I concentrations were measured in term singleton deliveries (n = 94). The association of cord APN and IGF-I concentrations was evaluated in relation to fetal weight, placental weight, and fetoplacental (F/P) weight ratio., RESULTS: Mean concentrations and sd of APN and IGF-I were 36.1 +/- 14.0 microg/ml and 58.6 +/- 27.0 ng/ml, respectively. Cord APN concentration was positively associated with F/P weight ratio (r = 0.375, P < 0.001) as well as fetal weight (r = 0.389, P < 0.001) but not placental weight. Cord IGF-I concentration was positively associated with fetal weight (r = 0.405, P < 0.001) and placental weight (r = 0.400, P < 0.001) but not F/P weight ratio. In multiregression analysis, only APN concentration resulted in a significant determinant of F/P weight ratio among variables (beta = 0.376, P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: In cord hyperadiponectinemia, fetuses tend to be disproportionately larger for their placental weight and vice versa in cord hypoadiponectinemia. APN is shown to be the first biomarker positively associated with F/P weight ratio.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal adiposity is a risk factor for childhood obesity. Investigating contributors to neonatal adiposity is important for understanding early life obesity risk. Epigenetic changes of metabolic genes in cord blood may contribute to excessive neonatal adiposity and subsequent childhood obesity. This study aims to evaluate the association of cord blood DNA methylation patterns with anthropometric measures and cord blood leptin, a biomarker of neonatal adiposity., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed on a multiethnic cohort of 114 full term neonates born to mothers without gestational diabetes at a university hospital. Cord blood was assayed for leptin and for epigenome-wide DNA methylation profiles via the Illumina 450K platform. Neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Multivariable linear regression was used to analyze associations between individual CpG sites as well as differentially methylated regions in cord blood DNA with measures of newborn adiposity including anthropometrics (birth weight, fat mass and percent body fat) and cord blood leptin. False discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: 247 CpG sites as well as 18 differentially methylated gene regions were associated with cord blood leptin but no epigenetic changes were associated with birth weight, fat mass or percent body fat. Genes of interest identified in this study are DNAJA4, TFR2, SMAD3, PLAG1, FGF1, and HNF4A., CONCLUSION: Epigenetic changes in cord blood DNA are associated with cord blood leptin levels, a measure of neonatal adiposity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between cord blood amino acid and acylcarnitine profiles and measures of adiposity and hyperinsulinemia in healthy newborns., STUDY DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 118 full-term infants born to mothers without gestational diabetes was performed. Cord blood leptin, C-peptide, acylcarnitine, and amino acid levels were measured. Body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Multivariate linear regression and principal component analysis were used to analyze associations of cord blood metabolites with newborn anthropometrics, leptin, and C-peptide., RESULTS: Acylcarnitines AC C2, AC C4-DC/Ci4-DC, and AC C8:1-OH/C6:1-DC were positively associated with leptin, and AC C14, AC C14:2, AC C16, AC C18, and AC C18:2 were negatively associated with C-peptide (P <= .0016). Principal component analysis revealed a positive association between factor 1(AC C2, AC C3, AC C5, AC C4/Ci4, AC C4-OH, AC C4-DC/Ci4-DC, glutamate/glutamine, and glycine) and adiposity measures., CONCLUSIONS: The positive association of AC C2 and AC C4-DC/Ci4-DC levels with leptin may reflect excess fat stores, higher fatty acid oxidation rate, and mitochondrial dysfunction leading to accumulation of acylcarnitine intermediates. Principal component analysis revealed a positive association between branched chain amino acid and ketone body metabolites and adiposity, confirming prior findings in adults. Cord blood acylcarnitine profiles may identify at-risk children before obesity or insulin resistance develops. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal adiposity has many determinants and may be a risk factor for future obesity. Epigenetic regulation of metabolically important genes is a potential contributor., OBJECTIVES: The objective of the study is to determine whether methylation changes in the LEP gene in cord blood DNA are impacted by the maternal environment or affect neonatal adiposity measures., METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 114 full-term neonates born to healthy mothers with normal glucose tolerance was performed. Cord blood was assayed for leptin and genome-wide DNA methylation profiles via the Illumina 450K platform. Neonatal body composition was measured by air displacement plethysmography. Multivariate linear regression models and semi-partial correlation coefficients were used to analyze associations. False discovery rate was estimated to account for multiple comparisons., RESULTS: Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI was associated with decreased methylation at five CpG sites near the LEP transcription start site in an adjusted model (false discovery rate <0.022 for each site). The association between maternal BMI and cord blood leptin approached significance (r = 0.18, p = 0.054). Cord blood leptin was positively correlated with neonatal adiposity measures including birth weight (r = 0.45, p < 0.001), fat mass (r = 0.47, p < 0.001) and percent body fat (r = 0.44, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI is strongly associated with decreased cord blood LEP gene methylation and may mediate the well-known association between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and neonatal adiposity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Infants with higher adiposity at birth may be at greater risk of developing obesity later in life. IGF-1 is important for intrauterine growth and may be a useful early life marker of adiposity, and thus later obesity risk. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between cord blood IGF-1, neonatal anthropometrics and markers of neonatal adiposity., DESIGN, PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: A cross-sectional study design was utilized to study a multiethnic cohort of full-term neonates born to healthy mothers with normal glucose tolerance at a large university hospital. Neonatal cord blood was collected after birth and assayed for IGF-1, leptin and C-peptide. Neonatal body composition was measured between 24 and 72 h of life using the method of air displacement plethysmography., RESULTS: Cord blood IGF-1 was positively and significantly associated with markers of neonatal adiposity in models adjusted for maternal age at delivery, race, maternal prepregnancy BMI, gestational age at delivery and neonatal sex: birthweight (r = 0.62, P < 0.001), leptin (r = 0.33, P = 0.018), fat mass (r = 0.52, P < 0.001) and percent body fat (r = 0.51, P < 0.001). Cord blood IGF-1 was not associated with cord blood C-peptide., CONCLUSIONS: Cord blood IGF-1 is strongly associated with all measures of neonatal adiposity suggesting that IGF-1 may be an important contributor to in utero neonatal fat accumulation.

AB  - Inflammation during placental malaria (PM) is associated with low birth weight (LBW), especially during the first pregnancy, but the relative contribution of maternal or fetal factors that mediate this effect remains unclear and the role of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) has been controversial. We examined the relationship of maternal and cord plasma levels of IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin-10, ferritin, and leptin to birth weight for Tanzanian women delivering in an area where there is a high rate of malaria transmission. The placental levels of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-gamma, increased significantly during PM in primigravid and multigravid women but not in secundigravid women. PM also increased maternal peripheral levels of all inflammatory markers except IFN-gamma but had strikingly little effect on cord levels of these proteins. In a multivariate analysis, placental IFN-gamma was negatively associated (P = 0.01) and cord ferritin was positively associated (P < 0.0001) with birth weight in infected (PM-positive [PM+]) first-time mothers. This relationship was not observed in other mothers, consistent with the epidemiology of PM and disease. Cord leptin had a strong positive relationship with birth weight in offspring of PM-negative women (P = 0.02 to P < 0.0001) but not in offspring of PM+ women (all differences were not significant) in the three gravidity groups. The results confirmed that placental IFN-gamma is related to LBW due to PM during first pregnancies and suggest that fetal ferritin plays a protective role. Because fetal cells are a source of placental IFN-gamma and cord ferritin, the fetal response to PM may modify the risk of LBW.

AB  - Transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGF beta 1) is an adipokine secreted from adipose tissue, placental tissue and immune cells with a role in cell proliferation, cell apoptosis and angiogenic proliferation. The role of TGF beta 1 in pregnancy and child growth and the source of cord TGF beta 1 are yet unknown. In this study, we sought to clarify the correlation of TGF beta 1 levels with parameters of intrauterine growth and child growth during the first year of life, and to determine whether their source is primarily of fetal or maternal origin. Serum samples and anthropometric measurements were obtained from the LIFE Child cohort of 79 healthy mother-child pairs. Measurements were conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Statistical analyses including Mann-Whitney U-test, correlation analyses and linear regression analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism and R. TGF beta 1 levels were significantly higher in cord than in maternal serum, suggesting a fetal origin. Multivariate regression analyses revealed strong positive associations between cord TGF fi1 levels at birth and child weight at U6. Furthermore, cord TGF beta 1 was significantly correlated with child weight at approximately one year of age. An increase of 10,000 pg/mL in cord TGF beta 1 concentrations at birth was associated with a higher body weight of 201 g at roughly one year of age when adjusted for sex.

AB  - Context Adipokines are a vast group of signalling proteins secreted primarily from adipose tissue. As modulators of metabolic products, they serve as potential prognostic markers of higher metabolic risk. Their likely role in fetal programming raises interest in their function during metabolic processes throughout pregnancy, particularly during pathological states. For instance, AFABP and adiponectin are possibly involved in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes. Unclear remains whether these adipokines are of maternal or fetal origin. Objective We aim to examine the levels of several adipokines in healthy maternal and fetal serum probes, in the interest of establishing standard values of adipokines during normal pregnancy. Furthermore, we seek to clarify the correlation of adipokine levels with associated parameters of intrauterine growth and determine whether their source is primarily fetal or maternal. Methods We investigated maternal serum adipokine levels at 36 weeks gestation and umbilical cord blood adipokine levels at birth in 79 healthy motherchild pairs. Measurements were conducted using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Moreover, we explored their correlation with parameters of child growth during the first two years of life. Preliminary Results Preliminary findings indicate that both AFABP and adiponectin are significantly increased in cord blood when compared to levels found in maternal serum. This would suggest fetal tissue as the primary source of these adipokines. In contrast, RBP4 and leptin levels were significantly decreased in cord blood in comparison to maternal serum. Further statistical evaluation is needed to determine the source of other adipokines and their correlation with parameters of intrauterine growth.

AB  - Adipokines are signaling proteins involved in metabolic, endocrinological, vascular and immunogenic processes. Associations of various adipokines with not only insulin resistance but also with increased insulin sensitivity, increased systolic blood pressure, and atherosclerosis highlight the significance of adipokines in several components of metabolic syndrome and metabolic diseases in general. As pregnancy presents a unique metabolic state, the role of adipokines in pregnancy, and even in various pregnancy complications, appears to be key to elucidating these metabolic processes. Many studies in recent years have attempted to clarify the role of adipokines in pregnancy and gestational pathologies. In this review, we aim to investigate the changes in maternal adipokine levels in physiological gestation, as well as the association of adipokines with pregnancy pathologies, such as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and preeclampsia (PE). Furthermore, we will analyze the association of adipokines in both maternal serum and cord blood with parameters of intrauterine growth and various pregnancy outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity may disrupt the developmental process of the fetus during gestation in rats. Recent evidence suggests that taurine can exert protective role against detrimental influence of obesogenic diets. This study aimed to examine the effect of maternal cafeteria diet and/or taurine supplementation on maternal dietary intake, plasma metabolites, fetal growth and development., METHODS: Female Wistar rats were fed a control diet (CON), CON supplemented with 1.5% taurine in drinking water (CONT), cafeteria diet (CAF) or CAF supplemented with taurine (CAFT) from weaning. After 8 weeks all animals were mated and maintained on the same diets during pregnancy and lactation., RESULTS: Dietary intakes were significantly different between the groups. Both CAF and CAFT fed dams consumed less water in comparison to CON and CONT dams. Taurine supplementation only increased plasma taurine concentrations in CONT group. Maternal plasma adiponectin concentrations increased in CAF and CAFT fed dams compared to CON and CONT fed dams and there was no effect of taurine. Hyperleptinemia was observed in CAF fed dams but not in CAFT fed dams. Malondialdehyde was significantly increased only in CAF fed dams. Litter size, sex ratio and birth weight were similar between the groups. There was an increase in neonatal mortality in CONT group., DISCUSSION: This study showed that maternal taurine supplementation exerted modest protective effects on cafeteria diet induced maternal obesity. The increased neonatal mortality in CONT neonates indicates possible detrimental effects of taurine supplementation in the setting of normal pregnancy. Therefore, future studies should investigate the optimal dose of taurine supplementation and long term potential effects on the offspring. Copyright © 2021 Kabasakal Cetin et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine the association of cord blood leptin with body mass index (BMI) growth velocity from birth to 12 months of age among infants exposed and not exposed to over-nutrition in utero (defined as maternal overweight/obesity or presence of gestational diabetes)., METHODS: 185 infants enrolled in the Exploring Perinatal Outcomes among Children study (76 exposed and 109 not exposed) had leptin and insulin measured in cord blood. Longitudinal weight and length measures in the first 12 months of life (average 4 per participant) obtained from medical records were used to compute BMI growth rates. Mixed models were used to examine associations of cord blood leptin with growth., RESULTS: Compared with unexposed infants, those exposed had significantly higher cord blood insulin (8.64 v. 6.97 uU/ml, P<0.01) and leptin levels (8.89 v. 5.92 ng/ml, P=0.05) as well as increased birth weights (3438.04 v. 3306.89 g, P=0.04). There was an inverse relationship between cord leptin levels and BMI growth from birth to 12 months of age (P=0.005); however, exposure to over-nutrition in utero did not significantly modify this association (P=0.59)., CONCLUSION: We provide support of a possible operational feedback mechanism by which lower cord blood leptin levels are associated with faster infant growth in the first year of life. Our data do not tend to support the hypothesis that this mechanism is altered in infants exposed to over-nutrition in utero; however our sample is too small to provide sufficient evidence. Larger epidemiological studies are needed to elucidate the mechanisms responsible for increased propensity for obesity in exposed offspring.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) has been identified as a risk factor for adult chronic kidney disease (CKD), including hypertension (HTN). Accelerated postnatal catch-up growth superimposed to IUGR has been shown to further increase the risk of CKD and HTN. Although the impact of excessive postnatal growth without previous IUGR is less clear, excessive postnatal overfeeding in experimental animals shows a strong impact on the risk of CKD and HTN in adulthood. On the other hand, food restriction in the postnatal period seems to have a protective effect on CKD programming. All these effects are mediated at least partially by the activation of the renin-angiotensin system, leptin and neuropeptide Y (NPY) signaling and profibrotic pathways. Early nutrition, especially in the postnatal period has a significant impact on the risk of CKD and HTN at adulthood and should receive specific attention in the prevention of CKD and HTN.

AB  - Context: Human milk contains hormones that regulate metabolism. Extrauterine growth restriction remains common among preterm infants, but the effect of ingesting milk hormones on preterm infant growth is poorly understood. Objective: To quantify associations of longitudinal exposure to leptin, adiponectin, and insulin in milk with physical growth of preterm infants. Design/Methods: In 50 preterm neonates (median gestational age 29.4 weeks), we sampled maternal milk on day-of-life 7, 14, 21, and 28 and measured hormone levels in whole milk by ELISA. Milk leptin levels were available for a subset of 18 infants. We calculated milk hormone doses by multiplying the hormone level by the milk volume ingested on each day and estimated the area under the curve (AUC) to reflect longitudinal exposure. We analyzed associations of milk hormone exposure with growth outcomes in generalized estimated equations. Main Outcome Measures: Weight gain velocity and z-scores in weight, length, head circumference, and body mass index at 36 weeks' postmenstrual age (PMA). Results: Higher leptin intake was associated with greater weight gain (2.17g/kg/day [95% CI, 1.31, 3.02]) and weight z-score at 36 weeks' PMA (0.30 [0.08, 0.53] higher z-score per tertile). Higher adiponectin intake was associated with greater length z-score (0.41 [0.13, 0.69]), however, this association was nullified after adjustment of protein and calorie intake. Higher adiponectin was associated with smaller head circumference z-score (-0.36 [-0.64, -0.07]). Insulin was not associated with growth outcomes. Conclusions: Milk leptin and adiponectin exposures may affect growth of preterm infants. The long-term effects of milk hormones warrant further investigation.

AB  - CONTEXT: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a group of conditions characterized by impaired social function and repetitive behaviors. Their etiology is largely unknown., OBJECTIVE: This work aims to examine the associations of maternal second-trimester and cord blood leptin and adiponectin levels with ASDs in offspring., METHODS: We used data from 1164 mother-child pairs enrolled in Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort. We used logistic regression analysis to examine the associations of leptin and adiponectin levels in maternal second-trimester blood and cord blood obtained at birth with ASDs. Additionally, we examined the association of maternal prepregnancy body mass index (BMI) as an exposure. Main outcome measures included doctor-diagnosed ASDs reported by mothers using questionnaires in midchildhood and early adolescence., RESULTS: The cumulative incidence of ASDs was 3.4%. Maternal prepregnancy BMI (per 5 points) was positively associated with ASDs in a logistic regression model adjusted for maternal race/ethnicity, education, smoking status and child sex (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 1.38; 95% CI, 1.06-1.79). Higher second-trimester adiponectin was associated with lower odds of ASD in offspring (unadjusted OR 0.49; 95% CI, 0.30-0.78; and OR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.32-0.91 after adjusting for maternal race/ethnicity, education, child sex, OR 0.55; 95% CI, 0.33-0.93 after adjusting for BMI, gestational weight gain, gestational diabetes, and smoking status). Maternal leptin and cord blood leptin and adiponectin levels were not associated with ASDs., CONCLUSION: Prepregnancy BMI and adiponectin during pregnancy may be useful as a tool to monitor the risk of autism. Increasing adiponectin levels prenatally may play a role in the prevention of ASDs. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Endocrine Society.

AB  - Context: Infants born small for gestational age (SGA) have increased risk for obesity and metabolic syndrome, but the underlying mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein (AFABP) is an adipokine that has been implicated in modulation of insulin sensitivity and lipid metabolism. Higher plasma AFABP levels are associated with increased risk of metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular morbidity in adults. Alterations in AFABP levels during fetal growth have not been characterized., Objective: To examine AFABP levels in neonatal cord blood in relation to gestational age and birth weight., Design: A cross-sectional study of 361 neonates born at a tertiary academic center., Outcome Measures: Plasma AFABP levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. For comparison, venous samples from 26 adults were analyzed., Results: AFABP levels were higher in neonates compared with adults (P < 0.01). Preterm infants had higher AFABP levels [48.2 (31.2 to 73.3) ng/mL] compared with full-term infants [35.8 (25.1 to 51.5)] ng/mL, P < 0.01). There was a negative correlation between AFABP and gestational age (r = 0.28, P = 0.02). Among full-term infants, AFABP levels in SGA infants were lower [28.6 (24.2 to 37.3) ng/mL], compared with appropriate for gestational age [36.1 (25.5 to 50.4) ng/mL] and large for gestational age infants [45.0 (24.6 to 62.4) ng/mL, P < 0.05]., Conclusions: These associations may reflect the higher metabolic activity during fetal development. AFABP may also be involved in fetal growth and the association between SGA status and obesity and metabolic syndrome in later life. Copyright © 2017 by the Endocrine Society

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased adiposity at birth may identify infants at high risk of developing obesity. Maternal obesity and hyperglycemia in pregnancy are associated with increased neonatal adiposity; however, features of maternal obesity that contribute to increased neonatal adiposity need further study., AIMS: To measure adiposity in neonates of obese and normal-weight women without gestational diabetes to test the hypothesis that obese women have neonates with increased adiposity compared to neonates of normal-weight women., METHODS: Sixty-one pregnant women, with a normal or obese BMI, and their neonates participated in this cross-sectional study at an academic medical center. Neonatal adiposity, expressed as percent body fat (fat mass/body mass), was measured by air displacement plethysmography and cord blood was assayed for biomarkers., RESULTS: Adiposity in neonates of obese and normal-weight mothers did not differ. Stratifying mothers by leptin level showed that neonates born to mothers with higher leptin had significantly higher adiposity (13.2 vs. 11.1%, p = 0.035). In the entire cohort, adiposity positively correlated with cord blood leptin (r = 0.48, p < 0.001) and adiponectin (r = 0.27, p = 0.04) levels., CONCLUSION: Obesity in normoglycemic pregnant women was not associated with increased neonatal adiposity. High maternal leptin levels identified neonates with increased adiposity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low birth weight is associated with increased rates of obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, but the precise mechanisms for this association remain unclear. We aimed to assess the relationships between birth weight and markers of glucose homeostasis or obesity in adults., METHODS: Cross-sectional population-based study on 1458 women and 1088 men aged 35-75 years living in Lausanne, Switzerland. Birth weight was self-reported and categorized into <= 2.5, 2.6-3.5, 3.6-4.0 and >4.0 kg. Body composition was assessed by bioimpedance. Leptin and adiponectin levels were measured by ELISA., RESULTS: Women with low birth weight (<= 2.5 kg) had higher levels of fasting plasma glucose, insulin, HOMA, diabetes and metabolic syndrome; a non significant similar trend was seen in men. In both genders, height increased with birth weight, whereas a U-shaped association was found between birth weight and body mass index, waist circumference and body fat percentage. After adjusting for age, smoking status, physical activity and fat mass, an inverse association was found between leptin and birth weight categories: adjusted mean +/- standard error 17.3 +/- 0.7, 16.2 +/- 0.3, 15.6 +/- 0.5 and 14.0 +/- 0.8 ng/dL for birth weight categories <= 2.5, 2.6-3.5, 3.6-4.0 and >4.0 kg, respectively, in women (p < 0.05) and 9.8 +/- 0.8, 9.1 +/- 03, 7.8 +/- 0.4 and 7.7 +/- 0.5 ng/dL in men (p < 0.05). An inverse association was also found between reported birth weight and leptin to fat mass ratio: mean +/- standard error 0.77 +/- 0.04, 0.73 +/- 0.02, 0.69 +/- 0.03 and 0.62 +/- 0.04 in women (p < 0.05); 0.46 +/- 0.05, 0.45 +/- 0.02, 0.39 +/- 0.02 and 0.38 +/- 0.03 in men (p < 0.05). No differences in adiponectin levels were found between birth weight groups., CONCLUSIONS: Middle-aged adults born with a low weight present a higher prevalence of diabetes and obesity and also higher leptin levels and leptin to fat mass ratio than adults born with a normal weight. The higher leptin levels and leptin to fat mass ratio among adults born with a low weight might be related to nutritional factors during childhood or to the development of leptin resistance and/or higher leptin production by body fat unit. Subjects born with a low weight should be counselled regarding the risks of developing diabetes and/or cardiovascular disease.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Low birthweight (LBW) increases the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Few studies have established its impact at early ages., AIMS: To study endothelial function (EF) and arterial stiffness (AS) and their relationship to early markers of CVD risk in children with LBW., METHODS: In children with LBW (4-6 years; n = 53), anthropometric, haemodynamic and laboratory parameters, including HOMA-IR, hs-CRP, adiponectin and leptin, were determined. EF and AS were evaluated by digital pulse plethysmography. Data were compared with a control group (n = 33)., RESULTS: In both groups, anthropometric parameters remained within normal limits. Insulin and HOMA-IR had normal values, but they were significantly augmented in LBW children. LBW children showed higher leptin and hs-CRP levels than the control group. The LBW group had decreased EF (37.5 +/- 5.6%) compared with the control group (75.0 +/- 11.9%; p < 0.01), however without differences in AS. In LBW children, EF was negatively correlated with waist circumference, leptin, hs-CRP and with a cumulative score of risk factors., CONCLUSIONS: LBW children display altered EF that is related to early changes in CVD risk factors. The differences found in the metabolic parameters might indicate a pro-inflammatory state. This hypothesis is also supported by the laboratory findings and the correlation between EF and the number of CVD risk factors, suggesting that very early lifestyle interventions may be needed.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the use of surrogate plasma fatty acid analysis to provide further insights into the underlying adiposity and the development of metabolic syndrome in men with spinal cord injury (SCI). Design: Case-control, cross-sectional study. Setting: Community-based individuals with spinal cord injury and healthy controls. Participants: Twenty men with SCI age, height and weight matched with 20 able-bodied controls. Outcome Measures: Lean tissue (LTM) and fat mass (FM) were determined using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Fasting blood samples were taken for analysis of fatty acids, adiponectin, insulin, glucose and leptin. Enzymatic indices were calculated using relevant fatty acids. Results: Total FM, leptin, stearoyl coenzyme A desaturase (SCD) Delta 9 (SCD-16, 16:1/16:0, and SCD-18, 18:1/18:0) indices and Delta 6 desaturase index were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in the SCI group than the controls. Significant differences between the groups was observed for several individual fatty acids. Correlational analysis revealed a different pattern between blood biomarkers and indices of SCDs, de novo lipogenesis and elongase. Associations between the desaturase and elongase indices and biomarkers in the controls followed those reported elsewhere for able bodied participants; the same associations were not observed in the SCI group. Conclusion: We have identified disturbances in fatty acid biosynthesis in SCI individuals likely associated with the development of adipose tissue below the lesion and a decrease in LTM. Loss of LTM may disturb the normal skeletal muscle-fatty acid metabolic processes leading to the disruption of metabolic homeostasis, previously identified in persons with SCI.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) is a severe cardiovascular malformation (CVM) associated with fetal growth abnormalities. Genetic and environmental factors have been identified that contribute to pathogenesis, but the role of the placenta is unknown. The purpose of this study was to systematically examine the placenta in HLHS with and without growth abnormalities., METHODS: HLHS term singleton births were identified from a larger cohort when placenta tissue was available. Clinical data were collected from maternal and neonatal medical records, including anthropometrics and placental pathology reports. Placental tissues from cases and controls were analyzed to assess parenchymal morphology, vascular architecture and leptin signaling., RESULTS: HLHS cases (n = 16) and gestational age-matched controls (n = 18) were analyzed. Among cases, the average birth weight was 2993 g, including 31% that were small for gestational age. When compared with controls, gross pathology of HLHS cases demonstrated significantly reduced placental weight and increased fibrin deposition, while micropathology showed increased syncytial nuclear aggregates, decreased terminal villi, reduced vasculature and increased leptin expression in syncytiotrophoblast and endothelial cells., DISCUSSION: Placentas from pregnancies complicated by fetal HLHS are characterized by abnormal parenchymal morphology, suggesting immature structure may be due to vascular abnormalities. Increased leptin expression may indicate an attempt to compensate for these vascular abnormalities. Further investigation into the regulation of angiogenesis in the fetus and placenta may elucidate the causes of HLHS and associated growth abnormalities in some cases. Copyright © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Teenagers are susceptible to delivering small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. Previous studies suggest that maternal growth may contribute, as a result of preferential nutrient partitioning to the mother. We investigated the impact of maternal growth on birthweight in pregnant teenagers in the UK, and examined endocrine mediators of nutrient partitioning., DESIGN: A prospective observational multicentre study, About Teenage Eating, conducted between 2004 and 2007., SETTING: Four hospitals in socially-deprived areas of Manchester and London., POPULATION: A total of 500 pregnant adolescents (14-18 years of age) with a singleton pregnancy were recruited at 10-21 weeks of gestation, with follow-up studies on 368 subjects. A cohort of 80 pregnant adults (25-40 years of age) provided a control group for determining growth., METHODS: Skeletal growth, weight gain and skinfold thickness were measured from first to third trimester, together with maternal levels of micronutrients and metabolic hormones: insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system and leptin. Dietary analyses were performed., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: SGA birth., RESULTS: Maternal growth was not associated with SGA birth: growing mothers delivered more large-for-gestational-age infants (OR 2.51; P < 0.05). Growers had greater weight gain (P < 0.001), fat accrual (P < 0.001) and red cell folate concentrations (P < 0.01) than non-growers. Maternal IGF-I (P < 0.01) and leptin (P < 0.001) were positively associated with maternal and fetal growth, whereas IGF-I (P < 0.001) was negatively associated. Teenagers that were underweight at booking or with low weight gain were at greater risk of SGA birth., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal growth was not detrimental to fetal growth in this UK population of teenagers. Greater weight gain and higher concentrations of IGF-I in growing teenagers may provide anabolic drive for maternal and fetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In this study, we assess the impact of obesity and diabetes on maternal brain and periphery, as well as fetal exposure to insulin and leptin, and two hormones that play an important role in regulating energy homeostasis., STUDY DESIGN: Fasting maternal plasma, fetal cord vein and artery plasma, and maternal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were collected in 37 women (12 lean, nondiabetic [prepregnancy body mass index (BMI): 22.9 +/- 1.7 kg/m2]; 12 overweight/obese nondiabetic [BMI: 37.8 +/- 7.3 kg/m2]; 13 gestational/type 2 diabetes mellitus [BMI: 29.8 +/- 7.3 kg/m2]) with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies undergoing elective Cesarean delivery. HbA1C, insulin, glucose, and leptin levels were measured., RESULTS: Compared with lean mothers, mothers with obesity and diabetes mellitus (DM) had significantly lower CSF-to-plasma ratios of insulin. Moreover, mothers with obesity and DM had significantly lower cord arterial and cord venous to maternal plasma ratios of insulin, but not leptin, compared with lean mothers. There were no differences in CSF and cord blood insulin and leptin levels between obese and DM mothers., CONCLUSION: Compared with lean individuals, mothers with obesity and DM have relative deficiencies in insulin exposure. The patterns observed in mothers with obesity and diabetes were similar highlighting the importance of the maternal metabolic environment in obesity and suggesting obese patients warrant further clinical focus.

AB  - Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDC) have received considerable attention as potential obesogens. Past studies examining obesogenic potential of one widespread EDC, bisphenol A (BPA), have generally focused on metabolic and adipose tissue effects. However, physical inactivity has been proposed to be a leading cause of obesity. A paucity of studies has considered whether EDC, including BPA, affects this behavior. To test whether early exposure to BPA and ethinyl estradiol (EE, estrogen present in birth control pills) results in metabolic and such behavioral disruptions, California mice developmentally exposed to BPA and EE were tested as adults for energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry), body composition (echoMRI) and physical activity (measured by beam breaks and voluntary wheel running). Serum glucose and metabolic hormones were measured. No differences in body weight or food consumption were detected. BPA-exposed females exhibited greater variation in weight than females in control and EE groups. During the dark and light cycles, BPA females exhibited a higher average respiratory quotient than control females, indicative of metabolizing carbohydrates rather than fats. Various assessments of voluntary physical activity in the home cage confirmed that during the dark cycle, BPA and EE-exposed females were significantly less active in this setting than control females. Similar effects were not observed in BPA or EE-exposed males. No significant differences were detected in serum glucose, insulin, adiponectin and leptin concentrations. Results suggest that females developmentally exposed to BPA exhibit decreased motivation to engage in voluntary physical activity and altered metabolism of carbohydrates v. fats, which could have important health implications.

AB  - Using crossed starch gel immunoelectrophoresis with rabbit anti-Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein (Zn-alpha 2-GP) immune serum and planimetric evaluation of antigen-antibody precipitation peak area, human serum Zn-alpha 2-GP was found to consist of four major antigenically identical components (A, B, C, D), the mean concentrations of which were 8.3 +/- 3.5 mg/l (A), 27.1 +/- 3.0 mg/l (B), 38.7 +/- 3.4 mg/l (C) and 11.1 +/- 3.5 mg/l (D). The mean relative percentages of individual Zn-alpha 2-GP components were 9.7 +/- 4.0% (A), 31.8 +/- 3.4% (B), 45.4 +/- 5.2% (C) and 13.0 +/- 4.0% (D). The concentrations of human serum Zn-alpha 2-GP components A, B and C increase from the lowest values in the fetal and early newborn period to the highest ones in children and adults. During ontogenesis, the mean relative percentages of the Zn-alpha 2-GP components A and B increase while those of the Zn-alpha 2-GP components C and D decrease simultaneously. The anodal mobility of the Zn-alpha 2-GP components decreases after treatment with neuraminidase. The pattern of the Zn-alpha 2-GP components in human serum was found to be very similar to that in human urine and amniotic fluid.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Low birthweight (LBW) and rapid postnatal weight gain, or catch-up growth, are independent risk factors for the development of obesity and diabetes during adult life. Individuals who are both small at birth and have postnatal catch-up growth are at the highest risk. We hypothesised that dietary interventions designed to attenuate catch-up growth in LBW subjects may have long-term beneficial consequences., MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used our previously described mouse model of LBW-associated diabetes, created by restricting maternal food intake to 50% during the last week of gestation. Control (C) dams and dams that had been subjected to undernutrition (U) were then provided either chow ad libitum after delivery or 50% food restriction on a per-day basis from delivery until weaning. We designated the resulting four groups control-control (CC), undernutrition-control (UC), control-undernutriton (CU) and undernutrition-undernutrition (UU), indicating the prenatal and postnatal experimental conditions, respectively. Carbohydrate metabolism and adiposity were assessed prospectively in offspring until age 6 months., RESULTS: Males that were small at birth and exhibited early postnatal catch-up growth developed glucose intolerance and obesity by age 6 months. In contrast, LBW mice without catch-up growth (UU) remained smaller than controls (CC), and glucose intolerance and obesity was prevented. Similarly, mice with normal birthweight that had blunted catch-up growth (CU) were leaner and had better tolerance test than CC mice. Catch-up growth during the first week of life correlated better than birthweight with glucose, fat mass and glucose tolerance up to 6 months of age., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Prevention of early catch-up growth reversed the development of glucose intolerance and obesity in our mouse model of LBW-associated diabetes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes during pregnancy affects placental mitochondrial content and function, which has the potential to impact fetal development and the long-term health of offspring. Resistin is a peptide hormone originally discovered in mice as an adipocyte-derived factor that induced insulin resistance. In humans, resistin is primarily secreted by monocytes or macrophages. The regulation and roles of human resistin in diabetes during pregnancy remain unclear., METHODS: Fetal resistin levels were measured in cord blood from pregnancies with (n = 42) and without maternal diabetes (n = 81). Secretion of resistin from cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) was measured. The actions of human resistin in mitochondrial biogenesis were determined in placental trophoblastic cells (BeWo cells) or human placental explant., RESULTS: Concentrations of human resistin in cord sera were higher in diabetic pregnancies (67 ng/ml) compared to healthy controls (50 ng/ml, P < 0.05), and correlated (r = 0.4, P = 0.002) with a measure of maternal glycemia (glucose concentration 2 h post challenge). Resistin mRNA was most abundant in cord blood mononuclear cells (CBMCs) compared with placenta and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Secretion of resistin from cultured CBMCs was increased in response to high glucose (25 mM). Exposing BeWo cells or human placental explant to resistin decreased expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma coactivator 1-alpha (PGC-1alpha), mitochondrial abundance, and ATP production., CONCLUSIONS: Resistin is increased in fetal circulation of infants exposed to the diabetic milieu, potentially reflecting a response of monocytes/macrophages to hyperglycemia and metabolic stresses associated with diabetes during pregnancy. Increased exposure to resistin may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction and aberrant energy metabolism characteristic of offspring exposed to diabetes in utero.

AB  - Adiponectin and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were both related to cardiovascular disease. Patients with cardiovascular disease are characterized by hypoadiponectinemia and EPCs number decrease in the circulation. Adiponectin is correlated with EPCs. It was found that adiponectin can promote EPCs proliferation, whereas mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway is closely associated with cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Thus, this study aimed to clarify the role of mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway in adiponectin promoting EPCs proliferation by culturing EPCs in umbilical cord blood and detecting p-mTOR and p-STAT3 protein level. Ficoll density gradient centrifugation was applied to collect mononuclear cells from human umbilical cord blood. Flow cytometry was performed to identify cell phenotype after adherent culture screening. CCK8 was used to test cell proliferation, and Western blot was used to detect p-mTOR and p-STAT3 protein expression level. To further verify mTOR/STAT3 effect, the cells were divided into control, rapamycin group, adiponectin group, and rapamycin + adiponectin group. The cells proportion with CD34(+), CD133(+), CD31(+), and KDR+ positive surface markers were 68.12 +/- 7.68%, 18.65 +/- 4.24%, 5.42 +/- 6.43%, and 86.25 +/- 7.56%, respectively. Adiponectin may promote EPCs proliferation with time and dose dependent. P-mTOR and p-STAT3 protein level increased following adiponectin concentration. mTOR inhibitor rapamycin can suppress adiponectin induced EPCs proliferation. Rapamycin weakened adiponectin facilitating effect on p-mTOR and p-STAT3 protein expression in EPCs. Adiponectin can regulate EPCs proliferation through mTOR/STAT3 signaling pathway.

AB  - Purpose of reviewThis review provides readers with current management guidelines for labor and birth for individuals with obesity and includes a summary of methods for lowering the risk for cesarean birth. The goal of this review was to examine the evidence for women with obesity having uncomplicated labor courses and to apply the concept of metabolically healthy obesity to cesarean birth reduction.Recent findingsOne-fifth to one-third of those in labor will have a pregnancy complicated by obesity. A variety of adipokines produced in excess adipose tissue counteract the normal physiology of labor and increase systemic inflammation. Those with obesity but without co-morbid diseases such as diabetes and hypertension have high rates of uncomplicated pregnancy and birth and lower cesarean section rates, particularly if they are younger and multiparous.Optimal labor outcomes begin during antenatal care with guidance in appropriate weight gain and regular physical activity. Antenatal education tailored to the obesity class and metabolic health of the client should prepare those at risk for the possibility of early induction of labor, longer labors, and cesarean birth. Individuals with metabolically healthy obesity can safely give birth in low-risk units, particularly if multiparous. A team approach to cesarean reduction is needed, with all providers understanding physiologic support of birth including admission in active labor, physical activity during labor, intermittent auscultation, and patience with the length of labor. Those with obesity deserve labor and birth management that begins with a wholistic health assessment followed by a thoughtful application of national guidelines to reduce risks for cesarean birth while preserving optimal perinatal outcomes.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate adipokines concentration and insulin resistance according to maternal age or obesity at pregnancy and weight change at diagnosed gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnant women with GDM. Methods: This study included 57 pregnant women who were diagnosed with GDM at 24 to 28 weeks of gestation. The subjects were classified into two or three groups according to pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI, < 25 kg/m(2) vs. >= 25 kg/m(2)), maternal age at pregnancy (<35 years old vs. >= 35 years old), and weight change during pregnancy at screening for GDM (weight change below, within, and in excess of the recommended range). They were respectively compared in each group. Results: Leptin, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and HOMA2-%B were increased in the group with pre-pregnancy BMI >= 25 kg/m(2). Leptin and HOMA-IR were positively correlated with BMI both before pregnancy and at screening for GDM. There were no significant correlations between HOMA-IR and adipokines. HOMA-IR showed positive correlation with HOMA2-%B and negative correlation with HOMA2-%S. Conclusion: Leptin and HOMA-IR at diagnosed GDM were increased in the GDM patients with obesity before pregnancy. They were positively correlated with BMI both before pregnancy and at screening for GDM. The effect of maternal age at pregnancy and weight change during pregnancy at GDM screening on adipokines and insulin resistance might be less pronounced than the effect of maternal obesity.

AB  - Leptin concentrations were measured in African American women in order to assess leptin's role in the increased frequency and severity of preeclampsia. In addition, leptin concentrations were measured in women who delivered small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants. A case-control study of African American and Caucasian women with normal pregnancies, preeclampsia, or SGA infants was done. Plasma leptin was quantitated by radio-immunoassay. The previously recognized pattern of increased leptin concentrations in preeclampsia was replicated. Leptin concentrations did not differ by race in any diagnostic category, and concentrations in women with SGA infants were not higher than those in healthy women. Differences in the frequency and severity of preeclampsia in African Americans cannot be explained by higher leptin concentrations.

An indirect regulator of glucose metabolism, adiponectin increases insulin sensitivity, improves glucose tolerance and inhibits inflammation. Plasma adiponectin relates inversely to adiposity and, importantly, reflects the sequelae of accumulation of excess adiposity. The role of adiponectin in adults has been explored in detail. Studies in children are now available and, given the increasing rates of childhood obesity, it is important to establish the role of adiponectin in mediating insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease in this age group. This paper reviews the regulation of adiponectin, its effect on body mass, glucose metabolism and cardiovascular risk in infants, children and adolescents. It demonstrates clear links between adiponectin and features of the metabolic syndrome in obese children and adolescents. However, adiponectin's role as a predictor of metabolic dysfunction in healthy, normal-weight youngsters is less clear.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited studies are available on fetal oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction and their association with adverse fetal outcomes in hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). Method: Umbilical cord blood samples were collected at delivery from 134 pregnant women with HDP and 59 controls. Markers of oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation and adipokines were analyzed. Results were correlated with adverse fetal outcomes. Results: Malondialdehyde, total antioxidant status(TAS), ADMA and hsCRP levels were increased in late and early onset preeclampsia. Adiponectin levels were decreased in early onset preeclampsia. High ADMA levels were positively associated with preterm births and fetal mortality and high TAS, protein carbonyl content(PC), ADMA and low adiponectin levels were positively associated with low birth weight babies. Conclusion: Fetal systemic oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction and inflammation were altered in early and late onset preeclampsia. High TAS, PC and ADMA levels and low adiponectin levels were positively associated with adverse fetal outcomes in HDP.

AB  - Evidence is accumulating that the risk of osteoporosis in later life may be determined in part by environmental influences on bone development during intrauterine and early postnatal life. A potential role for fetal leptin in mediating these effects is suggested by animal studies showing that leptin influences prenatal osteoblast growth and development, and that fetal leptin concentrations are altered by changes in maternal nutrition. In a group of term human infants we reported previously that maternal birthweight, smoking, fat mass, and exercise during late pregnancy independently predict neonatal bone mass. To investigate the potential role of leptin in mediating these effects, we now relate leptin concentrations in umbilical venous serum to neonatal bone mass and body composition in 117 infants. There were strong positive associations between umbilical venous leptin concentration and each of whole body bone mineral contents (BMC) (r = 0.42, P < or = 0.001) and estimated volumetric bone density (r = 0.21, P = 0.02); whole body lean mass (r = 0.21, P < or = 0.024); and whole body fat mass (r = 0.60, P < 0.001). The associations with neonatal BMC and fat mass, but not with lean mass, were independent of associations that we have reported previously between cord serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) concentrations and neonatal body composition. Among the maternal determinants of neonatal bone mass, cord leptin explained the relationship with maternal fat stores, but not those with the mother's own birthweight, smoking, or physical activity. We conclude that umbilical venous leptin predicts both the size of the neonatal skeleton and its estimated volumetric mineral density. In addition, among previously documented maternal determinants of neonatal bone mass in healthy pregnancies, maternal fat stores may mediate their effect on fetal bone accrual through variation in fetal leptin concentrations.

AB  - AIMS: Adiponectin and leptin are members of the adipocytokine family. Adiponectin promotes and leptin inhibits apoptosis and both are regulators of angiogenesis. Adipocytokines and their receptors are expressed in the placenta, and in the pre-eclamptic (PE) mother the serum levels of both are higher than in healthy ones. Our aim was to study the expression of adiponectin, leptin, their receptor genes and apoptosis in severely PE and normal placentas., METHODS: The study group comprised 13 PE mothers and their 16 healthy controls. Placental biopsies were taken during cesarean section, the RNA was extracted and micro-array study was performed, followed by PCR and apoptosis studies., RESULTS: The placental expression level of the leptin and adiponectin receptor 1 genes was significantly higher in PE mothers than in controls. No significant changes were observed in the levels of the adiponectin, adiponectin receptor 2 and Leptin receptor genes. The expression of the Adiponectin gene was low. The rate of apoptosis was higher in the PE placentas., CONCLUSIONS: The activity of placental adipocytokines and their receptor genes in severe PE may suggest an important role in placental angiogenesis. Placental apoptosis induced by adiponectin could be mediated via the ADIPOR1-receptor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deleterious long-term effects in the offspring from women with pregravid obesity have been described; however, the evidence supporting early metabolic and inflammatory markers in the offspring at birth and gender differences are conflicting., OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to compare cord blood adipokines and cytokines concentrations and anthropometric characteristics of the offspring of women with maternal obesity (MO) and normal-weight mothers (NWM). Also, maternal and neonatal variables on the association of maternal body mass index (BMI) with cord blood adipokines were evaluated., METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis of a subsample of mother-child dyads participating in a cohort study (n = 221) was assessed. Anthropometrics, cord blood adipokines (leptin and adiponectin) and cytokines (interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 p40, IL-12p70, IL-13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha) concentrations in the offspring of normal-weight women (BMI >18.5 and <24.9 kg/m2) and women with pregravid obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m2) without comorbidities was performed., RESULTS: Offspring from mothers with obesity had higher birth weight, a higher proportion of large for gestational age, higher ponderal index, and heavier placentae than offspring from normal-weight mothers (P < 0.05). Within the offspring from women with obesity, males had significantly higher weight, length, the proportion of large-for-gestational-age newborns, higher weight for length ratio. Males had more efficient placentas than females (P < 0.05). Higher adiponectin and leptin in both sexes and higher leptin in female offspring of mothers with obesity after adjusting for birth size (P < 0.05) were found. Higher IL-12p40 in the offspring of women with MO with no other differences in other cytokines among groups were evidenced., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity associates with a higher concentration of adiponectin and leptin in their offspring at birth. There is a relevant effect on anthropometrics in male offspring and on leptin in female newborn. Further studies need to evaluate the extension of these effects in postnatal life., TRAIL IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: NCT02903134.

AB  - Adiponectin and leptin are hormones known to play roles in maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Levels of these hormones have been demonstrated to vary based on adiposity and race. However, there is a lack of data concerning the relationship between race and the change of adiponectin and leptin throughout pregnancy. The purpose of this study was to examine serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, and leptin-to-adiponectin ratio (LAR) throughout pregnancy and to assess their association with gestational weight gain (GWG) and infant birth weight while considering the effects of race and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI). Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, gestational weight gain, and infant birth weight were measured in 80 pregnant women at early (12.4 +/- 1.3 weeks gestation), mid (20.6 +/- 1.3 weeks gestation), late pregnancy (29.2 +/- 1.4 weeks gestation), and 7-11 weeks postpartum (8.8 +/- 0.8 weeks). In women overall, serum adiponectin decreased across pregnancy and increased at postpartum (p = 0.17.) At each prenatal timepoint, both black race and obesity were associated with lower adiponectin (ps < 0.05). In women overall, serum leptin increased across pregnancy, and declined at postpartum. At every assessment, a stepwise increase in leptin was observed in relation to BMI class. Black women with obesity had markedly higher LAR in mid- and late pregnancy and postpartum than all other groups (p < 0.05). Serum leptin during pregnancy was significantly associated with total GWG in both black and white women (ps < 0.005). Neither adiponectin, leptin, nor LAR were associated with infant birth weight. Race and BMI both have significant effects on serum adiponectin, leptin, and LAR levels in pregnancy and postpartum. Notably, the combined effects of race and BMI result in markedly higher LAR among black women with obesity. Implications for racial disparities in metabolic syndrome and postpartum weight retention remain to be explicated. Copyright © 2020 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Increasing evidence point to the role of the adipose tissue on the insulin resistance associated with reduced fetal growth. Since adiponectin, exclusively produced by the adipose tissue, exerts an important insulin-sensitizing activity, it appears critical to investigate the effect of being born small for gestational age (SGA) on adiponectin production in adulthood and its relationship with insulin sensitivity., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Serum adiponectin concentrations were measured in 486 young adults born SGA, precisely selected on birth data, who were compared to 573 age-matched subjects born appropriate for gestational age (AGA). The relationship between serum adiponectin levels and insulin-resistance indices measured under OGTT were tested and compared between the two groups., RESULTS: The SGA group demonstrated significantly reduced serum adiponectin levels than controls (12.6 +/- 6.9 vs 13.2 +/- 6.4 microg/ml, P = 0.02) and the difference remained significant when the key regulatory factors were taken into account (P = 0.008). In the AGA group, fasting I/G taken as an insulin-resistance index negatively correlated with serum adiponectin concentrations (P = 0.02), while the relationship followed a U-shape with increased fasting I/G ratio despite high concentrations of serum adiponectin in the SGA group (P = 0.12)., CONCLUSION: Subjects born SGA demonstrated significantly reduced serum adiponectin levels, which were not related to insulin-resistance indices in comparison to what observed in age-matched subjects born AGA. Although this defect in adiponectin production and in its insulin-sensitizing action remains to be elucidated at the molecular level, it strengthens the critical contribution of the adipose tissue in the metabolic complications associated with reduced fetal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In-utero under-nutrition dramatically alters the development of adipose tissue, during the fetal and the neonatal period., THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate whether adults born with intra-uterine growth retardation (IUGR) show evidence of impaired adipose tissue development and leptin regulation., DESIGN: Serum leptin concentrations were measured in 26 healthy adults born with IUGR and 25 controls aged 24 y who have been studied previously, 3 y ago., RESULTS: The IUGR group demonstrated a significant increase of body mass index (BMI) in comparison to controls between 21 and 24 y of age (4.8+/-7.7%, P=0.004 vs 0.8+/-6.7%, P=0.70). Percentage of total body fat mass was significantly higher in IUGR-born subjects than in controls (27.2+/-7.6 vs 22.0+/-7.3%, P=0.02). Fasting insulin was significantly higher in the IUGR group (7.5+/-3.8 vs 5.3+/-2.3 miccroU/ml, P=0.03). Surprisingly, crude serum leptin concentrations did not significantly differ between the two groups. Moreover, adjusted means of serum leptin levels were significantly lower in IUGR-born subjects than in controls when corrected for body fat mass, gender and fasting insulin (11.3 vs 13.8 ng/ml, P=0.02)., SUMMARY: Adults born with IUGR developed an excess of adipose tissue associated with relatively low serum leptin levels suggestive of an altered adipocyte function. Considering the close relationship between adipose tissue and insulin-sensitivity, these observations point to the potential implication of abnormal adipose tissue development in the long-term metabolic consequences associated with in-utero undernutrition.

AB  - The aim of the study was to investigate how leptin could be involved in catch-up growth of children born with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). The study population was made up of 70 newborns with IUGR longitudinally studied during the first 2 yr of life and 35 newborns and 32, 66, and 61 children with normal birth weight aged 3 days, 12 months, and 24 months, respectively. Postnatal patterns of body mass index (BMI) were similar in the 2 groups, but BMI remained significantly lower in IUGR over the study period. In contrast, children born with IUGR aged 1 yr had significantly higher serum leptin levels than normal children (P < 0.0001) independently of BMI. The correlation observed between BMI and serum leptin at birth in both groups and in the control group thereafter disappeared in children born with IUGR. Similarly, sexual dimorphism observed in normal children over the study period was not observed in the IUGR group during the first 2 yr of life. In summary, serum leptin is effective and regulated during the first years of life as it is in older children. Children born with IUGR demonstrate high serum leptin values during the first year of life, with a loss of the regulatory effect of BMI and gender. We suggest that these children develop an adaptative leptin resistance beneficial for their catch-up growth. An alternative hypothesis is that these observations could reflect an adipocyte dysfunction, a consequence of the special time course of adipose tissue development in children born with IUGR.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the ontogeny of serum leptin concentrations during the second half of gestation and at birth in small for gestational age and normal fetuses and newborns. Serum leptin concentrations were measured in arterial cord blood of fetuses (n = 79) and newborns (n = 132), with or without intrauterine growth retardation, at 18-42 weeks gestation. Serum leptin was detectable in fetal cord blood in all subjects as early as 18 weeks gestation. Leptin levels dramatically increased after 34 weeks gestation. In newborns, serum leptin concentrations were positively correlated with body weight (P < 0.001) and body mass index (P < 0.001). Newborns with intrauterine growth retardation had significantly lower serum leptin values (P < 0.001) than those with normal growth, and leptin levels were only positively correlated with body mass index (P < 0.001). These results suggest that the development of adipose tissue and the accumulation of fat mass are the major determinants of fetal and neonatal serum leptin levels. In addition, a gender difference, with higher leptin concentrations in female fetuses, was observed during the last weeks of gestation and was confirmed at birth regardless of growth status, suggesting that a sexual dimorphism already exists in utero.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early-life metabolic derangements in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants have been reported., METHODS: Pregnant women with HIV and HIV-uninfected pregnant women were enrolled with their newborns in a US cohort from 2011 to 2015. We measured cord insulin, C-peptide, and metabolic cytokines of HEU and HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) newborns using ELISA and metabolites, lipid subspecies, and eicosanoids via liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Linear regression was employed to assess the association of intrauterine HIV/ART with insulin and C-peptide. Graphical lasso regression was used to identify differences between metabolite/lipid subspecies networks associated with C-peptide., RESULTS: Of 118 infants, 56 were HEU, ART exposed. In adjusted analyses, mean cord insulin (beta = 0.295, p = 0.03) and C-peptide (beta = 0.522, p < 0.01) were significantly higher in HEU vs. HUU newborns. HEU neonates exhibited primarily positive associations between complex lipids and C-peptide, indicative of fuel storage, and augmented associations between cord eicosanoids and cytokines. HUU neonates exhibited negative associations with lipids and C-peptide indicative of increased fuel utilization., CONCLUSION: Higher cord insulin and C-peptide in HEU vs. HUU newborns as well as differences in cord metabolites, metabolic-related cytokines, and eicosanoids may reflect a propensity for fuel storage and an inflammatory milieu suggestive of fetal metabolic changes associated with in utero HIV/ART exposure., IMPACT: There is a paucity of studies assessing cord blood and neonatal metabolic health in HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) newborns, an increasing population worldwide. Compared to HIV-unexposed uninfected (HUU) newborns, HEU newborns exhibit alterations in fuel homeostasis and an inflammatory milieu associated with in utero HIV/antiretroviral therapy (ART) exposure. The long-term implications of these neonatal findings are as yet unknown, but merit continued evaluation as this important and growing population ages into adulthood. Copyright © 2021.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obese women often give birth to large-for-gestational age infants (typically defined as a birth weight greater than the 90th percentile), who are at risk of birth injuries and of developing metabolic syndrome later in life. The mechanisms underlying increased fetal growth remain to be established., OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify maternal hormones that can explain the link between dietary intake, body mass index (BMI), and birth weight., DESIGN: Pregnant women with BMIs (in kg/m(2)) ranging from 17 to 44 (n = 49) were recruited in gestational weeks 8-12. Serum hormone concentrations were measured and dietary history interviews were performed in the first and third trimesters. Multiple regression models were produced to identify hormones that correlate with birth weight and are influenced by BMI or dietary factors., RESULTS: We found a strong positive correlation between BMI and first- and third-trimester insulin and leptin concentrations and a negative correlation between BMI and first-trimester adiponectin and first- and third-trimester insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1). Maternal total fat intake in the first trimester was positively correlated with maternal leptin and inversely correlated with adiponectin. In addition, third-trimester total fat intake was positively correlated with circulating resistin concentrations. First-trimester maternal serum resistin was positively correlated with birth weight, whereas third-trimester maternal IGFBP-1 was negatively correlated with birth weight., CONCLUSIONS: High first-trimester maternal serum resistin and low third-trimester IGFBP-1 were correlated with increased birth weight. We propose that low serum concentrations of IGFBP-1 represent a link between high BMI and increased fetal growth by increasing the bioavailability of insulin-like growth factor-I, which up-regulates placental nutrient transport.

AB  - Our aim was to study the feeding behavior of healthy term infants in the first week of life and determine whether this was related to cord blood leptin, ghrelin, and insulin. A total of 100 healthy bottle-fed infants were studied by weighing bottles of milk before and after feeds. Leptin, total ghrelin, and insulin concentrations were measured in cord blood. Mean (SD) birth weight was 3.46 (0.43) kg. Mean milk intake increased from 196.7 (83.0) g on d 1 to 585.0 (128.4) g on d 7. Milk intake over the first 6 d was significantly associated with weight gain to d 7. There was no relationship between cord ghrelin or leptin and milk intake or feed frequency. Cord blood insulin was inversely related to the mean daily number of feeds over the first 6 d (r = -0.21, p < 0.05). Birth weight and milk intake are the major determinants of weight gain in the first week of life in healthy bottle-fed infants. Total cord ghrelin and leptin are not directly related to milk intake or feed frequency in the first week of life. Circulating insulin concentrations may have a role in the initiation of feeding behavior.

AB  - Lower ghrelin levels have been related to slower growth in small for gestational age infants, and infants with higher cord leptin levels have been reported to gain weight more slowly from birth to 2 yr. This study investigated whether cord blood ghrelin and leptin levels are related to weight gain up to 12 wk of age. One hundred infants were weighed at birth and at 12 wk, and cord blood was assayed for ghrelin and leptin. The mean (+/-sd) birth weight was 3.458 (0.433) kg (median, 3.390; range, 2.510-4.615 kg). The mean (+/-sd) leptin level was 10.1 (6.7) ng/ml (median, 8.4; range, 1.6-36.7 ng/ml), and that of ghrelin was 760.9 (282.9) pg/ml (median, 770; range, 210-1670 pg/ml). Higher birth weight was associated with slower weight gain. Leptin was correlated with birth weight, but ghrelin was not, and leptin and ghrelin levels were not significantly correlated with one another. With birth weight as a control variable, ghrelin was significantly associated with slow weight gain (chi(2) = 7.20 with 1 df; P < 0.01), although leptin was not (chi(2) = 1.59 with 1 df; P > 0.1). In conclusion, lower cord ghrelin levels are associated with slower weight gain from birth to 3 months of age.

AB  - A public-health approach considers the relevance of nutritional research in the prevention and management of obesity. Well-defined and internationally-agreed definitions based on BMI allow an assessment of the worldwide prevalence of overweight and obesity. There are about 250 million obese adults in the world, and many more overweight. Obesity is emerging in the Third World, first in urban middle-aged women. With economic developments, obesity then occurs in men and younger women. In the West childhood obesity is rapidly emerging, with concern that early-onset obesity is especially hazardous. In Asians the risks of excess visceral fat occur at lower body weights than in Caucasians. The propensity to visceral obesity in Asians may relate to malnourished mothers and low birth weight. The International Obesity Task Force is considering many issues, including the health economics of obesity. It has developed a strategy to define childhood obesity, which in children over 6 years is likely to predict long-term weight and health problems. While the search for genetic markers of obesity continues, with particular interest in the leptin gene, it is clear that societal change, with the decline in physical activity and the passive overconsumption of high-fat diets are major contributors to the global increase in obesity. The public-health aspects of obesity research are therefore challenging.

AB  - During fetal life, placental tissue represents an additional source of leptin for the mother and conceptus. It has been suggested that feto-placental production of leptin may be involved in placental and fetal growth regulation. The aim of this study was to examine the correlation between leptin mRNA expression in the placenta and the concentrations of leptin in cord blood. A total of 30 healthy, pregnant women who gave birth to healthy neonates were included in the study. Maternal blood (obtained from the cubital vein) and umbilical cord blood were drawn immediately after birth. Serum leptin concentration was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and serum insulin concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay. Leptin mRNA was measured in placental tissue by a reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The estimated mean leptin mRNA expression in placenta was 4.65 +/- 1.83 pg mRNA/microg DNA. Leptin mRNA correlated with cord serum leptin concentrations (r = 0.3691, p = 0.045). Placental weight correlated with placental leptin mRNA (r = 0.3686, p = 0.045). The mean leptin concentration in cord serum at birth was slightly lower (3.1 +/- 1.9 ng/ml) than that found in maternal serum (3.9 +/- 1.2 ng/ml). A positive correlation was observed between cord and maternal serum leptin levels (r = 0.58, p = 0.001). The mean insulin concentration in maternal serum was not significantly higher than that in umbilical serum: 22.2 +/- 17.8 microIU/ml vs. 6.9 +/- 3.6 microIU/ml; r = 0.069, p = 0.71). Neither maternal nor umbilical insulin concentrations correlated with leptin concentration in cord or maternal peripheral serum.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptin is now known to be an important hormone affecting intrauterine fetal growth. Since growth of fetus is also affected by the glycemic status of the mother. Serum leptin of infant is influenced by the maternal diabetic state. Investigation of cord blood leptin in babies of DM (Diabetes Mellitus) and GDM (Gestational Diabetes Mellitus) mothers (controlled blood glucose levels) may provide some indication about involvement of genetic factor in the development of leptin abnormalities in fetus., AIM: The study was taken to investigate whether cord blood insulin, c-peptide and leptin levels correlate with birth weight in offspring of DM mother., METHODS: Blood was drawn from umbilical cord of 30 babies from GDM mothers (GDM-babies), 45 babies from Type 2 DM Mothers (DM-babies), and 30 babies from ND (Nondiabetic) mothers (ND-babies) of term pregnancy. Weight, blood glucose, placenta, serum leptin and c-peptide of the babies were measured., RESULTS: Birth weight of GDM and DM babies were significantly higher compared to ND-babies. Glucose level in GDM babies was significantly higher than ND and DM babies. Leptin levels in GDM babies were significantly higher than that of ND and DM babies. Serum c-peptide in GDM babies was significantly higher than DM and ND babies. However, there was no significant difference in leptin-glucose ratio among the three groups. Irrespective of degree of hyperglycemia leptin is a major determinant of fetal growth., CONCLUSIONS: DM mother produces different insulinemic and leptinemic responses in the fetus indicating a possible genetic involvement.

AB  - It has been reported that intrauterine undernutrition is closely associated with the pathogeneses of certain diseases in adulthood; i.e., insulin resistance and diabetes, and that leptin resistance plays a pivotal role in the pathology of such intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)-related conditions. Therefore, examinations of IUGR-induced leptin resistance in early developmental period are important for protecting against future disease. In this study, the effects of prenatal undernutrition on the serum leptin levels and central leptin responses of rats during the neonatal and/or pre-pubertal period were examined. The 50% food-restricted undernourished dams' offspring (UNO) exhibited a significantly lower birth weight than the normal nutrition dams' offspring (NNO). However, the UNO grew rapidly, and their mean body weight had caught up with that of the NNO by postnatal day 8. Thus, there were no significant differences between the body weights of the two groups at postnatal day 12, 16, 20, or 28. The serum leptin levels of the UNO were significantly higher than those of the NNO at postnatal days 20 and 28. At postnatal day 28, no significant difference in the hypothalamic mRNA level of neuropeptide Y, which is the main target of leptin, or that of ObRb, which is the leptin receptor, was detected between the NNO and UNO. The chronic intracerebroventricular injection of leptin attenuated body weight gain in both the NNO and UNO; however, there were no significant differences between the body weights of the two groups at any of the examined postnatal time points, indicating that the UNO and NNO exhibited similar central sensitivity to leptin during the pre-pubertal period. These results suggest that prenatal undernutrition induces leptin resistance until the neonatal to pre-pubertal period and that these alterations might be caused by impaired transportation of leptin to central tissues.

AB  - The placenta is a major source of leptin in the fetomaternal circulation, although its physiological role remains to be clarified. Leptin in the fetomaternal circulation is proposed to be a marker of acute stress in the fetus, and the fetus suffering from pre-eclampsia would be under chronic stress. In 16 pre-eclamptic placentas, the expressions of leptin, hypoxia-inducible factor 1alpha (HIF1alpha) and leptin receptor mRNAs were analyzed by semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and compared with clinical data. The co-expressions of leptin and the isoforms of the leptin receptor were observed in all the pre-eclamptic placentas. Leptin mRNA was significantly augmented in the pre-eclamptic placentas, although the level in fetal plasma was not high. The level of the expression of leptin mRNA was correlated with the placental HIF1alpha mRNA level and fetal body weight, but not with the levels of the leptin receptor isoforms in the pre-eclamptic placentas. This observation may suggest that autocrine/paracrine regulation of leptin exists in the human placenta and is upregulated in the pre-eclamptic placenta.

AB  - Preterm infants are at high risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia and pulmonary hypertension from inflammatory lung injury. In adult models, adiponectin (APN)-an adipocyte-derived hormone-protects the lung from inflammatory injury and pulmonary vascular remodeling. Cord blood APN levels in premature infants born < 26 weeks gestation are 5% of the level in infants born at term. We previously reported the expression profile of APN and its receptors in neonatal rat lung homogenates during the first 3 weeks of postnatal development. Here, we characterize the expression profile of APN and its receptors in specific lung cells and the effects of exogenous recombinant APN (rAPN) on lipopolysaccharide-(LPS)-induced cytokine and chemokine production in total lung homogenates and specific lung cells. In vitro, rAPN added to primary cultures of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells attenuated the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. In vivo, intraperitoneal rAPN (2 mg/kg), given 4 hr prior to intrapharyngeal administration of LPS (5 mg/kg) to newborn rats at postnatal day 4, significantly reduced gene and protein expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1ss and reduced protein expression of the chemokines monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP-1) and macrophage inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha) in the lung. LPS-induced histopathological changes in the lung were also decreased. Moreover, rAPN given 20 hr after intrapharyngeal LPS had a similar effect on lung inflammation. These findings suggest a role for APN in protecting the lung from inflammation during early stages of lung development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE-To characterize the hormonal milieu and adipose gene expression in response to catch-up growth (CUG), a growth pattern associated with obesity and diabetes risk, in a mouse model of low birth weight (LBW). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS-ICR mice were food restricted by 50% from gestational days 12.5-18.5, reducing offspring birth weight by 25%. During the suckling period, dams were either fed ad libitum, permitting CUG in offspring, or food restricted, preventing CUG. Offspring were killed at age 3 weeks, and gonadal fat was removed for RNA extraction, array analysis, RT-PCR, and evaluation of cell size and number. Serum insulin, thyroxine (T4), corticosterone, and adipokines were measured. RESULTS-At age 3 weeks, LBW mice with CUG (designated U-C) had body weight comparable with controls (designated C-C) weight was reduced by 49% in LBW mice without CUG (designated U-U). Adiposity was altered by postnatal nutrition, with gonadal fat increased by 50% in U-C and decreased by 58% in U-U mice (P < 0.05 vs. C-C mice). Adipose expression of the lipogenic genes Fasn, AccI, Lpin1, and Srebf1 was significantly increased in U-C compared with both C-C and U-U mice (P < 0.05). Mitochondrial DNA copy number was reduced by > 50% in U-C versus U-U mice (P = 0.014). Although cell numbers did not differ, mean adipocyte diameter was increased in U-C and reduced in U-U mice (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS-CUG results in increased adipose tissue lipogenic gene expression and adipocyte diameter but not increased cellularity, suggesting that catch-up fat is primarily associated with lipogenesis rather than adipogenesis in this murine model.

AB  - Obesity in both women and men is regarded as one of the many factors that may contribute to impaired reproductive health. Obesity can be accompanied by several neuroendocrine and ovarian dysfunctions, including chronic oligo/anovulation, menstrual irregularities, subfertility, and the increased risk of pregnancy in women. Insulin resistance, elevated triglyceride and fatty acid levels, and the secretion of adipocytokines caused by the excessive accumulation of adipose tissue associated with obesity adversely affect reproductive functions. Alterations in sperm quality and motility and hormone levels related to a rise in body mass index (BMI) may predispose men to infertility. The mechanisms of action of obesity on male infertility include endocrinopathy, erectile dysfunction, epididymitis, increased leptin and adipocytes, increased aromatase, inflammatory cytokines secreted by fat tissue, and sperm DNA fragmentation. This study reports that an increased BMI may lead to low semen quality, poor sperm motility, and reduced fertilization rates in men as well as anovulation, pregnancy loss, diminished pregnancy, and low live birth rates in women. Having optimal weight with balanced nutrition enables one to maintain a continuity of reproductive health throughout the entire life cycle, which is extremely important in terms of having a healthy embryo, including pre-foetal life, in the continuity of pregnancy and having a live birth.

AB  - Adipocytokines, which are secreted during fetal development by both mothers and fetuses, may influence fetal lung development, but little human data are available. We used data from the HOME Study to investigate the associations of cord blood adipocytokine concentrations with children's lung forced expiratory volume (FEV1; N = 160) and their risk of wheeze (N = 281). We measured umbilical cord serum adipocytokine concentrations using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and FEV1 using a portable spirometer at ages 4 and 5 to calculate the percent predicted FEV1 (%FEV1). Parents completed standardized questionnaires of their child's wheeze symptoms every 6 months from birth to age 5, then again at ages 6 and 8. We used multivariable linear mixed models and modified Poisson regression with generalized estimating equations to estimate associations of adipocytokine concentrations (log2-transformed) with children's %FEV1 and the risk of wheeze, respectively, adjusting for sociodemographic, perinatal, and child factors. Cord serum leptin was not associated with children's %FEV1. Higher cord serum adiponectin concentrations were associated with higher %FEV1 in girls (beta = 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.6, 5.6), but not in boys (beta = -1.3, 95% CI: -5.9, 3.3) (sex x adiponectin p-value = 0.05). Higher leptin was associated with lower risk of wheeze in girls (RR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.66, 0.84), but not boys (RR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.69, 1.11) (sex x leptin p-value = 0.01). In contrast, higher adiponectin concentrations were associated with lower risk of wheeze (RR = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.96) in both boys and girls. These data suggest that fetal adipocytokines may impact lung development and function in early childhood. Future studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the mechanisms underlying these associations.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with metabolic risk have never been extensively investigated in SGA subjects. The aim of the current study was to evaluate miRNAs in SGA and AGA subjects and their relationships with the metabolic status and growth., DESIGN AND METHODS: A prospective longitudinal case-control study was performed in 23 SGA with postnatal catch-up growth and 27 AGA subjects evaluated at the age of 9 and 21 years. Circulating levels of miR-122-5p, miR-16-5p, miR-126-3p, and miR-486-5p were assessed by qPCR., RESULTS: SGA subjects were shorter both at 9 and at 21 years. No significant differences in insulin like growth factors and metabolic profile were found with the exception of basal glycemia at 9 years. miRNA levels did not differ between SGA and AGA subjects, at 9 and 21 years. miR-16-5p and miR-126-3p levels were higher at 9 than at 21 years. In SGA subjects, miR-122-5p at 9 years was inversely related to adiponectin levels at 21 years and miR-486-5p at 9 years was inversely related to whole-body insulin sensitivity at 9 years and directly related to Hb1Ac at 21 years. Regression analyses showed no predictive value of miRNAs for growth parameters in neither SGA nor AGA subjects., CONCLUSIONS: SGA with postnatal catch-up growth did not show any difference in metabolic risk markers or miRNA circulating levels compared to AGA controls in childhood and young adulthood. miR-122-5p during childhood could identify SGA subjects at higher risk of developing insulin resistance and, eventually, type 2 diabetes in adulthood but further studies are needed to confirm it.

AB  - AIM: Recent progress in adiposcience has revealed several important adipose-tissue-originated factors, so-called adipokines. Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4), a protein expressed and secreted by adipocytes, has been identified as a novel regulator of insulin resistance. Physiological insulin resistance occurs during the pregnancy of mammals to accommodate fetal growth, and it has been suggested that insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia might also be associated with pregnancy-induced hypertension (PIH). In order to shed light on the role of RBP4 during pregnancy, we attempted to assess RBP4 levels during pregnancy. Fetal growth could be affected by aberrant regulation of RBP4 levels in fetal circulation per se, so we examined the RBP4 levels in cord blood samples of growth restricted cases., METHODS: Circulating RBP4 levels were examined in non-pregnant and pregnant healthy women using Western blotting. Also, RBP4 levels in normal pregnancy and PIH were quantitated using Dot-blot analysis. RBP4 levels in cord blood samples also were evaluated in selected cases., RESULTS: RBP4 levels tended to decrease after early gestation with no obvious difference between mid- to late-gestation. RBP4 levels were increased in pregnant women with PIH compared with normal pregnancies (P < 0.01). RBP4 levels were decreased in the cord blood of PIH pregnancies and light-for-dates infants without obvious causes for intrauterine growth restriction compared with normal pregnancies (P < 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that circulating RBP4 could be elevated in PIH, where maternal glucose metabolism is perturbed, and that RBP4 levels in cord blood might be closely associated with fetal growth.

AB  - AIMS: High-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMW-ad) is an active form of adiponectin. No information is available with respect to HMW-ad in neonates. The aims of this study were to examine whether HMW-ad is present in cord blood, to define the association between the concentrations of cord blood HMW-ad and leptin, and their correlation with anthropometric measurements of term neonates at birth., METHODS: Venous cord blood samples were obtained from 135 term healthy neonates (birth weight 2,261-4,164 g) born at Showa University Hospital. Total adiponectin (T-ad), HMW-ad and leptin levels were measured by ELISA., RESULTS: HMW-ad levels were 14.9 +/- 5.8 microg/ml and the ratio of HMW-ad to T-ad was 0.49 +/- 0.15. In a multiple regression analysis, cord blood HMW-ad levels were a significant predictor of birth weight and birth length, and leptin level was a significant predictor of birth weight and birth weight to body length ratio. There was a significant relationship between concentrations of HMW-ad and leptin controlling for sex, gestational age and birth weight., CONCLUSION: These results show that HMW-ad exists as a half of T-ad in the cord blood. Leptin and HMW-ad may regulate synergistically fetal growth. Copyright 2008 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is limited information regarding the effects of IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3 on circulating leptin concentrations., AIM: To determine the effects of IGF-I on leptin and insulin concentrations, we examined leptin and insulin nocturnal profiles before and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex (Iplex) to prepubertal, low birth weight children., METHODS: We studied 20 prepubertal children (11 boys and 9 girls), born after a full-term pregnancy with a mean birth weight below 2.8 kg. They were studied at the mean age of 7.3 +/- 0.5 years (range 4-11 years). Their mean height was -1.8 +/- 0.3 SDS and their mean BMI was 0.1 +/- 0.2 SDS at the time of the study. The children were studied on 2 separate occasions, the first under basal conditions, and the second time after s.c. administration of 1 mg/kg of Iplex at 21.00 h. Blood samples for determination of leptin and insulin were obtained every 60 min between 23.00 h and 07.00 h, while the children were sleeping. In each patient, we calculated the leptin and insulin mean area under the curve, both under basal conditions and after the administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex., RESULTS: Mean nocturnal leptin area under the curve exhibited a significant increase (2.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 11.2 +/- 2.6 ng/ml h, p < 0.05), whereas that for mean insulin showed a slight decrease, which did not reach statistical significance after administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex., CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that administration of the IGF-I/IGFBP-3 complex increases circulating leptin concentrations in short prepubertal, small for gestational age children, suggesting that IGF-I and/or IGFBP-3 may stimulate leptin secretion by adipose tissue.

AB  - Adiponectin, a novel adipocytokine with insulin sensitizing properties, is inversely related to obesity and insulin resistance in adults. We recently reported large variations in weight gain and insulin sensitivity during the first year in infants born small for gestational age (SGA) or appropriate for gestational age (AGA). We now determined whether adiponectin levels were related to postnatal growth and insulin sensitivity in a prospective cohort followed from birth to two years old (n = 85) (55 female/30 male, 65 SGA/20 AGA). Serum adiponectin levels at one year and two years were higher compared to reported levels in adults and older children, and decreased from one year (21.6 +/- 0.6 microg/ml) to two years (15.7 +/- 0.7 microg/ml) (p < 0.05). At two years adiponectin levels were lower in females (15.3 +/- 0.4 microg/ml) than males (16.4 +/- 0.6 microg/ml) (p < 0.05), but no gender difference was seen in leptin or insulin levels. No differences in adiponectin levels were seen between SGA and AGA infants at one or two years. However, in SGA infants changes in adiponectin between one to two years old were inversely related to weight gain (r = -0.310, p < 0.05). Changes in leptin levels between one to two years were positively related to weight gain in both SGA and AGA infants (r = 0.450 and r = 0.500 respectively, both p < 0.05). Adiponectin levels were unrelated to insulin levels at one or two years, nor to change in insulin levels between one to two years. In multiple regression analysis, adiponectin levels were related only to postnatal age; omitting age from the model, the determinants of higher adiponectin levels were male gender (p = 0.03), lower postnatal body weight (p < 0.001), and higher birth weight SD score (p = 0.004). In conclusion, fall in serum adiponectin levels during the first two years of life were related to increasing age and greater weight gain SGA infants, but were unrelated to insulin sensitivity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: While postnatal growth in the first month of life is known to impact retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) risk, the impact of growth later in hospitalization, during critical times of retinal vascularization, remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to assess if postnatal growth and body composition during the second half of neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization were associated with severity of retinopathy of prematurity in very low birth weight preterm infants., METHODS: Prospective observational pilot study of 83 infants born <32 weeks gestation and <1500 g, conducted at a Level IV neonatal intensive care unit. Body composition was measured during the second half of hospitalization. Infants were evaluated for retinopathy of prematurity. Logistic regression was performed., RESULTS: Greater gains in fat mass, fat-free mass, and percent body fat from 32 to 37 weeks postmenstrual age and higher % body fat at term postmenstrual age were associated with decreased odds of >=stage 2 retinopathy of prematurity (p < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Improved growth later in neonatal intensive care unit hospitalization and increased adiposity at term may reduce odds of severe retinopathy of prematurity.

AB  - In term neonates, the adiponectin concentration is higher than it is in adults. To determine the relationship between adiponectin and early neonatal growth in a cohort study. Fifty-two neonates at term were studied. Serum adiponectin concentrations, body sizes, and skinfold thicknesses were measured at birth and at 1 mo of age. At birth, cord blood adiponectin concentration correlated positively with birth weight (r = 0.484, p = 0.0003), birth length (r = 0.524, p < 0.0001), and sum of the four skinfold thickness measurements (r = 0.378, p = 0.0057). In a stepwise regression, birth length was the only determinant of cord blood adiponectin concentration. However, at 1 mo of age, serum adiponectin concentration correlated with no anthropometric parameter at all. Between birth and 1 mo of age, the individual change in adiponectin concentration correlated negatively with birth weight. Thus, serum adiponectin concentrations in cord blood have a strong relationship to birth length rather than to body fatness, and this relationship is not demonstrated in 1-mo-old infants. These results imply that hormonal, substrate, or other mechanisms that regulate the relationship between body composition and growth in fetal life are different from those governing these relationships in early postnatal life.

AB  - Aim: Maternal obesity and improper nutrition predispose offspring to chronic metabolic diseases. Although the frequency of these diseases increases with aging, the effect of a maternal high-fat diet on aged offspring remains elusive. Main methods: C57BL/6J female mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet or a control (CON) diet and then mated. All offspring remained with their birth dam until weaning at 3 weeks. After weaning, the offspring from the HF and CON diet-fed dams were given either the HF diet or CON diet, which resulted in four groups: CON/CON, CON/HF, HF/CON, and HF/HF. All mice were immunized with ovalbumin and then sacrificed at 70 weeks. Key findings: The body weights in offspring from dam exposed to a HF diet were significantly higher than those in offspring from dam fed a CON diet in the early stage of life but then became lower in the later stage of life. The serum adiponectin levels were lower in offspring from dam exposed to a HF diet and were correlated with adiposity measured by visceral and subcutaneous fat mass. Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was much more severe in the livers of offspring from the maternal HF groups. In particular, lobular inflammation and fibrosis were prominent in the HF/HF group. Regarding immunological parameters, senescence-associated T cells were increased, and natural killer T cells were decreased by the effect of both maternal and offspring HF diet. Significance: We have demonstrated that a maternal high-fat diet may accelerate the adipo-immunologic aging process.

AB  - We describe a patient characterized by reduced fetal growth, no history of rapid "catch-up" growth in prepubertal childhood, and adolescent onset diabetes. High doses of insulin were required for glycemic control. Pioglitazone treatment was followed by a deterioration of glycemic control and hepatic steatosis, while metformin treatment was followed by a partial response. Leptin and adiponectin levels were reduced, but a significant increase in leptin and adiponectin levels occurred concomitantly with an increase in weight and adiposity. This case suggests that some fetal genetic factors determining insulin sensitivity might be linked to a reduction in fetal growth as well as the later development of diabetes.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is still associated with increased risk for severe maternal and fetal complications but their pathomechanism remains unclear. We investigated into possible role of placental leptin (LEP) and its receptor gene (LEPR) in T1DM pregnancies. Fourty nine pregnant women with T1DM and singleton pregnancy were enrolled into the study. Control group consisted of 15 healthy pregnant women in uncomplicated, singleton gestation. We observed higher expression of LEP and LEPR in T1DM placentas in comparison to healthy subjects. We also noticed greater expression of LEP and LEPR in T1DM pregnancies with large for gestational age (LGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) fetuses in comparison to small for gestational age (SGA) diabetic fetuses and controls. We found a significant positive correlation between placental LEP and LEPR expression and neonatal birthweight in overweight T1DM subjects. No such a correlation was found in T1DM subjects with normal weight and controls. We conclude that increased placental LEP and LEPR expression may have a role in stimulating fetal overgrowth in T1DM pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study across childhood the features of small for gestational age (SGA) girls with spontaneous catch-up growth., DESIGN: Longitudinal study (age 2-8 years)., SETTING: University hospital., PATIENT(S): Post-catch-up SGA girls (n = 18) versus healthy control girls born appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 13)., INTERVENTION(S): None., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Height, weight, fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-I, high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, LDL and HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, body composition by absorptiometry (2-8 years); visceral fat by magnetic resonance imaging (6-8 years); bone age (by automated reading), sex hormone-binding globulin, DHEAS, and leptin (8 years)., RESULT(S): At age 2 years, AGA and SGA girls were comparable for all study markers. Between 2 and 8 years, girls were prepubertal; AGA and SGA girls gained height, lean mass, and bone mineral content similarly; other outcomes diverged so that, at age 8, SGA girls had markedly higher levels of circulating insulin, IGF-I, DHEAS, LDL cholesterol, and leptin; lower HMW adiponectin and SHBG levels; more total and visceral fat (without being obese); and an older bone age., CONCLUSION(S): After completing catch-up growth and before starting puberty, SGA girls develop an ensemble that includes not only central adiposity, hyperinsulinemia, and hypoadiponectinemia but also hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, lower SHBG and higher DHEAS levels, and faster bone maturation.

AB  - In girls, low birth weight (LBW), when followed by postnatal catch-up growth, is accompanied by endocrine-metabolic abnormalities which include a more adipose body composition (with increased visceral fat), insulin resistance and a less favorable adipokine profile as early as in the pre-school age. These girls also exhibit follicle-stimulating hormone hypersecretion both in early infancy and early post-menarche, with reduced uterine and ovarian size in adolescence. These endocrine and gynecological changes result in a decreased ovulation rate and in an advanced tempo of adrenarche, pubertal development and menarche (by nearly a year, compared to non-LBW girls). The earlier maturation in LBW girls may result in a loss of about 1 SD in height, as compared with target height. During the post-menarcheal period, LBW girls are at increased risk of developing polycystic ovary syndrome. Early insulin sensitization may prevent or delay some of the endocrine-metabolic abnormalities associated to LBW. Copyright © 2011 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Puberty is part of a critical window in which adiposity and its correlates can be fine-tuned toward reproduction, which implies that puberty provides an opportunity to reprogram a misprogramming that occurred in early life. We tested this hypothesis in low-birthweight (LBW) girls with precocious pubarche (PP), who are at risk for hyperinsulinemic body adiposity during and beyond puberty., STUDY DESIGN: LBW girls with PP (n = 38; mean age 8 years) were randomized to remain untreated or to receive metformin across puberty (425 mg/d for 2 years, then 850 mg/d for 2 years); subsequently, all girls were monitored for 1 year without intervention. Here we report on the latter year., RESULTS: The benefits of metformin were mostly maintained during the posttreatment year so that, after 5 years, metformin therapy was associated with more lean mass; with less total, visceral, and hepatic fat; with lower circulating levels of androgens and leptin; and with elevated levels of high-molecular-weight adiponectin and undercarboxylated osteocalcin., CONCLUSION: In LBW girls with PP, pubertal metformin therapy was followed by a favorable adipokine profile and by a reduction of total, visceral, and hepatic adiposity beyond puberty.

AB  - Breast-fed infants born small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (n = 28) were found to develop lower adiposity across early infancy, when compared with appropriate-for-gestational age infants (n = 46). The SGA infants were also found to have 2-fold higher (P < .001) levels of circulating leptin at 4 months. This paradoxical hyperleptinemia in early infancy may contribute to a program that produces a process from fetal underweight to adult overweight.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: A high sensitivity to insulin and a low amount of sc fat are among the hallmarks of short children born small for gestational age (SGA). We studied the effects of GH therapy on fat partitioning (including in the abdominal region) and circulating levels of triacylglycerol and newly identified adipokines, such as follistatin and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin in short SGA children., SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital., PATIENTS: Patients included 35 short SGA children (mean age 7 yr, height -3.1 sd)., DESIGN: All children received GH but they were randomized for an early start (GH for 4 months) vs. a delayed start (untreated for 4 months, then GH for 4 months). Mean GH dose after 4 months was 36 microg/kg x d., MAIN OUTCOMES: Outcomes included fasting serum glucose, insulin, triacylglycerol, HMW adiponectin, follistatin; body size and composition; and abdominal fat partitioning., RESULTS: GH therapy was accompanied by robust changes toward the norm (height, weight, lean mass, follistatin) but also by changes away from the norm (low HMW adiponectin, high triacylglycerol). Some baseline anomalies were amplified (more deficit of sc fat, both at total body level and in the abdominal region), whereas other baseline anomalies were overcorrected (from a highly insulin sensitive state to an insulin resistant state)., CONCLUSION: GH therapy in short SGA children is accompanied by not only a more normal body size and follistatinemia but also insulin resistance, hypo-HMW-adiponectinemia, hypertriacylglycerolemia, and an amplification of the deficit in sc fat.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) tend to become hyperinsulinemic and viscerally adipose and to have low levels of circulating high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin upon completion of catch-up growth. We studied whether the same applies to SGA children, who failed to develop spontaneous catch-up growth., SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital., PATIENTS: Patients included 24 short SGA children (11 girls, 13 boys; mean age 7.5 yr, height -3.0 SD) as compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) children (n = 32) and catch-up SGA children (n = 32) of similar height, weight, and body mass index., MAIN OUTCOMES: We measured fasting serum glucose, insulin, IGF-I, and HMW adiponectin; body composition by absorptiometry; and abdominal fat partitioning by magnetic resonance imaging., RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Short SGA children were highly sensitive to insulin (P < 0.001 vs. AGA; P < 0.0001 vs. catch-up SGA), had low IGF-I levels, and had high-normal levels of HMW adiponectin (mean 14.0 vs. 7.4 mg/liter in catch-up SGA; P < 0.001). In the abdominal region, short SGA children had a normal amount of visceral fat (mean 17 vs. 18 cm(2) in AGA), but their sc fat was strikingly reduced (mean 18 vs. 29 cm(2) in AGA; P < 0.0001); this combination resulted in a markedly elevated ratio of visceral over sc fat (P < 0.0001 vs. AGA). The effects of GH therapy on these features of short SGA children remain to be studied.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most children born small for gestational age (SGA) normalize their body size by late infancy. Between 2 and 6 yr, such SGA children develop higher circulating levels of insulin, lower levels of adiponectin, and more visceral fat than appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) controls, even in the absence of overweight. Here we report on their further course between 6 and 8 yr. STUDY DESIGN AND POPULATION: Longitudinal study over 2 yr comparing data from 32 AGA vs. 32 SGA children, matched for gender, height, weight, and body mass index at the age of 6 yr., MAIN OUTCOMES: Fasting insulin, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), SHBG, high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, leptin, IGF-I; body composition by absorptiometry; and abdominal fat partitioning by magnetic resonance imaging., RESULTS: Between 6 and 8 yr, novel AGA-vs.-SGA divergences emerged (higher DHEAS and lower SHBG in SGA; P < 0.001), and some earlier divergences widened further (HMW adiponectin, visceral fat; P < 0.001), whereas others stabilized (fasting insulin, IGF-I). At age 8 yr, the most discerning features of SGA children were a high ratio of visceral over sc fat in the abdominal region (69% of SGA children), HMW hypoadiponectinemia (41%), fasting hyperinsulinemia (34%), and elevated circulating IGF-I levels (31%)., CONCLUSION: SGA children with spontaneous catch-up growth develop relatively high DHEAS and low SHBG levels and become more often HMW hypoadiponectinemic and viscerally adipose between 6 and 8 yr of age.

AB  - CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: A low birth weight (LBW) tends to be followed by overweight due to an excess of fat, including visceral fat. LBW girls with precocious pubarche (PP) (pubic hair < 8 yr) are at high risk for developing an adipose state of hyperinsulinemic androgen excess that leads toward early menarche. We explored the effects of insulin sensitization with metformin in LBW-PP girls. SETTING , DESIGN, PATIENTS, INTERVENTION: Prepubertal LBW girls with PP (mean body weight 2.4 kg; age 7.9 yr; body mass index 18.4 kg/m(2)) were studied. Girls were randomly assigned to remain untreated (n=19) or receive metformin for 4 yr (n = 19; 425 mg/d for 2 yr, then 850 mg/d for 2 yr)., MAIN OUTCOMES: At the start and after 4 yr, height, weight, fasting insulin, glucose, IGF-I, testosterone, lipids, leptin, high molecular weight adiponectin, body composition by absorptiometry, abdominal fat partitioning (only 4 yr) by magnetic resonance imaging, and menarcheal status were determined., RESULTS: Metformin-treated girls gained on average 5.5 kg (or approximately 50%) less fat, after 4 yr were less insulin resistant and less hyperandrogenic, had lower IGF-I levels and a less atherogenic lipid profile, and were less likely to be post-menarcheal than untreated girls, whereas their gain in height, lean mass, and bone mineral density were similar. After 4 yr, untreated girls had more visceral fat, a higher ratio of visceral-to-sc fat, and a higher leptin-to-high molecular weight adiponectin ratio (all approximately 50% higher) than metformin-treated girls., CONCLUSION: Long-term metformin treatment appears to reduce total and visceral fat in LBW-PP girls, and to delay menarche without attenuating linear growth, thereby opening the perspective that adult height may be increased.

AB  - CONTEXT: Children born small for gestational age (SGA) tend to develop catch-up growth in infancy and become overweight by the age of 6 yr. Weight control is advocated as a preventive measure, but it is unknown whether such control suffices to prevent visceral fat excess and hypoadiponectinemia., SETTING: The study was performed at a university hospital., STUDY POPULATION AND DESIGN: A total of 64 children (32 matched pairs) aged 6 yr, of whom 32 were born appropriate for gestational age and 32 were born SGA, and had subsequently developed spontaneous catch-up growth were included in the study; matching was performed for gender, height, weight, and, thus, body mass index., MAIN OUTCOMES: Fasting insulin, IGF-I, high molecular weight adiponectin, leptin, visfatin, and lean and fat mass were calculated by absorptiometry, and abdominally sc and visceral fat by magnetic resonance imaging., RESULTS: After strict matching, SGA children had a total lean mass, total fat mass, leptinemia, and visfatinemia comparable to those in the appropriate for gestational age children, but they still had higher fasting insulin and IGF-I levels (P < 0.01), much lower high molecular weight adiponectin levels (P < 0.0001), and a striking shift from abdominally sc to visceral fat (P < 0.0001). Fasting insulin (r = 0.52; P < 0.00001) was a major determinant of visceral fat in boys and girls, explaining 28% of its variance., CONCLUSIONS: SGA children tend to be viscerally adipose and hypo-adiponectinemic, even if they are not overweight. Therefore, measures beyond weight control seem to be needed to allow most SGA children to normalize their body composition and endocrine-metabolic homeostasis.

AB  - CONTEXT: Fetal development is thought to be gender specific for adiposity and circulating insulin and IGF-I but not adipokinemia, as judged by serum visfatin and adiponectin at term birth. We studied the potential relationship between these gender specificities and fetal growth., SETTING: The study was conducted at a university hospital., STUDY POPULATION: Subjects included 96 strictly matched neonates born appropriate for gestational age (AGA; 24 girls, 24 boys) or small for gestational age (SGA; 24 girls, 24 boys)., MAIN OUTCOMES: Outcomes included serum insulin, IGF-I, visfatin, total and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, osteocalcin at term birth, and neonatal body composition by absorptiometry., RESULTS: Cord insulin and IGF-I levels were higher in girls than boys (P < or = 0.01), in both the AGA and SGA subpopulation. In AGA newborns, fat and lean mass were each gender specific (P < 0.0001), whereas visfatin and total and HMW adiponectin were not. Conversely, in SGA newborns, visfatin and HMW adiponectin were gender specific (higher levels in girls), whereas body adiposity was not. In SGA fetuses, the distribution of adiponectin isoforms was in both genders shifted toward HMW (P < 0.005 vs. AGA). Cord osteocalcin did not differ by either gender or birth weight., CONCLUSION: At term birth, the gender specificity of adiposity and circulating visfatin and HMW adiponectin appeared to depend on prenatal growth, whereas the gender specificity of insulin and IGF-I levels did not. The fetal shift in adiponectin isoforms may contribute to explain why SGA newborns tend to be hypersensitive to insulin.

AB  - A minority of children born small for gestational age (SGA) maintain a slow weight gain and a short stature (SS). At the other end of the spectrum are SGA children who show rapid postnatal weight gain and catch-up growth; these subjects may develop hyperinsulinemia, exaggerated adrenarche with precocious pubarche (PP), and an associated proinflammatory state with raised IL-6 and reduced adiponectin levels. Metformin therapy in SGA-PP girls attenuates the hyperinsulinemia, the adrenal androgen excess, and the proinflammatory state. In contrast, GH therapy in SGA-SS children promotes height gain but may induce hyperinsulinemia. Both groups are associated with increased risk markers for future cardiovascular disease. Therefore, we studied markers of inflammation in both SGA subpopulations at baseline and after their respectively corrective therapies. SGA-PP girls (n = 33; mean age, 8 yr; body mass index, 18.5 kg/m(2)) were randomized to remain untreated or to receive metformin (425 mg/d) for 6 months. SGA-SS children (n = 29; mean age, 7 yr; body mass index, 14.7 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to remain untreated or to receive GH (60 mug/kg/d). In SGA-PP girls, the mean neutrophil count (4.0 x 1000/mm(3)) was more than 2 sd above the mean reference level (2.8 x 1000/mm(3), P < 0.001); this remained stable over 6 months in untreated girls but dropped in metformin-treated girls by -1.1 x 1000/mm(3) (P = 0.002). In SGA-SS children, neutrophil counts were also higher at baseline (3.3 x 1000/mm(3), P < 0.01). This remained stable in untreated children but rose in GH-treated children by +1.1 x 1000/mm(3) (P = 0.004). GH-treated children also showed a rise in circulating IL-6 and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate levels and a fall in adiponectin levels. In conclusion, neutrophil counts were elevated in SGA children. In SGA girls with PP, the present results corroborate the antiinflammatory benefits of metformin therapy. In contrast, high-dose GH therapy in short SGA children may increase neutrophil counts and lead to a less favorable adipocytokine profile. Future studies with combined GH plus metformin treatment in short SGA children may clarify whether insulin resistance is a mechanism linking GH therapy to markers of inflammation.

AB  - Among girls with precocious pubarche (PP), those with low birth weight (LBW) are, even if nonobese, at risk for progression to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) including hyperinsulinemic hyperandrogenism, dyslipidemia, dysadipocytokinemia, and central fat excess. Recently, we disclosed the efficacy of insulin sensitization with metformin to disrupt progression from PP to PCOS in formerly LBW girls who were postmenarche. In LBW-PP girls, we have now extended the exploration of early insulin sensitization therapy in two directions: 1) metformin therapy was started before puberty; and 2) we assessed the effects of metformin discontinuation in girls who had started metformin treatment after menarche. Prepubertal LBW-PP girls (n = 33; mean age, 8.0 yr; body mass index, 18.5 kg/m(2)) were randomly assigned to remain untreated or to receive metformin (425 mg/d) for 6 months. Postpubertal LBW-PP girls (n = 24; age, 12.4 yr; body mass index, 21.0 kg/m(2)) had been randomized (at -12 months) to remain untreated or to receive metformin (850 mg/d) for 12 months, at which time (0 month) a treatment cross-over was performed for 6 months. Fasting blood glucose and serum insulin, SHBG, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, androstenedione, testosterone, lipid profile, IL-6, and adiponectin were assessed at 0 and 6 months, as was body composition (by dual x-ray absorptiometry). In the prepubertal study (group A), comparisons of untreated vs. treated girls disclosed normalizing effects of metformin on SHBG, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, low and high density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, IL-6, adiponectin, total and abdominal fat mass, and lean body mass. In the postpubertal study (group B), treatment cross-over at 0 month was in each subgroup followed by a striking reversal in the course of the endocrine-metabolic state, adipocytokinemia, and body composition; all changes pointed to normalizing effects of metformin treatment. In conclusion, these two studies provide the first evidence that 1) prepubertal metformin therapy has normalizing effects on PCOS features in high risk girls with a combined history of LBW and PP; and 2) in adolescence, metformin's normalizing effects are reversed as soon as metformin therapy is discontinued.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hyperinsulinism and hyperandrogenism have the capacity to increase bone mineral density (BMD) and serum leptin, independently of body fat mass. We therefore assessed lumbar BMD and serum leptin in girls with the sequence of a low birthweight and precocious pubarche (PP) in childhood, in whom hyperinsulinism and hyperandrogenism have been described., METHODS: Fifty-two non-obese PP girls were studied (age range 6.9-14.9 years). Serum leptin was also measured in 42 control girls, matched for age, body mass index and pubertal stage., RESULTS: BMD SDS, measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, was elevated in PP girls compared to the population reference (0.39 +/- 0.18 SDS; p = 0.03) and bone age, assessed from hand radiographs, was significantly advanced compared to chronological age (1.2 +/- 0.1 years; p < 0.0005)., CONCLUSION: Compared to control girls, PP girls had higher leptin levels for degree of body mass index (PP girls: 9.4 +/- 0.6 ng/ml; controls: 7.8 +/- 0.6 ng/ml; p = 0.01). In PP girls, serum leptin was inversely related to birthweight (r = -0.32, p = 0.01) and positively related to free androgen index (FAI) (r = 0.71, p < 0.0005). BMD SDS was also inversely related to birthweight (r = -0.26, p < 0.05) and positively related to serum leptin (r = 0.42, p < 0.05), FAI (r = 0.45, p < 0.05) and mean serum insulin during oral glucose tolerance testing (MSI) (r = 0.59, p < 0.0005). In multiple regression, MSI was the strongest determinant of BMD SDS (beta = 0.50, p = 0.002). In conclusion, elevated BMD and serum leptin in non-obese PP girls were related to degrees of low birthweight, hyperinsulinism and hyperandrogenism. The characteristic hyperinsulinism of PP girls is proposed to be the key variable in this constellation. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - BACKGROUND: Overweight/obese (OW/OB) women are at high risk to develop gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) in pregnancy. AIM: To investigate, in pregnant OW/OB women, the longitudinal changes of adiponectin plasma levels, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and to identify if there is any association between adipokines and subsequent development of GDM. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty-two OW/OB normotensive normoglycaemic women at the beginning of pregnancy were studied. Adiponectin, insulin sensitivity (homeostasis model assessment, HOMA) and lipid panel were measured at 1st, 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy. The bioelectrical impedance to estimate the subject's body composition was also performed. RESULTS: Sixteen OW/OB women developed GDM. There were no significant differences with regard to age, BMI and body composition. Glycaemic and insulinaemic plasma levels, HOMA and lipid panel were comparable in the two groups. Systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure at the 1st trimester were higher in OW/OB women with GDM (p < 0.05). GDM group showed adiponectin levels significantly lower than control group, at each trimester (p < 0.05). Adiponectin, fat mass, diastolic blood pressure and HOMA are independent predictors of GDM. CONCLUSIONS: OW/OB women who will develop GDM show lower adiponectin than euglycaemic group, across all pregnancy. Furthermore, at first trimester, they showed higher body fat and blood pressure levels than NGT group. Adiponectin, body fat, DBP and HOMA are independent predictors of GDM in OW/OB pregnant women. These results suggest the possibility of using adiponectin as early marker of GDM risk, at least in this cohort of women.

AB  - Birth denotes a sharp transition from constant placental nutrient delivery to independent regulation of energy intake and expenditure. Adiponectin, ghrelin, insulin and leptin are key hormones regulating appetite and energy homeostasis and could therefore be crucial components of postnatal adaptation. We studied the changes and relationships in these hormones and their correlation to clinical variables during adaptation to extrauterine life. Materials and Methods: Plasma venous adiponectin, ghrelin, insulin and leptin concentrations were measured at birth and controlled during early postnatal days (59.4 + 15.4 [SD] h, range 3693 h) for 38 healthy newborn infants [(20 male, 18 female), gestational age 40.2 + 0.9 wk (mean + SD), range 37.9 to 42.1 wk] born from uncomplicated pregnancies. Results: Median adiponectin concentration at birth was at 25. 1 mu g/mL (interquartile range 20. 0-29. 1 mu g/mL) and during early postnatal days 17. 8 mu g/mL (10.7-23.3; 95% CI of difference 26 to 46%). Median ghrelin concentration in cord plasma was 651 pg/mL (539-830) which during early postnatal days had decreased to 537 pg/mL (476-723; 95% CI 6 to 23%). At birth, median insulin concentration was 7.35 mU/L (6.53-9.43) and, during early postnatal days age, this was 4.35 mU/L (3.43-6.03; 95% CI 33 to 53%). At birth, median leptin concentration was 4.60 mu g/L (3.515.84) and during early postnatal days was 0. 83 mu g/L, (0. 65-1. 06; 95% CI 78 to 85%). At birth no correlation between hormone concentrations and gestational age or birth weight existed. During early postnatal days, adiponectin was positively (r=0. 49) correlated with ghrelin concentrations. Conclusion: In healthy term infants, the change from fetal to extrauterine life is accompanied by a decrease in circulating adiponectin, ghrelin, insulin and leptin suggesting distinct roles of these hormones in postnatal adaptation.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the effect of maternal diabetes on the concentrations of free and bound leptin at birth and during postnatal adaptation., METHODS: Total, bound, and free leptin concentrations and the percentage of free leptin were measured in cord plasma and plasma at 3 days of age of 13 term infants of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and 13 term infants of healthy mothers. Gestational age was 40.2 (1.4) weeks, and birth weight was 3693 (549) g (means (SD))., RESULTS: At birth, infants of mothers with GDM had significantly higher concentrations of total, bound, and free leptin and a higher percentage of free leptin (all p < 0.05). In all infants, these concentrations were significantly lower at 3 days of age than at birth (all p < 0.003), and the differences in concentrations of total, bound, and free leptin between the two groups were no longer significant. In infants of mothers with GDM, the percentage of free leptin remained unchanged, and was higher (p<0.05) than in infants of healthy mothers; in the latter group the percentage of free leptin significantly declined (p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: GDM appears to influence fetoplacental leptin metabolism. This effect may be mediated through altered maternal glucose metabolism, or insulinaemia, or both.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The purpose of this study was to examine whether fetal leptin concentration correlates with severity of chronic or subchronic fetal hypoxia as indicated by increased fetal concentrations of erythropoietin in fetuses of mothers with Type I (insulin dependent) diabetes mellitus., METHODS: We measured leptin and erythropoietin concentrations in cord plasma and amniotic fluid with radioimmunoassay in 25 pregnancies (gestational age 37.2 +/- 1.0 weeks). Fetuses with amniotic fluid erythropoietin over 22.5 mU/ml were classified as hypoxic (n = 9) and those with amniotic fluid erythropoietin below 22.5 mU/ml (n = 16) as non-hypoxic., RESULTS: The hypoxic fetuses had significantly higher cord leptin concentrations than non-hypoxic fetuses (median 36.8; range, 12.5-135.1 vs median 16.2; range, 3.7-52.2 micrograms/l), (p = 0.0066). Cord plasma leptin (n = 25) correlated directly with amniotic fluid erythropoietin (r = 0.727, p = 0.0001), with cord plasma erythropoietin (r = 0.644, p = 0.0005) and with the maternal last trimester HbA1C (r = 0.612, p = 0.0019) and negatively with cord artery pO2 (r = -0.440, p = 0.032), and pH (r = -0.414, p = 0.040)., CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Fetal leptin concentrations increased concomitantly with erythropoietin during chronic or subchronic hypoxia. This phenomenon could indicate a role for leptin in fetal adaptation to hypoxia.

AB  - AIM: To study the effect of maternal pre-eclampsia on cord plasma leptin concentrations in preterm infants., METHODS: Leptin concentration was analysed in cord plasma of 74 preterm infants, gestational age 24 to 32 weeks. Of these, 14 were born to pre-eclamptic mothers, in 10 intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) was present, and 59 had been exposed antenatally to corticosteroids., RESULTS: The mean (SD) concentration of cord plasma leptin was 1.31 (0.88) microg/l. A significant correlation was found between leptin concentration and gestational age (r = 0.336; p = 0.0037). Leptin levels were higher in infants of pre-eclamptic mothers (p = 0.0007), in those with IUGR (p = 0.0005), and in infants exposed antenatally to corticosteroids (p = 0.02). In multiple regression analysis, leptin was associated with gestational age and maternal pre-eclampsia (both p < 0.05), but not with antenatal corticosteroids., CONCLUSIONS: Increased fetal leptin in maternal pre-eclampsia may reflect a physiological adaptation to fetal stress such as hypoxia.

AB  - There are substantial alterations in fuel homeostasis immediately after birth. Leptin is a putative regulator of energy metabolism. Consequently, the aim of this study was to examine whether there are changes in circulating leptin concentrations during the early postnatal period. Umbilical cord mixed blood samples were taken at delivery, and a venous blood sample was obtained at 3 d of age from 38 healthy newborn infants (20 male, 18 female; gestational age 36.3 to 41.9 wk) for analysis of leptin concentration with radioimmunoassay. Cord plasma leptin concentration was 9.7+/-5.2 microg/L (mean+/-SD), with no gender difference between male (8.6+/-4.6 microg/L) and female (10.9+/-5.6 microg/L) infants. In male newborns, cord plasma leptin concentration correlated with arm circumference (r = 0.48, p < 0.05), and in female newborns with body mass index (r = 0.62, p < 0.01), thickness of the s.c. fat (r = 0.54, p < 0.05), and arm circumference (r = 0.72, p < 0.01). By the third postnatal day, plasma leptin decreased similarly in male (to 1.8+/-0.4 microg/L, p < 0.001) and female (to 2.3+/-0.8 microg/L, p < 0.001) infants, when there was a significant gender difference in leptin levels (p = 0.01). At 3 d of age, plasma leptin correlated with weight (r = 0.49, p < 0.05) and arm circumference (r = 0.49, p < 0.05) in female but not in male newborns. In conclusion, 1) circulating leptin already correlates with adiposity at birth in female but not in male newborn infants and 2) leptin decreases markedly in both genders by the third postnatal day, and the gender difference with higher leptin levels in females develops by that time. Thus, the postnatal decrease in plasma leptin concentration may be a physiologically feasible adaptation to profound alterations in fuel homeostasis during the first days of extrauterine life.

AB  - Maternal parity influences size at birth, postnatal growth and body composition with firstborn infants being more likely to be smaller with increased fat mass, suggesting that adiposity is set in early life. The precise effect of parity on fat mass and its endocrine sensitivity remains unclear and was, therefore, investigated in the present study. We utilised an established sheep model in which perirenal-abdominal fat mass (the major fat depot in the neonatal sheep) increases similar to 10-fold over the first month of life and focussed on the impact of parity on glucocorticoid sensitivity and adipokine expression in the adipocyte. Twin-bearing sheep of similar body weight and adiposity that consumed identical diets were utilised, and maternal blood samples were taken at 130 days of gestation. One offspring from each twin pair was sampled at 1 day of age, coincident with the time of maximal recruitment of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), whilst its sibling was sampled at 1 month, when UCP1 had disappeared. Plasma leptin was lower in nulliparous mothers than in multiparous mothers, and offspring of nulliparous mothers possessed more adipose tissue with increased mRNA abundance of leptin, glucocorticoid receptor and UCP2, adaptations that persisted up to 1 month of age when gene expression for interleukin-6 and adiponectin was also raised. The increase in fat mass associated with firstborn status is therefore accompanied by a resetting of the leptin and glucocorticoid axis within the adipocyte. Our findings emphasise the importance of parity in determining adipose tissue development and that firstborn offspring have an increased capacity for adipogenesis which may be critical in determining later adiposity.

AB  - In developing countries, prenatal lipid-based nutrient supplements (LNSs) were shown to increase birth size; however, the mechanism of this effect remains unknown. Cord blood hormone concentrations are strongly associated with birth size. Therefore, we hypothesize that LNSs increase birth size through a change in the endocrine regulation of fetal development. We compared the effect of daily prenatal LNSs with multiple micronutrient tablets on cord blood hormone concentrations using a randomized, controlled design including 197 pregnant women from rural Burkina Faso. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) I and II, their binding proteins IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3, leptin, cortisol, and insulin were quantified in cord sera using immunoassays. LNS was associated with higher cord blood leptin mainly in primigravidae (+57%; P = 0.02) and women from the highest tertile of BMI at study inclusion (+41%; P = 0.02). We did not find any significant LNS effects on other measured cord hormones. The observed increase in cord leptin was associated with a significantly higher birth weight. Cord sera from small-for-gestational age newborns had lower median IGF-I (-9 mug/L; P = 0.003), IGF-II (-79 mug/L; P = 0.003), IGFBP-3 (-0.7 mug/L; P = 0.007), and leptin (-1.0 mug/L; P = 0.016) concentrations but higher median cortisol (+18 mug/L; P = 0.037) concentrations compared with normally grown newborns. Prenatal LNS resulted in increased cord leptin concentrations in primigravidae and mothers with higher BMI at study inclusion. The elevated leptin concentrations could point toward a higher neonatal fat mass.

AB  - Background: Elevated lipids in umbilical cord blood affect fetal programming, leading to a higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease in later life. However, the causes of changes in the lipid profile of umbilical cord blood are not clear yet. This study aimed for the first time to determine the association of asprosin concentration with TAG, TC, HDL-C, LDL-C concentrations and TAG/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio in umbilical cord blood as well as newborn anthropometric indices. This cross-sectional study was based on 450 mother- newborn pairs of a birth cohort study in Sabzevar, Iran. Multiple linear regression was used to estimate the association of lipid concentration and lipid ratios as well as birth weight (BW), birth length (BL), head circumference (HC) and chest circumference (CC) with asprosin in cord blood samples controlled for the relevant covariates. Result(s): In fully adjusted models, each 1 ng/mL increase in asprosin was associated with 0.19 (95% CI 0.06, 0.31, P < 0.01), 0.19 (95% CI 0.10, 0.29, P < 0.01), 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.25, P < 0.01), 0.17 (95% CI 0.09, 0.25, P < 0.01), 0.01 (95% CI 0.00, 0.013, P < 0.01), 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.01, P < 0.01), 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.01, P < 0.01) and 0.01 (95% CI 0.01, 0.01, P < 0.01) increase in TAG, TC, LDL-C, TAG/HDL-C, TC/HDL-C, LDL-C/HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio respectively. Moreover, higher asprosin levels was positively associated with newborn BW, BL, HC and CC; however, these associations were not statistically significant. Conclusion(s): Overall, our findings support the positive association between cord asprosin concentration and the development of atherogenic lipid profile in newborns. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this study in other populations.Copyright © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Although South Asian populations have high cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden in the world, their patterns of individual CVD risk factors have not been fully studied. None of the available algorithms/scores to assess CVD risk have originated from these populations. To explore the relevance of CVD risk scores for these populations, literature search and qualitative synthesis of available evidence were performed. South Asians usually have higher levels of both "classical" and nontraditional CVD risk factors and experience these at a younger age. There are marked variations in risk profiles between South Asian populations. More than 100 risk algorithms are currently available, with varying risk factors. However, no available algorithm has included all important risk factors that underlie CVD in these populations. The future challenge is either to appropriately calibrate current risk algorithms or ideally to develop new risk algorithms that include variables that provide an accurate estimate of CVD risk. © 2013 S.

AB  - The present study aimed to investigate visceral adipose tissue-specific serpin (vaspin) concentrations in serum and term placentas and relate these values to insulin resistance and lipid parameters in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). A total of 30 GDM subjects and 27 age-matched pregnant women with normal glucose tolerance (NGT, control) were included. Serum glucose, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), lipid profile, insulin, and vaspin were measured at the end of pregnancy, and homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were calculated. Vaspin mRNA and protein levels in placentas were measured by real-time fluorescence quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and Western blotting, respectively. Serum vaspin levels were significantly lower in the GDM group than in controls (0.49 +/- 0.24 vs 0.83 +/- 0.27 ng/mL, respectively; P<0.01). Three days after delivery, serum vaspin levels were significantly decreased in subjects with GDM (0.36 +/- 0.13 vs 0.49 +/- 0.24 ng/mL, P<0.01). However, in the GDM group, serum vaspin levels were not correlated with the parameters evaluated. In contrast, in the control group, serum vaspin levels were positively correlated with triglycerides (TG; r=0.45, P=0.02) and very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C; r=0.42, P=0.03). Placental mRNA vaspin (0.60 +/- 0.32 vs 0.68 +/- 0.32, P=0.46) and protein (0.30 +/- 0.08 vs 0.39 +/- 0.26; P=0.33) levels in the GDM group did not differ significantly from those in the control group, but were negatively correlated with neonatal birth weight in the GDM group (r=-0.48, P=0.03; r=-0.88; P<0.01). Our findings indicated that vaspin may be an important adipokine involved in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism and may also play a role in fetal development.

AB  - AIM: To assess whether small-for-gestational-age (SGA) - an indicator of poor fetal growth, may affect metabolic health biomarkers in infancy and explore the predictors., METHODS: This was a nested matched (1:2) prospective observational study of 65 SGA (birth weight < 10th percentile) and 130 optimal-for-gestational-age (OGA, birth weight 25th-75th percentiles, control) infants in the 3D birth cohort with subjects recruited in Canada from 1 May 2010 to 31 August 2012. The outcomes included homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and beta-cell function (HOMA-beta), circulating leptin and adiponectin concentrations at age 2 years., RESULTS: HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta, leptin and adiponectin concentrations were similar in SGA versus OGA infants. Female sex and accelerated growth in length during mid-infancy (3-12 months) were associated with higher HOMA-IR. Caucasian ethnicity and decelerated growth in weight during late infancy (12-24 months) were associated with lower HOMA-IR. Current BMI was positively associated with circulating adiponectin in SGA infants only (+13.4% [4.0%-23.7%] per BMI z score increment)., CONCLUSION: Insulin resistance and secretion, circulating leptin and adiponectin levels were normal in SGA subjects in infancy at age 2 years. The novel observation in SGA-specific positive association between current BMI and circulating adiponectin suggests dysfunctional adiposity-adiponectin negative feedback loop development during infancy in SGA subjects.

AB  - CONTEXT: Fetal overgrowth "programs" an elevated risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Plausibly, adipokines may be involved in programming metabolic health., OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to evaluate whether large-for-gestational-age (LGA), an indicator of fetal overgrowth, is associated with altered circulating leptin and adiponectin levels in infancy, and assess the determinants., METHODS: In the Canadian 3D birth cohort, we studied 70 LGA (birth weight > 90th percentile) and 140 optimal-for-gestational-age (OGA, 25th-75th percentiles) infants matched by maternal ethnicity, smoking, and gestational age at delivery. The primary outcomes were fasting leptin, and total and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin concentrations at age 2 years., RESULTS: LGA infants had higher body mass index (BMI) than OGA infants. However, there were no significant differences in leptin, and total and HMW adiponectin concentrations. Leptin concentrations were positively associated with female sex, weight (z score) gain 0 to 24 months, current BMI, and the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness, and negatively associated with maternal age and White ethnicity. Female sex was associated with lower total and HMW adiponectin concentrations. Weight (z score) gain 0 to 24 months and current BMI were positively correlated with total and HMW adiponectin concentrations in LGA infants only., CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that LGA does not matter for circulating leptin and adiponectin concentrations in infancy, and there may be LGA-specific positive associations between weight gain or current BMI and adiponectin concentrations in infancy, suggesting dysfunction in establishing the adiposity-adiponectin negative feedback loop in LGA individuals.

AB  - There are very limited clinically viable treatment options for acute liver failure, a life-threatening condition that rapidly progresses to loss of liver function. In this study, we aim to evaluate the therapeutic potential of UCBP for acute liver failure induced in a rat model by D-galactosamine (GalN). F344 rats were randomly divided into two groups (control and UCBP-treated) after GalN injection. The therapeutic effects of UCBP were evaluated based on survival rate, H&E staining, TUNEL, PCNA staining, and in vivo BrdU labeling. Hepatocyte proliferation and the therapeutic mechanisms of UCBP were examined with BrdU and Western blot assay in vitro. The survival rate in the UCBP-treated group was found to be increased compared to the control group (85 vs 55%, P = 0.029). UCBP treatment significantly decreased apoptosis and increased cell proliferation. These effects may be secondary to specific bioactive molecules in UCBP. In vitro experiments revealed that adiponectin is one of the key biologically active components of UCBP in facilitating this result and promoting hepatocyte proliferation. Furthermore, this effect is mediated by p38/ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways. Therefore, this uncomplicated and clinically accessible approach may serve as effective bridge therapy for acute liver failure.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin in breast milk with the weight growth velocity of infants with exclusive breastfeeding., METHODS: A total of 67 full-term singleton infants who received regular child care and exclusive breastfeeding and their mothers were enrolled. The nutritional status was evaluated based on the measurements of body weight and body length (underweight, growth retardation, emaciation, overweight, and obesity). Z score was used to calculate growth velocity, and according to the DELTAZ score, the infants were divided into poor growth group, low growth velocity group, and normal growth velocity group. Mature breast milk samples were collected from their mothers, and ELISA was used to measure the levels of leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin., RESULTS: The emaciation group had a significantly lower level of leptin in breast milk than the non-emaciation group (P<0.05), and the overweight/obesity group had a significantly lower level of adiponectin than the non-overweight/obesity group (P<0.05). The correlation analysis showed that the level of ghrelin in breast milk was positively correlated with Z score of current body weight and DELTAZ score compared with birth weight (rs=0.280 and 0.290 respectively; P<0.05). The regression analysis showed that the level of ghrelin in breast milk was an important influencing factor for the Z score of body weight (beta=0.161, P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: Various active constituents in breast milk, including leptin, adiponectin, and ghrelin, may regulate the growth and development of infants to a certain degree, but long-term studies and observation are needed to investigate their association with offspring growth and development and the health-promoting effect of breast milk on offspring.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Being born as small for gestational age (SGA) has an increased risk of developing metabolic/cardiovascular disturbances in later life. The role of adiponectin in the metabolic disturbance in SGA children remained undefined., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the association between serum levels of adiponectin and insulin sensitivity as well as lipid profile in short children born SGA at prepubertal ages., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum levels of adiponectin, fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-I, IGFBP-1, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) and Apo B were measured in 30 prepubertal short children born SGA. Insulin resistance (IR) and beta-cell function were assessed using the method of homeostatic model (HOMA). Data were compared to those of 30 short appropriate for gestational age (AGA) children matched for age, gender, height and body mass index, and correlation analysis was performed., RESULTS: Short SGA children had significantly higher levels of fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and HOMA-beta but lower levels of adiponectin than short AGA controls. No significant differences in the level of IGFBP-1 and IGF-I were found between the two groups. Serum levels of TC, TG, Apo B and Apo B/ApoA-I ratio were significantly higher in SGA, with 33% of hypercholesteraemia and 23% of hyperglyceridaemia. Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that serum adiponectin level was negatively correlated with HOMA-IR and TG and was positively correlated with birthweight SDS in SGA children., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that low serum adiponectin levels are associated with reduced insulin sensitivity and unfavourable lipid profiles in short children born SGA at prepubertal ages.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the impact of the backfat thickness of sows on reproductive performance and on lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation. At farrowing, 60 sows were assigned to three groups: the low-backfat-thickness group (LBF, n = 20): sows' backfat thickness was between 9 and 12 mm; the medium-backfat-thickness group (MBF, n = 20): sows' backfat thickness was between 13 and 20 mm; and the high-backfat-thickness group (HBF, n = 20): sows' backfat thickness was between 21 and 25 mm. Maternal and fetal blood and placental samples were collected. Compared with the LBF and HBF groups, the MBF group delivered a significantly greater number of live piglets than the LBF or HBF groups. The different backfat thicknesses of sows had different effects on the lipid-related hormones and adipokines of maternal and fetal serum and placenta. Sows with poor or excessive backfat displayed higher levels of oxidative stress and higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines. According to these data, the thickness of a sow's backfat affects the characteristics of farrowing piglets and their lipid metabolism, as well as placental inflammation, maternal inflammation, and oxidative stress. A moderate backfat thickness (between 13 and 20 mm) was associated with greater reproductive performance in sows.

AB  - To examine the effects of maternal resveratrol in rats borne to dams with gestational high-fat diet (HFD)/obesity with or without postnatal high-fat diet. We first tested the effects of maternal resveratrol intake on placenta and male fetus brain in rats borne to dams with gestational HFD/obesity. Then, we assessed the possible priming effect of a subsequent insult, male offspring were weaned onto either a rat chow or a HFD. Spatial learning and memory were assessed by Morris water maze test. Blood pressure and peripheral insulin resistance were examined. Maternal HFD/obesity decreased adiponectin, phosphorylation alpha serine/threonine-protein kinase (pAKT), sirtuin 1 (SIRT1), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in rat placenta, male fetal brain, and adult male offspring dorsal hippocampus. Maternal resveratrol treatment restored adiponectin, pAKT, and BDNF in fetal brain. It also reduced body weight, peripheral insulin resistance, increased blood pressure, and alleviated cognitive impairment in adult male offspring with combined maternal HFD and postnatal HFD. Maternal resveratrol treatment restored hippocampal pAKT and BDNF in rats with combined maternal HFD and postnatal HFD in adult male offspring dorsal hippocampus. Maternal resveratrol intake protects the fetal brain in the context of maternal HFD/obesity. It effectively reduced the synergistic effects of maternal HFD/obesity and postnatal HFD on metabolic disturbances and cognitive impairment in adult male offspring. Our data suggest that maternal resveratrol intake may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy in the context of maternal HFD/obesity.

AB  - Obesity has reached epidemic proportions, and pregnancies in obese mothers have increased risk for complications including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, pre-term birth and caesarian section. Children born to obese mothers are at increased risk of obesity and metabolic disease and are susceptible to develop neuropsychiatric and cognitive disorders. Changes in placental function not only play a critical role in the development of pregnancy complications but may also be involved in linking maternal obesity to long-term health risks in the infant. Maternal adipokines, i.e., interleukin 6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), leptin and adiponectin link maternal nutritional status and adipose tissue metabolism to placental function. Adipokines and metabolic hormones have direct impact on placental function by modulating placental nutrient transport. Nutrient delivery to the fetus is regulated by a complex interaction including insulin signaling, cytokine profile and insulin responsiveness, which is modulated by adiponectin and IL-1 beta. In addition, obese pregnant women are at risk for hypertension and preeclampsia with reduced placental vascularity and blood flow, which would restrict placental nutrient delivery to the developing fetus. These sometimes opposing signals regulating placental function may contribute to the diversity of short and long-term outcomes observed in pregnant obese women. This review focuses on the changes in adipokines and obesity-related metabolic hormones, how these factors influence placental function and fetal development to contribute to long-term metabolic and behavioral consequences of children born to obese mothers.

AB  - Air pollution exposure during pregnancy has been associated with abnormal glucose hemostasis in the fetus, which may result in the programming of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) development in future life. Therefore, we investigated the association of maternal exposure to particulate matters (PMs) and traffic indicators with umbilical asprosin concentration, a novel insulin-resistant inducing adipokine, in newborns. Accordingly, 759 mother-newborn pairs from Sabzevar, Iran (2018-2019) participated in our study. Maternal exposure to PM1, PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations was estimated using spatial-temporal models developed for the study area. The associations of exposure to traffic indicators (total street length in 100, 300 and 500 m buffers around home and proximity of mothers to nearest major roads) and air pollution with umbilical asprosin concentration were estimated using linear regression models, adjusted for potential confounders. The median (interquartile range (IQR)) of umbilical asprosin concentration was 30.4 (19.1) ng/mL. In fully adjusted models, each one IQR increase in PM(10 )and PM2.5 were associated with 26.43 ng/mL (95% CI: 10.97, 41.88) and 31.76 ng/mL (95% CI: 15.66, 47.86) increase in umbilical asprosin concentration, respectively. A similarity result was observed for total street length in 100 m buffer. An increase in proximity to major roads was associated with a decrease of -21.48 ng/mL (95% CI: 33.29, -9.67) in umbilical asprosin concentration. Our results suggested that maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy could increase the umbilical asprosin concentration. These novel findings may improve our understanding of the mechanisms whereby air pollutants impaired glucose hemostasis during the fetal period. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes (GDM) with regard to third trimester adiponectin, leptin and insulin resistance, as well as to investigate their relation to fetal growth and macrosomia. 134 pregnant women were enrolled in the study: 86 with GDM and 48 controls. Maternal plasma adiponectin, leptin, fasting insulin, glucose and fetal biometry were measured between 27 and 32 weeks of gestation. Birthweight and delivery data were also assessed. Adiponectin in GDM patients was lower when compared to non-diabetic women while mean leptin concentration was not different. In GDM group only mothers' weight gain until third trimester was significantly different between the groups of patients with normal and accelerated fetal growth. No correlation of adiponectin and leptin with fetal growth was shown. Mothers' weight gain until third trimester and mean fasting glucose between 33 and 34 weeks of gestation were associated with neonatal macrosomia. There were no differences in adiponectin and leptin between mothers of macrosomic and non-macrosomic neonates. Fetal growth seems not to be related to third trimester adiponectin and leptin concentrations, while increased third trimester fasting glucose may be an independent risk factor of macrosomia.

AB  - CONTEXT & OBJECTIVE: A recent paper by our group reported that regular aerobic exercise during pregnancy led to lower foetal IGF-I and IGF-II concentrations and a modest reduction in offspring birth weight when compared with the offspring of nontraining control participants. Maternal hormonal alterations in response to exercise training may be associated with the regulation of nutrient availability for foetal growth through placental regulation of maternal metabolism., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the reduction in offspring size was associated with changes in the maternal IGF axis [including placental growth hormone (PGH)], leptin and/or free fatty acids (FFA) in response to aerobic exercise training in the second half of pregnancy., DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, controlled trial of exercise in pregnancy., PATIENTS: Eighty-four healthy nulliparous women (mean+/-SD age 30+/-4 year, BMI 25.5+/-4 kg/m(2) )., MEASUREMENTS: Serum samples were drawn at 19 and 35 weeks gestation to determine serum IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF-binding protein-1, IGF-binding protein-3, PGH, leptin and FFA., RESULTS: Exercise training in pregnancy had no impact on the pregnancy-related changes in the maternal IGF axis. Women in the exercise group experienced a 29% increase in leptin in late gestation (P=0.026 vs control) and a trend towards lower FFA (P=0.07 vs control). Late pregnancy changes in maternal leptin were inversely related to offspring birth weight (r= -0.24, P<0.05) and BMI (r= -0.25, P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: An increase in leptin in exercising pregnant women may reflect subtle changes within the placenta in response to regular exercise and may contribute to the reduction in offspring size previously reported in this cohort.

AB  - Breastfed infants have different growth patterns to formula-fed infants and are less likely to develop obesity later in life. Nesfatin-1 is an anorexigenic adipokine that was discovered in human milk more than a decade ago, and its role in infant appetite regulation is not clear. Our aim was to describe nesfatin-1 levels in human milk collected 3-4 months postpartum, associations with infant anthropometry, and factors (maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (mBMI), high weight gain during pregnancy, milk fat, and energy content) possibly influencing nesfatin-1 levels. We hypothesized that nesfatin-1 levels in mother's milk would differ for infants that were large (high weight-for-age Z-score (WAZ)) or small (low WAZ) at the time of milk sample collection. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to detect the nesfatin-1 concentration in milk samples from mothers to high WAZ (n = 50) and low WAZ (n = 50) infants. We investigated associations between nesfatin-1 levels and infant anthropometry at 3-4 months of age and growth since birth, using linear regression adjusted for mBMI, birth weight, infant sex, and exclusivity of breastfeeding. We found no difference in nesfatin-1 levels between the two groups and no association with infant anthropometry, even after adjusting for potential confounders. However, high nesfatin-1 levels were correlated with low mBMI. Future research should investigate serum nesfatin-1 level in both mothers, infants and associations with growth in breastfed children.

AB  - PURPOSE: Impaired angiogenesis of the developing placenta in the early pregnancy is one etiology of preterm delivery. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of normal angiogenesis. Leptin stimulates other angiogenic factors, including VEGF. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether levels of VEGF and leptin in amniotic fluid during the second trimester could serve as markers for preterm delivery., METHODS: This study was conducted on second trimester amniotic fluid samples obtained from women undergoing genetic amniocentesis at 16-20 weeks of gestation. VEGF and leptin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in every case of delivery at <37 weeks' gestation (n = 36) and in 36 matched controls who delivered at >= 37 weeks' gestation., RESULTS: Amniotic fluid VEGF levels in the preterm group (32.24 +/- 4.87 pg/ml) were significantly higher than those in the control group (23.49 +/- 2.09 pg/ml) (p < 0.05). Leptin levels in the amniotic fluid were higher in the preterm group (6.64 +/- 0.68 ng/ml) compared to the control group (5.35 +/- 0.59 ng/ml), but this difference was not significant. Amniotic fluid VEGF and leptin levels were highest in women with placenta previa and were lowest in women with intrauterine growth retardation and pregnancy-induced hypertension., CONCLUSIONS: These results show that amniotic fluid VEGF levels in the second trimester are more predictive of preterm delivery than leptin levels. This study also demonstrates that VEGF levels vary depending on the cause of preterm delivery.

AB  - Objective: We examined whether elevated blood pressure (BP) (>=120/80 mmHg) was associated with several anthropometric, metabolic, and clinical variables, including the family history of type 2 diabetes (FHD) and low birth weight, in young normal weight Japanese women. Methods: BP, body composition, and fasting glucose, insulin, lipids, lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, and adipokines were measured in 332 young Japanese women. They received a questionnaire on birth weight and FHD. Results: The prevalence of low birth weight was 2.4% and that of positive FHD was 22.9%. Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance averaged <1.5 and did not differ cross-sectionally between 32 women with elevated BP and 300 women with normal BP although mean body mass index was higher in the former than in the latter (21.7 +/- 2.9 kg/m2 vs. 20.8 +/- 2.2 kg/m2, P = 0.02). Women with elevated BP had higher fat mass index (P = 0.02) and trunk fat percentage (P = 0.04). They had lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and apolipoprotein A1 (both P = 0.01) while fasting triglycerides and apolipoprotein B did not differ. In addition, they had higher plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) (P = 0.001). Furthermore, the prevalence of low birth weight (9.4% vs. 1.7%, P = 0.03) and positive FHD (40.6% vs. 20.0%, P = 0.01) was higher in women with elevated BP. Multivariable logistic regression analyses revealed that elevated BP was independently associated with PAI-1 [odds ratio (OR); 1.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.08, P = 0.001], low birth weight (OR: 12.3, 95% CI: 2.3-67.3, P = 0.04), and FHD (OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.3-7.9, P = 0.01). Conclusion: Elevated BP was associated with positive FHD, low birth weight, and elevated serum PAI-1 in young normal weight Japanese women.

AB  - Background: We assessed the association of infant feeding with body composition and cardiometabolic health at 20 years in a setting where infant feeding is not associated with socioeconomic status. Materials and methods: Body size trajectory since birth, current body composition measured using whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and a broad range of cardiometabolic risk factors were compared cross-sectionally among young female university students who were ever breastfed (n = 158, 120 exclusively, and 38 mainly), mixed fed (n = 124), and formula fed (n = 15, 10 mainly, and 5 exclusively) Results: Compared with breastfed and mixed fed women, formula fed women had higher serum total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol although fat mass, fat distribution, fasting glucose, and insulin and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol did not differ. In addition, resting heart rates were higher in formula fed women compared with the other two groups of women although systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ. Further, formula fed women had higher adiponectin while serum leptin did not differ. There was no difference in birthweight, weight and height in childhood and adolescence, and glucose tolerance. On multivariate logistic regression analysis, formula feeding was associated with resting heart rates (odds ratio [OR]: 1.06, confidence interval [95% CI]; 1.01-1.12, p = 0.01) and adiponectin (OR: 1.3, 95% CI; 1.1-1.5, p < 0.001) independently of serum total and LDL cholesterol. Conclusions: Breastfeeding may be associated with favorable lipid profile and autonomic nervous function in young adults through mechanisms unrelated to adiposity, implicating potential long-term benefits of breastfeeding for cardiovascular health. Higher adiponectin in nonbreastfed women warrants further studies.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Epigenetic alterations are responsible for modulation of tissue-specific gene expression and genomic imprinting. Mechanisms include posttranslational modifications of core histones and DNA methylation. The review focuses on emerging data highlighting the potential for epigenetic modulation of gene expression in mediating early-life programming of increased risk of adult-onset disease. To illustrate these concepts, we focus on epigenetic programming of insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes, with emphasis on the potential role of the adipocyte and three of its products, fatty acids, leptin and tumour necrosis factor alpha., RECENT FINDINGS: Recent studies have highlighted potential mechanisms underlying epigenetic modification of tissue function that may predispose to later development of insulin resistance. These include altered regulation of adipocyte clonal expansion and terminal differentiation via epigenetic modification of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma, Foxo1 or cyclin D1 expression and signalling that, via altered adipocyte lipid sequestration, alters lipid delivery to nonadipose tissue and, therefore, insulin action or modification of adipokine or cytokine expression and signalling. Direct epigenetic modification of insulin action in muscle may be achieved through altered stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 expression, which correlates with low fatty acid oxidation., SUMMARY: While poor early growth and an increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood are undisputedly linked, the relative impact of environment or genotype remains unclear. Altered DNA methylation patterns could, potentially, serve as biomarkers for assessment of prognosis and could help in the development of prophylactic strategies.

AB  - Leptin has recently been implicated as having a role in sexual maturation and reproduction. This review describes recent findings regarding the putative reproductive functions of leptin within the context of the attainment of sufficient long-term fuel reserves to sustain and support pregnancy and lactation. The review considers the evidence, within the context of the development of hyperleptinaemia during pregnancy, that leptin has an important function to modulate maternal nutrient partitioning in order to optimise the provision of nutrients for fetal growth and development. It is suggested that, through modulation of maternal insulin secretion and hepatic metabolism, leptin integrates maternal nutrient storage to the nutrient requirements of the fetus. The importance of the placenta as a site of leptin synthesis and the potential role(s) of placentally derived leptin are evaluated in relation to maternal-fetal interactions during intrauterine development. The review also examines whether intrauterine growth retardation due to nutritional restriction reflects dysregulation of such cross-talk. Finally, the review describes emerging evidence for participation of leptin in lactation and neonatal growth.

AB  - Preeclampsia is a syndrome that affects approximately 2-8% of all pregnancies [1] and is closely linked to a particularly elevated inflammatory response, its presence resulting in high maternal and neonatal mortality. Several adipokins have been found to be involved in this process. Visfatin is a cytokine that exerts its effects especially on metabolism and immunity. In this study we determined the serum profile of Visfatin using the ELISA technique, to the 40 patients diagnosed with preeclampsia and we compared it to 16 pregnant patients without complications. Patients with preeclampsia had lower, but statistically not significant plasma levels compared to those in the control group, 11.04 +/- 7.14 (3.57-17.97) vs 8.88 +/- 7.91 (1.37-17.85). The lowest Visfatin levels have been recorded in the most severe form of preeclampsia. Visfatin does not significantly influence the birth weight of the foetuses (p = 0.08).

AB  - The contribution of placental leptin, if any, to both the fetal and maternal circulation and its role in pregnancy remains to be determined. In an experiment to investigate this, 27 placentae from term pregnancies were perfused ex vivo (gestational age=39.5 s.d. 1.2; range=38-42 weeks: fetal weight=3285 s.d. 482; range=2480-4420; birthweight centile range=4th to the 98th) at both the maternal and fetal interface. Placental leptin was exported into both the maternal and fetal circulations. The log leptin production by the maternal side of the placenta was significantly greater (P=0.001) than that for the fetal side (5.193 s.d.1.049 versus 4.387 s.d. 0.768 ng/placenta/min). There was no significant relationship between maternal and fetal log leptin production and maternal body mass index, birthweight, birthweight centile, ponderal index or gestational age or with cord blood pO(2), pCO(2) and pH. There was however, a significant increase in the maternal log leptin production with increasing fetal to placental weight ratio (P=0.017; r(2)=20.7 per cent) but no corresponding relationship for fetal leptin production. It is proposed that such a mechanism would allow the placenta to modulate fat supply to the fetus in response to the fetal demand relative to placental supply.

AB  - In pre-eclampsia, placental leptin is up-regulated and leptin is elevated in maternal plasma. To investigate potential epigenetic regulation of the leptin (LEP) gene in normal and complicated pregnancy, DNA methylation was assessed at multiple reported regulatory regions in placentae from control pregnancies (n=111), and those complicated by early onset pre-eclampsia (EOPET; arising <34 weeks; n=19), late onset pre-eclampsia (LOPET; arising >=34 weeks; n=18) and normotensive intrauterine growth restriction (nIUGR; n=13). The LEP promoter was hypomethylated in EOPET, but not LOPET or nIUGR placentae, particularly at CpG sites downstream of the transcription start site (-10.1%; P<0.0001). Maternal plasma leptin was elevated in EOPET and LOPET (P<0.05), but not nIUGR, compared with controls. EOPET cases showed a trend towards biallelic LEP expression rather than skewed allelic expression observed in control placentae, suggesting that loss of normal monoallelic expression at the LEP locus is associated with hypomethylation, leading to increased overall LEP expression.

AB  - To determine if poor maternal nutrition alters growth, body composition, circulating growth factors, and expression of genes involved in the development of muscle and adipose of offspring, 24 Dorset and Shropshire ewes were fed either 100% (control fed), 60% (restricted fed), or 126% (over fed) of National Research Council requirements. Diets began at day 116 +/- 6 of gestation until parturition. At parturition, 1 lamb from each control fed (CON), restricted fed (RES), and over fed (OVER) ewe was necropsied within 24 h of birth (1 d; n = 3/treatment) or reared on a control diet for 3 mo (CON = 5, RES = 5, and OVER = 3/treatment) and then euthanized. Body weights and blood samples were collected from lambs from 1 d to 3 mo. Organ weights, back fat thickness, loin eye area, and tissue samples (quadriceps, adipose, and liver) were collected at 1 d and 3 mo of age. The RES lambs weighed 16% less than CON (P = 0.01) between I d and 3 mo of age. In RES, there was a tendency for reduced heart girth at 1 d and 3 mo (P < 0.07) and back fat was reduced 36% at 3 mo (P = 0.03). Heart weight was 30% greater in OVER at 1 d when compared with RES lambs (P = 0.02). Serum IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were reduced in RES and OVER lambs (P < 0.05). Leptin tended to be greater in OVER lambs compared with CON at 1 d and 3 mo (P <= 0.08). Triiodothyronine was reduced in RES at 1 d (P = 0.05) and triglycerides tended to be greater in OVER at 3 mo (P = 0.07). In liver, there was a tendency for increased expression of IGF-I in OVER (P = 0.06) and decreased IGFBP-3 in RES (P = 0.09) compared with CON lambs at 1 d. In adipose tissue, adiponectin expression was decreased in RES (P = 0.05) at 3 mo. At 1 d of age, muscle expression of IGF-I tended to increase in RES (P = 0.06). In conclusion, poor maternal nutrition during gestation reduced growth rate in offspring which may be because of reduced circulating IGF-I and IGFBP-3 and decreased expression of IGFBP-3 in the liver.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin plays an important role in the regulation of body weight and energy metabolism in adults; its role in neonates also needs to be explored. The current study aims to determine the correlation between serum leptin concentrations and anthropometric variables in newborns and their mothers, and to examine the effects of sex, gestational age and antenatal steroid use on neonatal leptin levels., METHODS: This was a retrospective study. Blood samples were collected from 55 newborns within 24 hours of birth. Plasma leptin levels were measured by immunometric assay. The relationship between neonatal leptin levels and anthropometric parameters was determined using Pearson's correlation and further evaluated by linear regression analysis., RESULTS: Neonatal leptin was significantly correlated with maternal body weight (p < 0.002) and maternal body mass index (BMI) (p < 0.001). However, it was not correlated with gestational age (p = 0.130), birth weight (p = 0.097), or birth BMI (p = 0.336). The leptin levels in premature newborns (gestational age < 37 weeks; 0.69 +/- 1.82ng/mL) were significantly less than those in term newborns (gestational age > or = 37 weeks; 2.09 +/- 2.30 ng/mL, p = 0.031). There were no significant differences between sexes (p = 0.277) or in relation to antenatal steroid use (p = 0.611)., CONCLUSION: Neonatal serum leptin concentrations within 24 hours of birth correlated with maternal body weight and BMI, especially in premature newborns. Premature newborns had significantly lower leptin levels than full-term newborns.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Subjects born with low birth weight (LBW) display a more energy-conserving response to fasting compared with normal birth weight (NBW) subjects. However, the molecular mechanisms explaining these metabolic differences remain unknown. Environmental influences may dynamically affect epigenetic marks, also in postnatal life. Here, we aimed to study the effects of short-term fasting on leptin (LEP) and adiponectin (ADIPOQ) DNA methylation and gene expression in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) from subjects with LBW and NBW., METHODS: Twenty-one young LBW men and 18 matched NBW controls were studied during 36 h fasting. Eight subjects from each group completed a control study (overnight fast). We analyzed SAT LEP and ADIPOQ methylation (Epityper MassARRAY), gene expression (q-PCR), and adipokine plasma levels., RESULTS: After overnight fast (control study), LEP and ADIPOQ DNA methylation levels were higher in LBW compared to those in NBW subjects (p <= 0.03) and increased with 36 h fasting in NBW subjects only (p <= 0.06). Both LEP and ADIPOQ methylation levels were positively associated with total body fat percentage (p <= 0.05). Plasma leptin levels were higher in LBW versus NBW subjects after overnight fasting (p = 0.04) and decreased more than threefold in both groups after 36 h fasting (p <= 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate that fasting induces changes in DNA methylation. This was shown in LEP and ADIPOQ promoters in SAT among NBW but not LBW subjects. The altered epigenetic flexibility in LBW subjects might contribute to their differential response to fasting, adipokine levels, and increased risk of metabolic disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigated genetic determinants of adiponectin during pregnancy to reveal novel biology of adipocyte regulation., METHODS: A genome-wide association study was conducted in 1,322 pregnant women from the Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome Study with adiponectin measured at ~28 weeks of gestation. Variants reaching P < 5x10-5 for de novo genotyping in two replication cohorts (Genetics of Glycemic regulation in Gestation and Growth N = 522; ECOGENE-21 N = 174) were selected., RESULTS: In the combined meta-analysis, the maternal T allele of rs900400 located on chr3q25 (near LEKR1/CCNL1) was associated with lower maternal adiponectin (beta +/- standard error [SE] = -0.18 +/- 0.03 standard deviation [SD] of adiponectin per risk allele; P = 1.5 x10-8 ; N = 2,004; multivariable adjusted models). In contrast, rs900400 showed only nominal association with adiponectin in a large sample of nonpregnant women (beta +/- SE = -0.012 +/- 0.006; P = 0.05; N = 16,678 women from the ADIPOgen consortium). The offspring rs900400 T risk allele was associated with greater neonatal skinfold thickness (beta +/-SE = 0.19 +/- 0.04 SD per risk allele; P = 4.1x10-8 ; N = 1,489) and higher cord blood leptin (beta +/- SE = 0.28 +/- 0.05 log-leptin per risk allele; P = 8.2 x10-9 ; N = 502), but not with cord blood adiponectin (P = 0.23; N = 495). The T allele of rs900400 was associated with higher expression of TIPARP in adipocytes., CONCLUSIONS: These investigations of adipokines during pregnancy and early life suggest that rs900400 has a role in adipocyte function.

AB  - AIM: This study investigates the effect of rapid weight gain in term children, adolescents and young adults born appropriate for gestational age., METHODS: In all, 173 girls and 178 boys aged 6.1-19.9 (12.5 +/- 3.1)years participated. Rapid weight gain (group 1) was defined as a change in weight-SDS (standard deviation score) from birth till two years >0.67, 'no change' as > or =-0.67 and < or =0.67 (group 2) vs 'slow weight gain' as <-0.67 (group 3). BMI-SDS, waist circumference (WC) z-score, fat mass (FM)/fat free mass (FFM; Air-Displacement-Plethysmography), resting energy expenditure (REE; ventilated hood system), cardio-metabolic risk factors, serum leptin and adiponectin were assessed. >90th age-/sex-specific BMI-percentile was defined as overweight. Parental BMI, socio-economic status and lifestyle were assessed as confounders., RESULTS: A total of 22.8% gained weight rapidly, and 15.7% was overweight. Group 1 compared with group 2 and 3 subjects was taller, heavier and had a higher prevalence of overweight (girls/boys: 26.2%/28.9% vs 11.6%/19.0% vs 2.8%/5.0%; p < 0.01/p < 0.05). Concomitantly, a higher WC, %FM and FFM were observed. Rapid weight gain was positively associated with REE (adjusted for FFM) in boys (r = 0.26; p < 0.01), but not with cardio-metabolic risk factors., CONCLUSION: Rapid weight gain was related to increases in height, weight, a higher prevalence of overweight and central fat distribution. In addition, rapid weight gain was related to a higher REE in boys, but not to cardio-metabolic risk factors.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Maternal obesity impacts fetal growth as early as second trimester of pregnancy, yet little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved. We aimed to examine associations between maternal adipokines throughout pregnancy and neonatal size by prepregnancy obesity status., METHODS: In a prospective cohort of 2802 U.S. pregnant women from the NICHD Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (2009-2013), biospecimens were analyzed in a matched case-control subset of 321 women. Blood was collected at 10-14, 15-26 (fasting), 23-31, and 33-39 gestational weeks. Plasma leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) and total and high-molecular-weight (HMW)-adiponectin were measured. Free leptin was calculated as leptin/sOB-R. Birthweight was abstracted from medical records. Neonatal length and skinfolds were measured., RESULTS: Leptin and sOB-R in late pregnancy tended to be positively and negatively associated with neonatal length, respectively, while free leptin throughout pregnancy tended to be positively associated with length. Free leptin associations with neonatal length were differential by obesity (i.e., inversely among women without obesity and positively among women with obesity). A per unit increase in free leptin at 33-39 weeks was associated with a shorter neonatal length by -0.55 cm (95%CI, -0.83, -0.28) in women without obesity and longer length by 0.49 cm (95%CI, 0.34, 0.65) in women with obesity. HMW-adiponectin at 33-39 weeks was inversely associated with neonatal length (beta = -1.29 cm; 95%CI, -1.74, -0.85) and skinfold thickness (beta = -1.46 mm; 95%CI, -1.58, -0.56) among women with obesity. Free leptin across pregnancy tended to be negatively associated with neonatal skinfold thickness among women without obesity, while free leptin in early pregnancy was positively associated with skinfold thickness., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal adipokines were associated with multiple pathways that influence neonatal size including length and adiposity, which differed in timing across pregnancy and by prepregnancy obesity. These findings provide new potential insights into mechanisms and timing by which maternal obesity may impact fetal growth.

AB  - Objective . To examine the relationships between birth weight and body mass index, percent body fat, blood lipids, glycemia, insulin resistance, adipokines, blood pressure, and endothelial function in a cohort of obese adolescents. Design and Methods. Ninety-five subjects aged 10-16 years (mean age 13.5 years) with a body mass index >95th centile (mean [+/-SEM] 33.0 +/- 0.6) were utilized from two prospective studies for obesity prevention prior to any interventions. The mean term birth weight was 3527 +/- 64 g (range 1899-4990 g;). Results . Body mass index z-score correlated positively with birth weight (r (2) = 0.05, P = 0.03), but not percent body fat. Insulin resistance negatively correlated with birth weight (r (2) = 0.05, P < 0.001), as did fasting plasma insulin (r (2) = 0.05, P < 0.001); both being significantly greater for subjects of small versus large birth weight (DELTA Homeostasis Model Assessment = 2.5 and DELTA insulin = 10 pmol/L for birth weight <2.5 kg versus >4.5 kg). Adiponectin, but not leptin, blood pressure z-scores or peripheral arterial tomography values positively correlated with birth weight (r (2) = 0.07, P = 0.008). Conclusions . Excess body mass index in obese adolescents was positively related to birth weight. Birth weight was not associated with cardiovascular risk factors but represented a significant determinant of insulin resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare maternal and fetal leptin among women without diabetes, women with type 1 diabetes, and women with type 2 diabetes., METHODS: In a prospective study at the National Maternity Hospital, Dublin, 40 women with type 1 diabetes, 10 with type 2 diabetes, and 30 without diabetes were enrolled between July 2006 and July 2008. Maternal (36-week) and cord blood leptin was measured by enzyme-linked immunoassay., RESULTS: No difference was found in maternal leptin among the groups: without diabetes (mean, range): 325 pg/mL, 36-1492 pg/mL; type 1 diabetes: 343.2 pg/mL, 55.5-1108.2 pg/mL; type 2 diabetes: 202.2 pg/mL, 35.1-1553.3 pg/mL (P>0.05). Leptin levels were higher among fetuses of women with type 1 (223 pg/mL, 25.7-810 pg/mL) and type 2 (447.2 pg/mL, 136.3-679 pg/mL) diabetes than among women without diabetes (80.3 pg/mL, 27.3-623.1 pg/mL; P<0.05). The single significant predictor of fetal leptin for the whole cohort was maternal body mass index (BMI; r=0.39, P=0.01). Only third-trimester glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was significantly related to fetal leptin after controlling for maternal BMI among women with diabetes (r=0.28, P=0.04)., CONCLUSION: Fetuses of women with diabetes might have some degree of leptin resistance. This might be important in appetite regulation in extrauterine life. Copyright © 2012 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The obesity epidemic, including childhood obesity, is rapidly gaining strength as one of the most significant challenges to the health of the global community in the 21st Century. The proportion of women who are obese at the beginning of pregnancy is also increasing. These women and their babies are at high risk of pregnancy complications, and of programming for metabolic disease in adult life. In particular, maternal obesity is associated with aberrant fetal growth, encompassing both growth restricted and large for gestational age, or macrosomic fetuses. This article considers the potential effect of obesity and adipose tissue on placental nutrient exchange mechanisms in relation to aberrant fetal growth. The review emphasizes the dearth of work on this topic to date despite its importance to current and future healthcare of the population. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - To determine the factors associated with high molecular weight adiponectin (HMW-ad) levels during the first year of life, the longitudinal changes in serum HMW-ad were investigated from birth to 12 mo of age. The total adiponectin levels, HMW-ad, and leptin were measured longitudinally from birth to 12 mo of age in 56 healthy infants (>or=35 wk of gestation). Serum HMW-ad levels were positively correlated with total adiponectin levels (R2 = 0.93, p < 0.0001). Serum HMW-ad levels at birth, six, and 12 mo were 13.7 +/- 0.9 (mean +/- SE), 13.3 +/- 0.8, and 7.7 +/- 0.5 microg/mL, respectively. The levels at 12 mo were significantly lower than those at birth and 6 mo, respectively. In a multiple regression analysis, the HMW-ad levels at 12 mo were found to be related only to cord blood HMW-ad levels (beta = 0.680, p < 0.001) and not to any other factors. These results imply that postnatal production of HMW-ad at least during infancy may be regulated before birth. Further study is necessary to determine whether cord blood HMW-ad has an effect and whether it is involved in the development of metabolic syndrome.

AB  - Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) are required by the embryo and oocytes, but until around 25 weeks of gestation, their accumulation by the fetus is relatively small and increases logarithmically with gestational age. Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) are involved in neurotransmission and retinal function; additionally, AA is of particular importance for growth and development. In humans, mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation plays an important role in placental and fetal metabolism. The sources of PUFA needed to sustain fetal growth are both maternal diet and fat stores and fetal synthesis. In the maternal circulation, PUFAs are carried in their esterified form by plasma lipoproteins; both placental lipoprotein receptors and lipases ensure that they are hydrolyzed before or after their receptor-mediated uptake and fatty acids are released to the fetal circulation. Nonesterified fatty acids in maternal plasma could also be a source of PUFAs for the fetus, crossing the placenta, thanks to the fatty acid-binding proteins and fatty acid transfer proteins. Pregnancy is a state of mild controlled inflammation, and eicosanoids derived from PUFAs can modulate the proinflammatory/anti-inflammatory balance at various points. On the contrary, the role of PUFAs in placental oxidative stress is controversial, with different authors reporting that PUFAs either limit oxidative stress, have no effect, or cause an increase in oxidative stress. Some bioactive proteins called adipokines can be synthesized by the placenta, as is the case of leptin, or have their effect on the placenta by interacting with their receptors, as is the case for adiponectin and others. These adipokines can be also synthesized by the fetus and have different effects on maternal metabolism and fetal development. Supplementation of n-3 PUFA has been shown to modulate the expression of these adipokines in maternal, placental, or fetal tissues, although additional studies are necessary to determine their precise role in fetal growth.

AB  - More glucose crosses the placenta than any other substrate, but correlations between its concentration in maternal plasma and fetal growth are not found consistently. The accumulation of maternal fat depots and hyperlipidemia are the two principal changes in lipid metabolism during pregnancy. Although lipids cross the placenta with difficulty, maternal plasma triacylglycerols (TAG) and non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) correlate with fetal lipids, fetal growth and fat mass under certain conditions. In intrauterine growth restriction, impaired placental transfer of lipophilic compounds (long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids and lipophilic vitamins) seems to underpin metabolic dysfunction and decreased birth weight. In gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), maternal TAG and NEFA levels correlate with neonatal anthropometric measures. In GDM, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein in fetuses correlated with neonatal fat mass; changes in maternal or cord blood leptin, retinol binding protein 4 and adiponectin concentrations have been related to neonatal fat mass or birth weight, although their importance remains to be investigated. The angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL-4) is secreted from adipose tissue, liver and placenta, and irreversibly inhibits lipoprotein lipase (LPL) activity. Maternal plasma ANGPTL-4 is decreased in GDM, and it has been proposed to be responsible for an increase in placental LPL activity, which would facilitate a greater fatty acid placental transfer, contributing to the higher fetal fat accumulation. Thus, while evidence suggesting major involvement of maternal lipid metabolism in fetal adiposity and growth exists, the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Irisin is considered to be a myokine and adipokine that may also participate in reproductive functions, as it increases significantly throughout pregnancy. However, the regulation of circulating irisin and its relationship with other cytokines has not been assessed thus far in pregnant women and their offspring., OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate differences in irisin and cytokine concentrations between women at the end of pregnancy and their offspring, as well as the relationship between maternal and newborn irisin and maternal and newborn biomarkers., METHODS: Twenty-eight mother/newborn pairs were included in this study. The following biomarkers were evaluated in maternal venous and arterial umbilical cord blood samples: irisin, 27 cytokine panel, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), total plasma protein, and free fatty acid concentration., RESULTS: The newborns had significantly lower irisin concentrations compared to their mothers (p = 0.03), but this difference was present only in babies born from mothers without labor prior to cesarean section delivery (p = 0.01). No significant differences in maternal and newborn irisin concentrations were found between diabetic and non-diabetic mothers or between overweight/obese and normal weight mothers. A significant positive correlation was found between TAC level and irisin concentration in newborns. Maternal and newborn interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-1RA, IL-5, IL-7, and interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10 levels were significantly positively correlated with irisin concentrations in both study groups. In addition, maternal IL1beta, IL-5, IL-7, and IP-10 levels positively predicted maternal irisin concentrations. Furthermore, arterial cord blood TAC and IL-1beta and IL1-RA levels positively predicted newborn irisin concentrations. Multiple regression analyses showed that maternal IL-13 negatively predicted offspring irisin levels (p = 0.03) and that maternal IL-1beta positively predicted newborn irisin concentrations (p = 0.046)., CONCLUSION: No evidence was found that serum irisin concentrations in mothers at pregnancy termination or those of their newborns correlated with maternal body mass index, the presence of diabetes mellitus, or free fatty acid levels. However, the results of this study indicated that cytokines might predict irisin concentration in mothers and their offspring, although interactions between irisin levels during pregnancy and the newborn have not yet been fully elucidated.

AB  - Objective: Hormones produced by fat tissue, adipokines, produced during intrauterine life have recently been implicated in fetal growth. Vaspin is an adipokine expressed in visceral adipose tissue and has insulin-sensitizing effects. Elevated serum vaspin concentrations are associated with alterations in insulin sensitivity. We aimed to determine if vaspin concentrations in cord blood from healthy, term newborns differ among those born small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and large for gestational age (LGA). A secondary objective was to determine whether an association existed between vaspin and anthropometric measurements, glucose and insulin levels in the newborn., Methods: The study population included healthy term newborns, 30 subjects in the SGA, 12 in the AGA, and 34 in the LGA group. Anthropometry was documented in all subjects. Blood was taken from the umbilical cord vein from each child for later analysis for vaspin, insulin and glucose concentrations., Results: Cord blood vaspin, insulin and glucose concentrations were not different between the three study groups. A negative correlation between vaspin and glucose concentrations was demonstrated in the whole cohort (r=-0.364, p=0.001). This correlation was also observed in the LGA group (r=-0.482, p=0.004). Glucose concentrations significantly predicted vaspin concentrations (r2=0.132, p=0.001)., Conclusion: We found a negative association between glucose and vaspin concentrations in umbilical cord blood. In addition there was a predictive association between blood glucose and resulting vaspin concentration, suggesting that vaspin can be used as a predictor of alterations in the insulin-glucose metabolism from birth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adipokines are produced by adipose tissue and are involved in metabolic processes. Omentin-1 is an adipokine that has been shown in vitro to possibly be involved in insulin sensitivity modulation. The prenatal stage is a crucial period for development of metabolic diseases in the long term, therefore, small (SGA) and large (LGA) for gestational age newborns have an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome later in life., AIMS: To evaluate the differences in omentin-1 concentrations in umbilical cord blood from healthy term newborns according to birth weight and explore the association between omentin-1 and anthropometry, glucose, insulin and insulin sensitivity., STUDY DESIGN: This was a secondary analysis of stored umbilical cord blood of term newborns., SUBJECTS: Newborns classified according to birth weight as SGA (n=30), adequate for gestational age (AGA) (n=12) and LGA (n=34)., OUTCOME MEASURES: An analysis of omentin-1, glucose and insulin were performed., RESULTS: Differences were found in serum omentin-1 levels (ng/mL) between SGA 328.17+/-108.04, AGA 253.05+/-98.25 and LGA 250.91+/-100.48 (p=0.009). In the linear regression analysis, the independent variables HOMA-IR, QUICK-I and FGIR were predictors of serum omentin-1 levels (r=0.175, p=0.003)., CONCLUSIONS: Omentin-1 cord blood levels have a differentiated behavior according to weight for gestational age with LGA newborns having lower levels and SGA newborns higher levels. HOMA-IR, QUICK-I and FGIR weakly predicted omentin-1 in cord blood, suggesting that omentin-1 possibly has an implication in insulin sensitivity since birth. Copyright © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Rapid early growth is associated with adverse metabolic outcome. The aim of this study was to determine whether there are differences in body composition (BC) between very-low-birth-weight preterm (VLBWPT) infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) and whether these differences relate to first-year growth. Twenty-six VLBWPT (15 AGA and 11 SGA). The BC was analyzed by dual X-ray absorptiometry at 2 years, and insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) I and II and leptin were administered weekly for 8 weeks and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. At 24 months, the VLBW SGA infants were lighter and had less peripheral fat and lean mass than VLBW AGA infants. In all patients, the percentage of fat mass correlated inversely with the change in weight [standard deviation scores (SDS)] from newborn to 2 and 4 weeks and the 1-month leptin and lean mass (SDS) correlated inversely with the change in weight (SDS) from newborn to 2, 4, and 8 weeks and with 4-week IGF-I and 8-week IGF-II. Lean mass (SDS) inversely correlated with 6-month IGF-I and directly correlated with 1-week and 3-month IGF-I in SGA VLBW infants only. A longer follow-up period will show whether additional differences will develop later.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Caesarean section rates have increased in parallel with those of obesity. Decreased levels of adiponectin, an adipocyte-derived metabolic hormone present in abundant concentrations in cord blood and breast milk, have been documented in association with obesity in children and adults., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the mode of delivery affects adiponectin concentrations in cord blood of healthy term infants., METHODS: The cord blood adiponectin concentration was measured in 159 consecutive term infants, of whom 131 (82.4%) were born by vaginal delivery, 15 (9.4%) by nonelective caesarean section and 13 (8.2%) by elective caesarean section., RESULTS: The mean adiponectin level was significantly lower in infants born by elective caesarean section compared with those born by vaginal delivery: 15.3 microg/ml (SD = 6.8) and 21.6 microg/ml (SD = 7.3), respectively (p = 0.015). This difference remained significant after adjustment for the infants' gender and birth weight as well as maternal weight and weight gain during pregnancy., CONCLUSION: Elective caesarean section may carry a risk of obesity independently of maternal risk factors.

AB  - Leptin influences satiety, adiposity, and metabolism and is associated with mechanisms regulating puberty onset, fertility, and pregnancy in various species. Maternal hyperleptinemia is a hallmark of mammalian pregnancy, although both the roles of leptin and the mechanisms regulating its synthesis appear to be taxa specific. In pregnant humans and nonhuman primates, leptin is produced by both maternal and fetal adipose tissues, as well as by the placental trophoblast. Specific receptors in the uterine endometrium, trophoblast, and fetus facilitate direct effects of the polypeptide on implantation, placental endocrine function, and conceptus development. A soluble isoform of the receptor may be responsible for inducing maternal leptin resistance during pregnancy and/or may facilitate the transplacental passage of leptin for the purpose of directly regulating fetal development. The steroid hormones are linked to the regulation of leptin and the leptin receptor and probably interact with other pregnancy-specific, serum-borne factors to regulate leptin dynamics during pregnancy. In addition to its effects on normal conceptus development, leptin is linked to mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and intrauterine growth restriction. Association with these anomalies and with mechanisms pointing to a fetal origin for a range of conditions affecting the individual's health in adult life, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease, reiterate the need for continued research dedicated to elucidating leptin's roles and regulation throughout gestation.

AB  - Leptin produced by both adipose tissue and the placental trophoblast, has been proposed to regulate numerous aspects of human conceptus development. Although recent animal studies have suggested an additional role for the polypeptide in fetal lung maturation, no evidence has been reported in primates. Therefore, we employed the baboon (Papio sp.), a well-characterized primate model for human pregnancy, to determine the presence and ontogeny of leptin receptor in fetal lung with advancing gestation. Lungs were collected from fetal baboons, early in gestation (days 58-62, n = 4), at mid gestation (days 98-102, n = 4), and late in gestation (days 158-165, n = 4) (term 184 days). mRNA transcripts for leptin (LEP) and both long and short intracellular domain isoforms of the leptin receptor (LEP-R(L) and LEP-R(S)) were assessed by RT-PCR. leptin receptor protein was evaluated by immunoblotting and cell types expressing leptin receptor were identified in late pregnancy by immunohistochemistry. Fetal serum leptin concentrations, determined by RIA, remained relatively unchanged at 5.7 +/- 1.1 ng/ml (mean +/- s.e.m.) in mid pregnancy and 8.4 +/- 3.0 ng/ml in late pregnancy (P > 0.05). Although leptin were detectable in fetal lung, no changes in transcript abundance were apparent with advancing gestation. However, transcripts for both LEP-R(L) and LEP-R(S) receptor isoforms increased several-fold (P < 0.05) in fetal lung between mid and late gestation, while leptin receptor protein was detectable only in late pregnancy. leptin receptor was localized in distal pulmonary epithelial cells, including type II pneumocytes. In conclusion, leptin is present in the fetal baboon and its receptor is enhanced during late gestation in cells responsible for the synthesis of pulmonary surfactant. Collectively, these and past findings may suggest a modulatory role for the polypeptide in pulmonary development and/or may identify leptin receptor as a physiological marker of primate fetal lung maturity.

AB  - Leptin is a polypeptide hormone that aids in the regulation of body weight and energy homeostasis and is linked to a variety of reproductive processes in both animals and humans. Thus, leptin may help regulate ovarian development and steroidogenesis and serve as either a primary signal initiating puberty or as a permissive regulator of sexual maturation. Perhaps significantly, peripheral leptin concentrations, adjusted for adiposity, are dramatically higher in females than in males throughout life. During primate pregnancy, maternal levels that arise from adipose stores and perhaps the placenta increase with advancing gestational age. Proposed physiological roles for leptin in pregnancy include the regulation of conceptus growth and development, fetal/placental angiogenesis, embryonic hematopoiesis, and hormone biosynthesis within the maternal-fetoplacental unit. The specific localization of both leptin and its receptor in the syncytiotrophoblast implies autocrine and/or paracrine relationships in this endocrinologically active tissue. Interactions of leptin with mechanisms regulating pre-eclampsia and maternal diabetes have also been suggested. Collectively, therefore, reports suggest that a better understanding of the regulation of leptin and its role(s) throughout gestation may eventually impact those causes of human perinatal morbidity and mortality that are exacerbated by intrauterine growth retardation, macrosomia, placental insufficiency, or prematurity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Critical metabolic changes preparing for ex utero life may occur at the fetal age of approximately 28-32 weeks, and preterm birth <28 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) may affect these pathways. Children born <28 weeks often have poorer outcomes possibly due to a major shift in metabolism, including nutritional supply and a shift in lipid-transporting particles and lipid profile. This shift may occur in apolipoprotein and adipocytokine levels, which may influence metabolism., OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a shift in apolipoprotein and adipocytokine levels in neonates born at a gestational age (GA) of 28 and 32 weeks, respectively., METHODS: Blood samples from 47 infants (GA 32 weeks, n = 30 and GA 28 weeks, n = 17) were collected at birth and, in the GA28 group, also at PMA 32 weeks. Apolipoproteins A-1, A-2, B, C-2, C-3, and E were analyzed, as well as adiponectin and leptin levels., RESULTS: Serum levels of apolipoproteins A-1, C-2, C-3, and E were lower at birth in the GA28 group compared to the GA32 group. Adiponectin and leptin levels were low at birth in the GA28 group. In the GA28 group 4 weeks after birth, leptin levels were still low, whereas adiponectin levels had increased to levels similar to those found at birth in the GA32 group. Apolipoprotein A-1, C-2, C-3, and E levels were negatively correlated with days receiving total parenteral nutrition., CONCLUSION: There are significant differences in apolipoprotein and adipocytokine levels, which can be associated with GA and birth weight. The impact of these changes on neonatal and future morbidity remains to be determined. Copyright © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - UNLABELLED: Leptin, a hormone produced in adipose tissue and placenta, is potentially important in relation to energy metabolism and growth. We investigated the effect of cigarette smoking on maternal plasma leptin concentration during pregnancy, and on plasma leptin concentration and weight among infants up to 13 wk of age. Plasma leptin concentration was measured in women in week 18 (n = 203) and week 35 (n = 164) of pregnancy, while cotinine (nicotine metabolite) was measured in plasma sampled from mothers in week 35 of pregnancy (n = 159). Leptin concentration was also measured in plasma from the umbilical cord (n = 133) and from 4-wk-old (n = 129) and 13-wk-old (n = 130) infants. There was no difference in plasma leptin concentration between smoking and non-smoking mothers at 18 wk and at 35 wk of pregnancy. Plasma cotinine concentration was higher in smoking than in non-smoking mothers, and a negative correlation between plasma cotinine and leptin concentrations was found. The leptin concentrations in umbilical cord plasma were similar, although the birthweights of newborns from smoking mothers were significantly lower than those from non-smoking mothers. The plasma leptin concentrations were similar between the two groups also at 4 wk of age. At 13 wk of age, infants of smoking mothers had significantly higher plasma leptin concentrations than infants of non-smoking mothers., CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that a lower birthweight of neonates among smoking mothers is not due to altered plasma leptin concentration.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin is a highly hydrophilic protein that circulates in plasma as a 16-kDa protein. It is produced in adipose tissue and also recently described to be synthesized by placental tissue. Plasma concentration of leptin is positively correlated to body fat mass, and administration of recombinant leptin to mice indicates that leptin participates in the regulation of food intake and energy expenditure. Leptin may have a role during initiation of human pubertal development. Gender differences have been reported among adults as well as among children, even after correction for body fat content. Little is known about variation in leptin levels during pregnancy or the level or function of leptin in the growing fetus and infants. The aim of the present study was to examine plasma concentration of leptin in pregnant women and their newborn infants during the first 3 months of life, and to relate plasma leptin concentration to body weight and gender during this period., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Among 609 women recruited to study the effect of very long-chain n-3 fatty acids during pregnancy, 180 women were selected to study leptin as well. The women were all healthy and nulli- or primiparas, and 16% were smokers. The study was randomized and double-blinded, and the participants received either 10 mL of cod liver oil (Peter Moller, avd.av Orkla ASA, Oslo, Norway) daily or the same amount of corn oil. Blood samples were taken from the mothers during pregnancy in weeks 18 and 35, and from the umbilical cord and from 4- and 14-week-old infants. The mothers' body mass index (BMI) at 18 and 35 weeks of pregnancy was calculated by using body weight recorded within 1 week or, if this was missing, by using means from weights at the closest time points before and after the sampling. The infants were weighed and measured at local health care centers. Plasma leptin concentration was measured by radio immunoassay (Linco Research, St Charles, MO) using recombinant 125I-leptin as tracer., RESULTS: We found no differences between the group receiving cod liver oil and the group receiving corn oil in any of the measured variables; thus, the groups are treated statistically as one. Leptin concentration in maternal plasma increased during pregnancy from 15.5 +/- 9.0 microg/L (n = 175) in week 18 to 17.7 +/- 10.7 microg/L (n = 166) in week 35. Mothers, pregnant with female fetuses (n = 77), had a significant increase in plasma leptin concentration, from 15.5 +/- 8.8 microg/L (n = 83) at 18 weeks to 18.5 +/- 10.9 microg/L (n = 80) at 35 weeks of pregnancy, whereas in mothers pregnant with male fetuses, the increase was insignificant (15.4 +/- 9.3 microg/L (n = 92) to 17.0 +/- 10.5 microg/L (n = 86). BMI increased during the same time period, from 24.2 +/- 3.3 kg/m to 27.8 +/- 3.8 kg/m (n = 174). There was a significant correlation between BMI and plasma leptin concentration at 18 weeks (r = 0.54, n = 169) and at 35 weeks (r = 0.45, n = 160), but we found no change in the relative leptin concentration (plasma leptin concentration/BMI) from week 18 to week 35. We found no significant difference between smokers and nonsmokers in plasma leptin concentration, neither at 18 nor 35 weeks of pregnancy. Gender differences in plasma leptin concentration was present already at birth in umbilical cord plasma (10.8 +/- 9.2 microg/L for girls [n = 65] vs 7.6 +/- 6.6 microg/L for boys [n = 74]). We also observed gender differences in plasma leptin concentration at 4 weeks (3.9 +/- 1.8 microg/L, n = 68 vs 3.2 +/- 1.8 microg/L, n = 71) and 14 weeks of age (4.9 +/- 2.1 microg/L, n = 61 vs 4.1 +/- 3.1 microg/L, n = 73). Plasma leptin levels at 4 and 14 weeks were lower than the level in umbilical cord plasma (n = 101). An increase in plasma leptin concentration was observed from 4 to 14 weeks of age, both for girls (n = 48) and for boys (n = 60). Leptin concentration in umbilical cord plasma correlated with birth weight (r = 0.44, n = 139), and there was significant corre

AB  - Leptin is an adipocytokine that is also synthesized by the placenta. Leptin and its receptor, which is also expressed by the placenta, are believed to play an auto- and paracrine role in trophoblast invasion and placental development. The leptin concentration in first trimester maternal serum and its relation to fetal growth disturbances were examined in this study. The study is a case-control study with 36 small-for-gestational-age (SGA) (<5th percentile) pregnancies and 108 appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) (> or =5th percentile) pregnancies. The groups were matched by maternal age, gestational age and body mass index (BMI). All were non-smokers. Leptin was measured in maternal serum in weeks 8-13 and was normalized for BMI with concentrations expressed as multiples of the median for the actual BMI. It was found that maternal serum leptin increased strongly (r = 0.7, P < 10(-4))with maternal BMI. There was no significant difference in maternal serum leptin concentrations between SGA and AGA pregnancies. In conclusion, SGA pregnancies are not associated with a lower maternal serum leptin concentration in first trimester. The maternal serum leptin concentration is largely determined by maternal BMI. Variation in the leptin concentration in maternal serum in first trimester does not seem to be associated with impaired fetal growth.

AB  - CONTEXT: Small-for-gestational-age (SGA) is an indicator of poor fetal growth "programming" an elevated risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. Little is known about early-life endocrine characteristics in SGA subtypes. Stunting (short) and wasting (skinny) are considered distinct SGA phenotypes in neonatal prognosis., OBJECTIVES: This work aimed to assess whether SGA infants with stunting or wasting have similar alterations in neonatal endocrine metabolic health biomarkers., METHODS: This was a nested case-control study based on the 3D (Design, Develop, and Discover) birth cohort in Canada. The study subjects were 146 SGA (birth weight < 10th percentile) and 155 optimal-for-gestational age (OGA, 25th-75th percentiles) infants. Stunting was defined as birth length less than the 10th percentile, and wasting as body mass index less than the 10th percentile for sex and gestational age, respectively. Main outcome measures included cord plasma concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), proinsulin, leptin, high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin, and ghrelin., RESULTS: Comparing to OGA infants adjusted for maternal and neonatal characteristics, SGA infants with either stunting only or wasting only had lower cord plasma IGF-I and leptin concentrations. HMW adiponectin concentrations were lower in SGA infants with wasting only (P = .004), but similar in SGA infants with stunting only (P = .816). Only SGA infants with both stunting and wasting had substantially lower proinsulin (P < .001) and higher ghrelin concentrations (P < .001) than OGA infants., CONCLUSION: This study is the first to demonstrate that SGA infants with wasting only are characterized by low HMW adiponectin concentrations, whereas those with stunting only are not. SGA with both stunting and wasting are characterized by low proinsulin and high ghrelin concentrations. Copyright © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Small for gestational age (SGA) infants are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes in adulthood. It is unknown whether any prenatal biomarkers are helpful for identifying SGA infants with altered metabolic health profile at birth or later life. In a nested study of 162 SGA (birth weight < 10th percentile) and 161 optimal birth weight (25th-75th percentiles) control infants in the 3D (design, develop and discover) birth cohort in Canada, we assessed whether maternal circulating placental growth factor (PlGF), a biomarker of placental function, is associated with metabolic health biomarkers in SGA infants. Main outcomes were cord plasma insulin, proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), leptin, and high-molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin concentrations. Maternal PlGF concentrations at 32-35 weeks of gestation were substantially lower in SGA versus control infants (P < 0.001), so as were cord plasma proinsulin (P = 0.005), IGF-I (P < 0.001), leptin (P < 0.001), and HMW adiponectin (P = 0.002) concentrations. In SGA infants with both low (<25th percentile) and normal maternal PlGF concentrations, cord plasma IGF-I and leptin concentrations were lower than control infants, but the decreases were to a greater extent in SGA infants with low maternal PlGF. Cord blood leptin levels were lower comparing SGA infants with low vs. normal maternal PlGF levels (P = 0.01). SGA infants with low maternal circulating PlGF levels at late gestation were characterized by greater decreases in cord blood IGF-I and leptin concentrations. Maternal circulating PlGF appears to be associated with neonatal metabolic health profile in SGA infants.

AB  - Leptin, which was identified originally as an adipocyte-derived protein, was regarded for years as an exclusive regulator of satiety and energy homeostasis. A role for leptin in pregnancy was later suggested by the findings that plasma levels during gestation are greater than in nongravid individuals and that leptin is synthesized within the fetoplacental unit. Observational studies have established that leptin production is dysregulated in several pathologic stages of pregnancy in association with alterations of fetal growth. For example, an overproduction of leptin by the placenta in pregnancy with diabetes mellitus or hypertension is associated with maternal hyperleptinemia. Evidence is also accumulating that umbilical leptin levels can be viewed as a biomarker of fetal adiposity. Ten years after its discovery as a hormone, we review the known and unknowns of leptin in pregnancy with particular emphasis on its functions in health and disease. We aim to demonstrate that studies of leptin in pregnancy largely have contributed to insight into the mechanisms of leptin action, both as a hormone and as a cytokine.

AB  - Leptin, the protein encoded by the Ob gene, is produced by the white adipose tissue and by the placenta during pregnancy. Placental leptin production makes a substantial contribution to maternal circulating levels during pregnancy which rapidly decrease and return to normal after delivery. Leptin has been detected in fetal plasma as early as week 18 of gestation, and umbilical leptin concentrations are closely related to birth weight. This has led to the hypothesis that fetal fat mass mainly determines fetal circulating leptin. Placental leptin production is increased in choriocarcinoma, preeclampsia and type 1 diabetes. Estrogens, hypoxia and insulin have been suggested as positive regulators of placental leptin production. Maternal leptinemia might act as a sensor of energy balance during pregnancy. The presence of both leptin and leptin receptors in the placenta suggests that leptin can act by autocrine or endocrine pathways in the human placenta. The roles of fetal leptin and consequences of increased placental leptin production in pathological pregnancies have yet to be elucidated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin, the protein product of the ob gene, is produced by the adipocyte and seems to function as a link between adiposity, satiety, and activity. Leptin has also been found to be necessary for pubertal development, conception, and pregnancy in mice, and is increased in prepubertal children, independent of adiposity, suggesting a role in childhood growth and development. This study investigated 100 mother/newborn pairs to determine the role of leptin in neonatal development. Placental tissue was assayed for leptin mRNA to evaluate it as a source of leptin production in utero., METHODS: One hundred mother/newborn pairs were enrolled in this study. Radioimmunoassay was performed for leptin on maternal venous and newborn cord blood. Leptin concentrations were measured in 43 children in Tanner stages 1 and 2 as a control group. Placental tissue was obtained from five mothers and assayed for leptin mRNA by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR). Human placental cell lines JAR and JEG-3 were also assayed for leptin mRNA expression., RESULTS: Leptin was present in all newborns studied at a mean concentration of 8.8 ng/mL (+/-9.6 standard deviations). Leptin concentrations in cord blood correlated with newborn weight (r = .51), body mass index (BMI) (r = .48), and arm fat (r = .42). There was no correlation between leptin and insulin. When statistically covarying for adiposity for newborns and Tanner stages 1 and 2 children, newborns had greater concentrations of leptin (mean, 10.57 ng/mL) than children (mean, 3.04 ng/mL). Leptin was present in all mothers at a mean value of 28.8 ng/mL (+/-22.2 standard deviations). Leptin concentration correlated with prepregnancy BMI (r = .56), BMI at time of delivery (r = .74), and arm fat (r = .73). Maternal leptin correlated with serum insulin (r = .49). There was no correlation between maternal and newborn leptin concentrations. Thirteen percent of newborns had higher leptin concentrations than their mothers. Placental tissue from five separate placentas expressed leptin mRNA at comparable or greater levels than adipose tissue. Two human trophoblastic placental cell lines, JAR and JEG-3, also expressed leptin mRNA., CONCLUSIONS: The correlation between leptin and adiposity found in children and adults was also found in newborns. Serum leptin concentrations in newborns were increased more than three-fold compared with children in Tanner stages 1 and 2 when controlling for adiposity, suggesting that leptin concentrations in the newborn are not explained by adiposity alone. Maternal leptin concentrations correlated with measures of adiposity at delivery but did not correlate with newborn adiposity or leptin. Leptin mRNA was expressed both in placental tissue and in two human placental cell lines. These data suggest that leptin has a role in intrauterine and neonatal development and that the placenta provides a source of leptin for the growing fetus.

AB  - We studied the impact of "IVF - ET" on the glucose tolerance test (G TT), insulin tolerance test (ITT) and adiponectin to investigate differences in the phenotypes of B6J-lrs2(-/-) mice. The B6J-lrs2(-/-) mice (KO-Nat group) were prepared by natural mating. Other mice were produced by IVF-ET used ICR strain recipients and surrogate mothers (KO-IVF group). Measurement of body weight, GTT, ITT and blood sampling were performed at the ages of 6, 14 and 24 weeks after birth. Body weights, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and plasma adiponectin concentrations did not differ for each gender between the KO-IVF and KO-Nat groups. Therefore, we concluded that phenotypes of lrs2(-/-) mice produced by reproductive technology are stable.

AB  - Vitamin D deficiency is a common finding in overweight/obese pregnant women and is associated with increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcome. Both maternal vitamin D deficiency and maternal obesity contribute to metabolic derangements in pregnancy. We aimed to assess the effects of vitamin D3 supplementation in pregnancy versus placebo on maternal and fetal lipids. Main inclusion criteria were: women <20 weeks' gestation, BMI >= 29 kg/m2. Eligible women (n = 154) were randomized to receive vitamin D3 (1600 IU/day) or placebo. Assessments were performed <20, 24-28 and 35-37 weeks and at birth. Linear regression models were used to assess effects of vitamin D on maternal and cord blood lipids. In the vitamin D group significantly higher total 25-OHD and 25-OHD3 levels were found in maternal and cord blood compared with placebo. Adjusted regression models did not reveal any differences in triglycerides, LDL-C, HDL-C, free fatty acids, ketone bodies or leptin between groups. Neonatal sum of skinfolds was comparable between the two groups, but correlated positively with cord blood 25-OH-D3 (r = 0.34, p = 0.012). Vitamin D supplementation in pregnancy increases maternal and cord blood vitamin D significantly resulting in high rates of vitamin D sufficiency. Maternal and cord blood lipid parameters were unaffected by Vitamin D3 supplementation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In our randomized controlled trial, we investigated the impact of healthy eating (HE) aiming for restricted gestational weight gain (GWG) and physical activity (PA) interventions on maternal and neonatal lipid metabolism., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Obese pregnant women (n = 436) were included before 20 weeks' gestation and underwent glucose testing (oral glucose tolerance test) and lipid profiling at baseline and 24-28 and 35-37 gestational weeks after an at least 10-h overnight fast. This secondary analysis had a factorial design with comparison of HE (n = 221) versus no HE (n = 215) and PA (n = 218) versus no PA (n = 218). Maternal changes in triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, free fatty acids (FFAs), and leptin from baseline to end of pregnancy and neonatal outcomes were analyzed using general linear models with adjustment for relevant parameters., RESULTS: At 24-28 weeks' gestation, FFAs (mean +/- SD, 0.60 +/- 0.19 vs. 0.55 +/- 0.17 mmol/L, P < 0.01) were increased after adjustment for FFA at baseline, maternal age, BMI at time of examination, gestational week, insulin resistance, self-reported food intake, self-reported physical activity, and maternal smoking, and GWG was lower (3.3 +/- 2.6 vs. 4.3 +/- 2.8 kg, P < 0.001, adjusted mean differences -1.0 [95% CI -1.5; -0.5]) in HE versus no HE. Fasting glucose levels (4.7 +/- 0.4 vs. 4.6 +/- 0.4 mmol/L, P < 0.05) and 3-beta-hydroxybutyrate (3BHB) (0.082 +/- 0.065 vs. 0.068 +/- 0.067 mmol/L, P < 0.05) were higher in HE. Significant negative associations between carbohydrate intake and FFA, 3BHB, and fasting glucose at 24-28 weeks' gestation were observed. No differences between groups were found in oral glucose tolerance test or leptin or TG levels at any time. Furthermore, in PA versus no PA, no similar changes were found. In cord blood, elevated FFA levels were found in HE after full adjustment (0.34 +/- 0.22 vs. 0.29 +/- 0.16 mmol/L, P = 0.01)., CONCLUSIONS: HE intervention was associated with reduced GWG, higher FFAs, higher 3BHB, and higher fasting glucose at 24-28 weeks of gestation, suggesting induction of lipolysis. Increased FFA was negatively associated with carbohydrate intake and was also observed in cord blood. These findings support the hypothesis that maternal antenatal dietary restriction including carbohydrates is associated with increased FFA mobilization.

AB  - We investigated the changes in the serum leptin concentration from birth to 30 days of age in order to determine the effects of leptin in early infancy. Twenty-seven Japanese term infants (12 boys and 15 girls) were examined. The serum leptin concentration at 3-6 days of age was significantly lower than that in cord blood (p < 0.0001) and was significantly higher at 30 days than at 3-6 days (p < 0.0001). The serum leptin concentration did not differ with gender or nutrition. The body weight gain and the magnitude of leptin rise that occurred between 3-6 and 30 days of age showed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.79; p < 0.0001). These changes in leptin levels suggest that leptin plays an important role in the regulation of weight gain in early infancy.

AB  - The serum leptin concentration reflects the amount of adipose tissue in the body. Although fat deposition in the fetus in the third trimester markedly increases, the role of leptin during pregnancy has not been clarified. In the present study, whether or not the serum leptin concentration correlates with growth in utero was investigated, in addition to how leptin levels change in the first few days after birth. One hundred sixteen Japanese infants were divided into term (n = 91) and preterm groups (n = 25). Term infants were divided into 3 subgroups: birth weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA) (n = 44), birth weight large for gestational age (LGA) (n = 28), and birth weight small for gestational age (SGA) (n = 19). Longitudinal changes in the concentration of serum leptin after birth were examined in 48 infants. The serum leptin concentration was determined by RIA. No significant difference in leptin levels between cord sera and infants' sera obtained within the first 6 h of life (n = 28) was observed. Within the first 6 h of life, the concentration of serum leptin in LGA infants (12.8 +/- 10.2 ng/mL) and SGA infants (1.6 +/- 1.1 ng/mL) was significantly higher and lower, respectively, than that in the AGA infants (4.4 +/- 3.0 ng/mL) (P < 0.01). A significant positive correlation was found between the leptin concentration within 6 h of life and birth body weight (r = 0.59, P < 0.01). After birth, the concentration of leptin in LGA and AGA infants significantly decreased to the level in SGA infants within 72 h [corrected] of delivery (P < 0.05). After 72 h [corrected] of life, no significant differences in the concentration of leptin were observed among the three groups, and low levels continued to 7 days of age. These findings indicate that serum level of leptin correlates with fetal body weight gain.

AB  - People in developing countries have faced multigenerational undernutrition and are currently undergoing major lifestyle changes, contributing to an epidemic of metabolic diseases, though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using a Wistar rat model of undernutrition over 50 generations, we show that Undernourished rats exhibit low birth-weight, high visceral adiposity (DXA/MRI), and insulin resistance (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps), compared to age-/gender-matched control rats. Undernourished rats also have higher circulating insulin, homocysteine, endotoxin and leptin levels, lower adiponectin, vitamin B12 and folate levels, and an 8-fold increased susceptibility to Streptozotocin-induced diabetes compared to control rats. Importantly, these metabolic abnormalities are not reversed after two generations of unrestricted access to commercial chow (nutrient recuperation). Altered epigenetic signatures in insulin-2 gene promoter region of Undernourished rats are not reversed by nutrient recuperation, and may contribute to the persistent detrimental metabolic profiles in similar multigenerational undernourished human populations.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity and may play a role in fetal and postnatal growth., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine whether early postnatal adiponectin concentration change is related to postnatal growth in very preterm infants., SETTING, DESIGN, AND PATIENTS: This was an in-hospital, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of 52 preterm infants with a gestational age (GA) of 26.0 +/- 1.9 (SD) weeks and birth weight (BW) of 889 +/- 284 g., INTERVENTIONS: An analysis of adiponectin was performed on cord blood at birth and peripheral blood at 72 hours, day 7, and then weekly until postmenstrual age (PMA) 40 weeks. Weight, length, and head circumference (HC) measurement was performed weekly and SD scores (SDS) calculated. Energy and protein intake was calculated daily from birth until PMA 35 weeks., RESULTS: Mean adiponectin concentration increased from 6.8 +/- 4.4 mug/mL at 72 hours to 37.4 +/- 22.2 mug/mL at 3 weeks; during days 3-21, it was 21.4 +/- 12 mug/mL and correlated with GA at birth (r = 0.46, P = .001; BW: r = 0.71, P < .001; BW(SDS): r = 0.42, P = .003). Furthermore, mean adiponectin during days 3-21 correlated with weight(SDS), length(SDS), and HC(SDS) (r = 0.62, 0.65, and 0.62, respectively; all P < .001) at PMA 35 wk). Energy intake (kcal/kg/d) correlated with mean adiponectin during days 3-21 (r = 0.35, P < .013)., CONCLUSIONS: In very preterm infants, adiponectin concentrations increased markedly in the first 3 weeks, and a greater increase was associated with improved postnatal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Birth by Cesarean section (C-section) may increase the risk for non-communicable diseases. We aimed to examine the relation of birth by C-section with offspring overweight and markers of cardiometabolic risk in a prospective observational cohort with 20 years of follow-up. METHODS: The Danish Fetal Origins Cohort enrolled 965 pregnant women in 1988-1989. In 2008, a follow-up study of the offspring was completed. The offspring were invited to participate in a clinical examination with measurements of anthropometry and a fasting blood sample (n = 443). In addition, 252 offspring completed a self-administered questionnaire with questions on height and weight, leaving us with a study sample of 695 offspring. Offspring overweight at 20 years was defined as body mass index (BMI). 25 kg m(-2). We also analyzed blood pressure and fasting blood samples for cardiometabolic risk factors including insulin, leptin and adiponectin, and lipid concentrations. RESULTS: In the cohort, 7% were born by C-section, and at age 20 years, 18% of the offspring had a BMI. 25 kg m-2. Birth by C-section was associated with increased odds of overweight or obesity at 20 years (Odds ratio = 2.17 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.10, 4.27)) after adjustment for potential confounders. Birth by C-section was also associated with higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol (8.5%, 95% CI: 1.1-16.5), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (12.6%, 95% CI: 1.0, 25.5), leptin (73.1%, 95% CI: 5.9, 183.1) and Apolipoprotein B (0.08 g l(-1), 95% CI: 0.04, 0.15). In contrast, birth by C-section was not related to blood pressure or serum concentrations of insulin, adiponectin, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein or Apolipoprotein A. CONCLUSION: Birth by C-section was associated with higher frequency of dysmetabolic traits in offspring independently of shared risk factors. Further research aimed at replicating these findings and elucidating the underlying biological mechanisms of this relation is needed.

AB  - Background: Premature/low-birth-weight infants are at significant risk of metabolic diseases in adulthood, which may be related to the levels of fetal adipokine. Here, we investigated the differences in the levels of umbilical cord blood adiponectin, leptin, insulin, and ghrelin in preterm and term infants and sought to elucidate the link between these hormones and fetal growth. We also evaluated the interrelationship among these metabolic hormones in both groups of newborns., Methods: A total of 149 mother-infant pairs (100 in the preterm group and 49 in the term group) were enrolled in the study. The preterm group was further subdivided according to birth weight (<=1,500, 1,501-2,000, 2,001-2,500, and >2,500 g), gestational age (<34 vs. >=34 weeks), and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) vs. small for gestational age (SGA). The general condition of the mothers and the growth parameters of the newborns at birth were recorded., Results: The levels of adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin were lower in the preterm group than those in the term group (p < 0.05). In the preterm group, the leptin levels of infants with gestational age >=34 weeks were significantly higher than those of infants with gestational age <34 weeks (mean ln leptin = 0.63 vs. 0.36 ng/ml, p = 0.009). The levels of adiponectin were lower in the SGA group than those in the AGA group (mean ln adiponectin = 2.26 vs. 2.84 microg/ml, p = 0.001), whereas those of ghrelin displayed the opposite trend (mean ln ghrelin = 6.29 vs. 5.71 pg/ml, p < 0.001). Leptin was significantly correlated with insulin both in preterm infants with birth weight (BW) >2,000 g and in term infants. Umbilical cord blood leptin was positively correlated with the BW, birth length, and head circumference of newborns (r = 0.460, 0.311, and 0.310, respectively, all p < 0.05), whereas ghrelin was negatively correlated with the same parameters (r = -0.372, -0.415, and -0.373, respectively, all p > 0.05)., Conclusions: The lack of maturation of adipose tissue and the gastrointestinal tract by the fetus due to prematurity is associated with changes in the levels of cord blood adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin. The dysregulation of these hormones in preterm infants may be a risk factor for fetal growth and future metabolic diseases. Copyright © 2021 Han, Li, Xu, Liu, Li, Li and Wang.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To understand adiponectin, leptin, insulin and ghrelin levels in preterm colostrum and mature milk and their influence on the growth and development of the premature infant., METHOD: The study subjects were divided into two groups: preterm group and control group. Specimens of colostrum and mature milk on 42nd day after delivery were collected, the general situation of maternal and infants growth parameters at birth and at postnatal 42 days were recorded. Leptin, adiponectin, insulin and ghrelin levels in colustrum and mature milk were determined and compared., RESULT: A total of 128 mother-infant pairs were involved. There were 128 specimens of colostrums (80 from preterm group, 48 from control group) and 94 specimens of mature milk(50 from premature group, 44 from control group). The levels of colostrum, mature milk adiponectin, leptin, and insulin were not significantly different between the 2 groups; ghrelin levels in colostrum and mature milk of premature group were significantly lower than those in control group (P = 0.038), adiponectin and leptin levels in colostrum were higher than those of the mature milk (P < 0.05), colostrum ghrelin levels were lower than those of mature milk (P < 0.05). Adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin showed no significant difference between different gestational age groups ( <= 34 weeks group vs. > 34 weeks group). True insulin level of mature milk in 34 weeks group was higher than that of > 34 weeks group (29.3 vs. 21.6 mU/L, P = 0.045); true insulin level in colostrums in <= 34 weeks group was lower than that in mature milk (21.7 vs. 29.3 mU/L, P = 0.000). Adiponectin levels in colostrum and 42 days weight gain were negatively correlated (r = -0.362, P = 0.025) . Insulin level in mature milk had a negative correlation with birth weight (r = -0.319, P = 0.029) . Ghrelin levels in colostrum and birth weight, length, head circumference, head circumference on 42(nd) day were positively correlated (r = 0.271,0.261,0.360, P < 0.05); weight, length at 42(nd) day and ghrelin levels showed borderline positive correlation (P = 0.050, 0.058)., CONCLUSION: Many bioactive hormones in milk might participate in the regulation of suitable growth after birth. Premature birth affects hormone levels in breast milk. Breast feeding is very important in preterm infants.

AB  - Classical gene targeting has identified many genes important for fetal and placental development. Null mutation of these genes may lead to fetal growth restriction, malformation or embryonic death. Growth restriction of epigenetic basis can predispose to adult-onset diseases. The mechanisms underlying this process, termed 'fetal programming', are beginning to be understood.

AB  - Pre-eclampsia (PE) accompanying acute liver and kidney injury has remained a master cause of both fetal and maternal mortality and morbidity. Vasoactive mediators, oxidative stress and inflammatory imbalanceshave an important role in PE pathogenesis. Apelin is an adipokine that improves endothelial dysfunction; has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects; moreover, its level reduced during PE. This study aimed to explore the effects of apelin-13 administration on preeclampsia-associated renal dysfunction and proteinuria. Thirty-three pregnant female rats were divided into three groups; group: 1 (normal pregnant rats), group: 2 (preeclamptic rats); where rats were injected subcutaneously with 75 mg L-NAME/ kg body weight/day beginning from 9th to 20th day of pregnancy and group 3 (apelin-13 treated preeclamptic rats); In which L-NAME-induced preeclamptic rats were subcutaneously injected with 6x10(-8) mol apelin-13/kg body weight/twice daily starting from 6th to 20th day of pregnancy. In all groups, mean arterial blood pressure, total urine protein, serum urea, creatinine, nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and malondialdhyde (MDA) were measured. Histopathological examination of kidney tissues was also done. preeclamptic rats showed significantly increased mean arterial blood pressure, total urine proteins, serum urea, creatinine, ET-1, IL-6, and MDA,but revealed a significantly decreased serum NO level. On the other hand, apelin treatment significantly improved these parameters together with amelioration of kidney histoarchitecture in the treated group. In conclusion, apelin may be a potentially curative candidate for prohibiting kidney damage and have a therapeutic benefit in PE rat models.

AB  - Background: Intramuscular fat (IMF) content is positively correlated with aspects of pork palatability, including flavour, juiciness and overall acceptability. The ratio of energy to protein in the finishing diet of growing pigs can impact on IMF content with consequences for pork quality. The objective of this study was to compare gene expression profiles of Musculus semimembranosus (SM) of animals divergent for IMF as a consequence of protein dietary restriction in an isocaloric diet. The animal model was derived through the imposition of low or high protein diets during the finisher stage in Duroc gilts. RNA was extracted from post mortem SM tissue, processed and hybridised to Affymetrix porcine GeneChip (R) arrays. Results: IMF content of SM muscle was increased on the low protein diet (3.60 +/- 0.38% versus 1.92 +/- 0.35%). Backfat depth was also greater in animals on the low protein diet, and average daily gain and feed conversion ratio were lower, but muscle depth, protein content and moisture content were not affected. A total of 542 annotated genes were differentially expressed (DE) between animals on low and high protein diets, with 351 down-regulated and 191 up-regulated on the low protein diet. Transcript differences were validated for a subset of DE genes by qPCR. Alterations in functions related to cell cycle, muscle growth, extracellular matrix organisation, collagen development, lipogenesis and lipolysis, were observed. Expression of adipokines including LEP, TNF alpha and HIF1 alpha were increased and the hypoxic stress response was induced. Many of the identified transcriptomic responses have also been observed in genetic and fetal programming models of differential IMF accumulation, indicating they may be robust biological indicators of IMF content. Conclusion: An extensive perturbation of overall energy metabolism in muscle occurs in response to protein restriction. A low protein diet can modulate IMF content of the SM by altering gene pathways involved in lipid biosynthesis and degradation; however this nutritional challenge negatively impacts protein synthesis pathways, with potential consequences for growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl acids are persistent compounds used in various industrial -applications. Of these compounds, perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) is currently detected in humans worldwide. A recent study on low-dose developmental exposure to PFOA in mice reported increased weight and elevated biomarkers of adiposity in postpubertal female offspring., OBJECTIVE: We examined whether the findings of increased weight in postpubertal female mice could be replicated in humans., METHODS: A prospective cohort of 665 Danish pregnant women was recruited in 1988-1989 with offspring follow-up at 20 years. PFOA was measured in serum from gestational week 30. Offspring body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference were recorded at follow-up (n = 665), and biomarkers of adiposity were quantified in a subset (n = 422) of participants., RESULTS: After adjusting for covariates, including maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, smoking, education, and birth weight, in utero exposure to PFOA was positively associated with anthropometry at 20 years in female but not male offspring. Adjusted relative risks comparing the highest with lowest quartile (median: 5.8 vs. 2.3 ng/mL) of maternal PFOA concentration were 3.1 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 6.9] for overweight or obese (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) and 3.0 (95% CI: 1.3, 6.8) for waist circumference > 88 cm among female offspring. This corresponded to estimated increases of 1.6 kg/m2 (95% CI: 0.6, 2.6) and 4.3 cm (95% CI: 1.4, 7.3) in average BMI and waist circumference, respectively. In addition, maternal PFOA concentrations were positively associated with serum insulin and leptin levels and inversely associated with adiponectin levels in female offspring. Similar associations were observed for males, although point estimates were less precise because of fewer observations. Maternal perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA), and perfluorononanoate (PFNA) concentrations were not independently associated with offspring anthropometry at 20 years., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings on the effects of low-dose developmental exposures to PFOA are in line with experimental results suggesting obesogenic effects in female offspring at 20 years of age.

AB  - Obesity is a global health problem even among pregnant women. Obesity alters quality of labor, such as preterm labor, prolonged labor, and higher oxytocin requirements in pregnant women. The most important factors to play a role in the altered gestational period and serve as drug targets to treat the consequences are female sexual hormones, calcium channels, adrenergic system, oxytocin, and prostaglandins. However, we have limited information about the impact of obesity on the pregnant uterine contractility and gestation time. Adipose tissue, which is the largest endocrine and paracrine organ, especially in obesity, is responsible for the production of adipokines and various cytokines and chemokines, and there are no reliable data available describing the relation between body mass index, glucose intolerance, and adipokines during pregnancy. Recent data suggest that the dysregulation of leptin, adiponectin, and kisspeptin during pregnancy contributes to gestational diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia. A preclinical method for obese pregnancy should be developed to clarify the action of adipokines and assess their impact in obesity. The deeper understanding of the adipokines-induced processes in obese pregnancy may be a step closer to the prevention and therapy of preterm delivery or prolonged pregnancy. Gestational weight gain is one of the factors that could influence the prenatal development, birth weight, and adiposity of newborn.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a serious condition which results in neonatal morbidity and mortality. Early prediction of HIE especially in the first six hours of birth leads to early treatment with better prognosis., AIM: The aim of this study was to compare the concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, and erythropoietin between normal neonates and those with HIE for the possible use of these markers for assessment of the degree of HIE and as markers for early prediction of HIE., PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was carried out on 50 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates with HIE born in Tanta University Hospital during the period from June 2016 to March 2018 (Group I). This study also included 50 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) normal neonates not suffering from any complications and matched with group I in age and sex as a control group (Group II). For all neonates in both groups, the following were done: Complete prenatal, natal, and postnatal history, assessment of APGAR score at 5 and 10 minutes, complete clinical examination with special account on clinical evidence of encephalopathy including hypotonia, abnormal oculomotor or pupillary movements, weak or absent suckling, apnea, hyperpnea, or seizures, measurement of cord blood gases and measurement of serum erythropoietin, leptin and adiponectin levels by ELISA immediately after birth., RESULTS: There were no significant differences between Group I and Group II regarding gestational age, male to female ratio, mode of delivery, and weight while there were significant differences regarding Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes with significantly lower Apgar score at 1 and 5 minutes in group I compared with Group II. There were significantly lower cord blood PH and adiponectin level and significantly higher cord blood Leptin and erythropoietin in group I compared with group II. There were significant differences between cord blood adiponectin, leptin, erythropoietin, and PH in different degrees of HIE with significantly lower cord blood adiponectin and PH and significantly higher cord blood leptin and erythropoietin in severe degree of hypoxia compared with moderate degree and in moderate degree compared with mild degree of hypoxia. There was a significant positive correlation between cord blood erythropoietin and leptin and a significant negative correlation between cord blood erythropoietin and both adiponectin and PH in studied neonates with hypoxia. ROC curve showed that EPO had the best sensitivity and specificity followed by leptin then adiponectin while the PH had the least sensitivity and specificity as early predictors of hypoxic neonates., CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS: Neonates with HIE had lower cord blood PH and adiponectin levels and higher leptin and erythropoietin levels than normal healthy neonates at birth and during the early postnatal period. The significant differences between cord blood erythropoietin, leptin, and adiponectin between neonates with hypoxia compared with normal neonates may arouse our attention about the use of these markers in the cord blood as early predictors of neonatal HIE which can lead early treatment and subsequently better prognosis.

AB  - Background: Previously, we demonstrated that trans fatty acid ingestion during pregnancy and lactation caused a pro-inflammatory effect on the newborn. The opposite effect was described for gestational prebiotic intake. In the present study, we examined whether supplementation of the diet of the dams with 10% of oligofructose with or without hydrogenated vegetable fat during pregnancy and lactation affected the pro-inflammatory status on the pups at age 21 days. Methods: On the first day of pregnancy, rats were divided into four groups, each of which received one of four diets: a control diet (C group), a control diet supplemented with 10% oligofructose (CF group), a diet enriched with hydrogenated vegetable fat containing trans fatty acids (T group) or a diet enriched with hydrogenated vegetable fat containing trans fatty acids supplemented with 10% oligofructose (TF group). The pups were weighed at birth and at 7, 14 and 21 days of life and were euthanized on post-natal day 21. The serum glucose, insulin and adiponectin concentrations were analyzed. The IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-alpha contents of the retroperitoneal white adipose tissue, liver, soleus and extensor digital longus muscles were analyzed by ELISA. The results are presented as the means +/- standard error of the mean. Statistical significance was assessed using two-way ANOVA, followed by Tukey's test and considered significant at p < 0.05 Results: The body weights of the 21-day old pups in the CF and TF groups were significant lower than those of the C (27% and 21%) and T (25% and 19%, respectively) groups. The serum levels of adiponectin in the CF, T and TF groups were lower than in the C group (41%; 34% and 31%, respectively). In the retroperitoneal adipose tissue, the IL-6 content was increased in TF group relative to the C and CF groups (74% for both), and the TNF-alpha content was higher in the T and TF groups than in the C group (62% and 98%, respectively). In the liver, the TNF-alpha (56% and 104%) and IL-10 (52% and 73%) contents were increased in the CF group relative to the C and TF groups. Conclusions: Supplementation of the diet of the dams with 10% of oligofructose during pregnancy and lactation, independent of supplementation with hydrogenated vegetable fat, adversely affected the development of the offspring and contributed to development of a pro-inflammatory status in the pups on postnatal day 21.

AB  - Over the past several decades, the prevalence of obesity has increased dramatically worldwide and is increasing not only in developed countries, but also in developing countries. This increase may lead to an increase in the incidence of chronic diseases throughout the lifespan. In Korean children and adolescents, the prevalence of obesity increased from 6.8% in 1998 to 10.0% in 2013. Obesity is a state that more commonly influences children and adolescents of lower socioeconomic status (SES) than those with a higher SES. However, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in a nationally representative sample of Korean adolescents decreased from 1998 to 2012. According to the Diabetes Fact Sheet of the Korean Diabetes Association, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes among children aged 18 years or younger was 153.5 per 100,000 in 2006 and 205.0 per 100,000 in 2013. Obesity is a complex disease influenced by many interacting factors, such as adipocytokines, lipopolysaccharide-binding protein, adenovirus 36 infection, birth weight, lifestyle, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals. Obesity in youth can adversely impact practically every organ system and lead to serious consequences, such as metabolic, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, cardiovascular, and psychosocial complications. Therefore, coordinated efforts by governments, organizations, communities, and individuals are needed to prevent and treat childhood obesity. In particular, a long-term policy to improve the social environment will also be necessary.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test if serum YKL-40 is increased in women developing preeclampsia or small-for-gestational age fetuses. We also assessed the association between uterine artery pulsatility index, notching and serum YKL-40 levels., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study., SETTING: A primary referral unit for obstetric ultrasound., POPULATION: A total of 1214 unselected pregnant women enrolled at nuchal translucency examination between 11(+3) and 13(+6) weeks of gestation., METHODS: All women had ultrasound and blood sample collection at the nuchal translucency scan, a 20-week malformation scan and 25-week and 32-week fetal growth examinations. Uterine artery Doppler was assessed and outcome was registered from medical records., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Preeclampsia, hypertension, small-for-gestational age., RESULTS: Serum YKL-40 was associated with increasing maternal age (p < 0.0001), body mass index (p = 0.0002), primiparity (p = 0.0003), and hypertension (p = 0.015). Serum YKL-40 increased from 12 to 20 weeks and decreased from 20-25 and 25-32 weeks of gestation. No association was found between preeclampsia and serum YKL-40. Small-for-gestational-age at birth was significantly associated with a 5.4% increase in serum YKL-40 at 32 weeks of gestation (95% CI 1.5-9.3, p = 0.005). An association was found between uterine artery pulsatility index at 32 weeks and small-for-gestational age (p = 0.0015) but not between YKL-40 and uterine artery notching (p = 0.83)., CONCLUSIONS: Serum YKL-40 was not associated with preeclampsia. Increasing serum YKL-40 was related to maternal age, body mass index and small-for-gestational age and may reflect an exaggerated inflammatory response.

AB  - Obesity and diabetes associate with neurodegeneration. Brain glucose and BDNF are fundamental in perinatal development. BDNF is related to brain health, food intake and glucose metabolism. We characterized the relationship between glycemia and/or brain glucose utilization (by 18FDG-PET during fasting and glucose loading), obesity and BDNF in 4-weeks old (pre-obese) and 12-weeks old (obese) Zucker fa/fa rats, and their age-matched fa/+ controls. In 75 human infants, we assessed cord blood BDNF and glucose levels, appetite regulating hormones, body weight and maternal factors. Young and adult fa/fa rats showed glucose intolerance and brain hyper-utilization compared to controls. Glycemia and age were positively related to brain glucose utilization, and were negative predictors of BDNF levels. In humans, fetal glycemia was dependent on maternal glycemia at term, and negatively predicted BDNF levels. Leptin levels were associated with higher body weight and lower BDNF levels. Glucose intolerance and elevated brain glucose utilization already occur in young, pre-obese rats, suggesting that they precede obesity onset in Zucker fatty rats. Glycemic elevation and brain glucose overexposure predict circulating BDNF deficiency since perinatal and early life. Future studies should evaluate whether the control of maternal and fetal glycemia during late intrauterine development can prevent these unfavorable interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin and insulin levels are key factors regulating fetal and neonatal energy homeostasis, development and growth. Both biomarkers are used as predictors of weight gain and obesity during infancy. There are currently no prediction algorithms for cord blood (UCB) hormone levels using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) that have been directly trained with anthropometric maternal and neonatal data, from neonates exposed to distinct metabolic environments during pregnancy (obese with or without gestational diabetes mellitus or lean women). The aims were: 1) to develop ANN models that simulate leptin and insulin concentrations in UCB based on maternal and neonatal data (ANN perinatal model) or from only maternal data during early gestation (ANN prenatal model); 2) To evaluate the biological relevance of each parameter (maternal and neonatal anthropometric variables)., METHODS: We collected maternal and neonatal anthropometric data (n = 49) in normoglycemic healthy lean, obese or obese with gestational diabetes mellitus women, as well as determined UCB leptin and insulin concentrations by ELISA. The ANN perinatal model consisted of an input layer of 12 variables (maternal and neonatal anthropometric and biochemical data from early gestation and at term) while the ANN prenatal model used only 6 variables (maternal anthropometric from early gestation) in the input layer. For both networks, the output layer contained 1 variable to UCB leptin or to UCB insulin concentration., RESULTS: The best architectures for the ANN perinatal models estimating leptin and insulin were 12-5-1 while for the ANN prenatal models, 6-5-1 and 6-4-1 were found for leptin and insulin, respectively. ANN models presented an excellent agreement between experimental and simulated values. Interestingly, the use of only prenatal maternal anthropometric data was sufficient to estimate UCB leptin and insulin values. Maternal BMI, weight and age as well as neonatal birth were the most influential parameters for leptin while maternal morbidity was the most significant factor for insulin prediction., CONCLUSIONS: Low error percentage and short computing time makes these ANN models interesting in a translational research setting, to be applied for the prediction of neonatal leptin and insulin values from maternal anthropometric data, and possibly the on-line estimation during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The main objective of this study was to describe the inflammatory status of adolescents with Down syndrome (DS) and their relationship with adiposity., METHODS: Ninety-five adolescents with DS (44.2% girls) and a control group of 113 adolescents (47.8% girls), aged between 11 and 18 years old, from the UP & DOWN study were included in this substudy. Serum C-reactive protein, C3 and C4 complement factors, total proteins, interleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, insulin, cortisol, leptin, adiponectin, galactin-3 and visfatin were analysed; homeostatic model assessment index was calculated. In order to evaluate adiposity, we measured the following body fat variables: weight, height, waist circumference and skinfold thicknesses. Birth weight was obtained by questionnaire. In addition, body mass index, waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and body fat percentage (BF%) were calculated., RESULTS: Down syndrome group showed higher levels of body mass index, WHtR, waist circumference, BF% and lower birth weight than controls (P < 0.001). In the general linear model in the total sample, WHtR was positively associated with C3 and C4 (P < 0.001) as well as with leptin levels (P = 0.015). BF% was positively associated with total proteins (P = 0.093) and leptin levels (P < 0.001). DS was positively associated with total proteins (P < 0.001), C3 (P = 0.047) and C4 (P = 0.019). Despite the higher levels of adiposity found in DS group, no direct association was found between BF% and leptin levels, comparing with the control group., CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that abdominal obesity should be controlled in adolescents because of its relationship with acute phase-inflammatory biomarkers but especially in DS adolescents who may show a peculiar metabolic status according to their relationship between adiposity and inflammatory biomarkers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Many different factors are involved in the pathogenesis of preterm deliveries and among them maternal or perinatal infections and inflammatory response have the major role. Researches were carried out about resistin, which is thought to have a role in inflammatory cytokine cycle and it was shown to be associated with growth in neonates. However, no research has been carried out showing its relationship with inflammation in neonates. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the resistin levels in premature neonates and the effect of events such as preterm prelabour rupture of the membranes (PPROMs) and the use of antenatal steroids on these levels., STUDY DESIGN: The study included 118 preterm neonates. Their medical data together with their mothers' were recorded. Serum resistin levels together with interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin were evaluated in the first 2 h of life., RESULT: Mean gestational age and birth weight of babies included in the study were 29.6 +/- 2.7 weeks and 1306.4 +/- 393.4 g, respectively. Babies with PPROMs had significantly higher levels of resistin ((n=30); 70.7 (7.8 to 568.4) ng ml(-1)) than babies without PPROM ((n=88); 25.9 (5.5 to 528.9) ng ml(-1)) (P=0.005), and the babies of mothers who received antenatal steroids had significantly lower resistin levels ((n=44); 20.8 (5.5 to 159.9) ng ml(-1)) than the babies of mothers who did not ((n=66); 34.6 (7.2 to 568.4) ng ml(-1)) (P=0.015). There were significant correlations between resistin and IL-6 levels and between IL-6 and procalcitonin and CRP levels in babies whose mothers did not receive antenatal steroids. However, no correlation was found between these parameters in babies whose mothers received antenatal steroids., CONCLUSION: Preterm delivery and PPROM involve complex cascade of events including inflammation, and steroids are potent anti-inflammatory agents. Elevated resistin levels in babies with PPROM and suppressed levels in babies whose mothers received antenatal steroids reported in this study might have been observed as a result of the effects of fetal inflammation on resistin levels.

AB  - This study was designed to examine the leptin levels of preeclamptic women and their offspring, to compare them with those of normal pregnant women and to search for a correlation between maternal and fetal plasma leptin levels and their anthropometric characteristics. Twenty-one preeclamptic women and their babies were enrolled into the study. Control group consisted of 21 normal pregnant women and their babies, whose birth weights, gestational ages, and genders match with those of babies born to preeclamptic women. Median maternal leptin concentrations of the preeclamptic group (15.3 ng/mL) were significantly higher ( p = 0.03) than the control group (10.4 ng/mL). However, fetal plasma leptin concentrations were not different ( p = 0.06) between the two groups. Fetal plasma leptin levels were correlated with birth weight, length, body mass index, gestational age, and fetal hematocrit levels in the control group. However, no correlation between leptin levels and these parameters was found in the preeclamptic group. Therefore, preeclampsia may be thought to disrupt normal leptin physiology.

AB  - Inadequate magnesium (Mg) intake is a widespread problem, with over 50% of women of reproductive age consuming less than the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA). Because pregnancy increases the requirement for Mg and the beneficial effects of magnesium sulfate for preeclampsia/eclampsia and fetal neuroprotection are well described, we examined the outcomes of Mg deficiency during pregnancy. Briefly, pregnant Swiss Webster mice were fed either control or Mg-deficient diets starting on gestational day (GD) 6 through euthanasia on GD17. Mg-deficient dams had significantly reduced weight gain and higher plasma adipokines, in the absence of inflammation. Livers of Mg-deficient dams had significantly higher saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) and lower polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), including docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) (P < 0.0001) and arachidonic acid (AA) (P < 0.0001). Mechanistically, Mg deficiency was accompanied by enhanced desaturase and elongase mRNA expression in maternal livers along with higher circulating insulin and glucose concentrations (P < 0.05) and increased mRNA expression of Srebf1 and Chrebp, regulators of fatty acid synthesis (P < 0.05). Fetal pups exposed to Mg deficiency were growth-restricted and exhibited reduced survival. Mg-deficient fetal livers showed lower MUFAs and higher PUFAs, with lower desaturase and elongase mRNA expression than controls. In addition, DHA concentrations were lower in Mg-deficient fetal brains (P < 0.05). These results indicate that Mg deficiency during pregnancy influences both maternal and fetal fatty acid metabolism, fetal growth and fetal survival, and support better understanding maternal Mg status before and during pregnancy.

AB  - There is a rapid increase worldwide in the prevalence of obesity in adults and children. Obesity is not only a comorbidity for chronic kidney disease (CKD) but may also be a risk factor for CKD. Epidemiological correlations and pathophysiological changes have been observed associating obesity with CKD. Low birth weight may be associated with both obesity and low nephron mass, leading to CKD later in life. Elevated levels of adipokines, such as leptin and adiponectin, in obesity may be factors in CKD pathogenesis and progression. Furthermore, various other factors, such as hypertension, increased cardiovascular morbidity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and lipotoxicity, may play significant roles in the pathogenesis of CKD in obesity. Reduction in obesity, which is a potentially modifiable risk factor, might help decrease the burden of CKD in the population. Apart from individualized options, community-based interventions have the potential to create a strong impact in this condition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although there is evidence of a positive association between asthma and obesity in adults and children, very little is known about the role of leptin in asthmatic children., OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to evaluate the relation between leptin and parameters of atopy and asthma in children., METHODS: Body mass index (BMI) and serum leptin levels were measured in 102 (37 female, 65 male; mean age, 5.9 +/- 3.4 years) asthmatic and 33 (14 female, 19 male; mean age, 6.1 +/- 3.4 years) healthy children. Skin prick tests, total serum IgE, and pulmonary function tests were performed and were completed., RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in serum leptin levels between asthmatic and healthy children. Median (interquartile range) levels were 3.53 (2.06-7.24) ng/mL and 2.26 (1.26-4.71) ng/mL, respectively (P=.008). Subgroup analysis revealed that this difference in leptin levels was confined entirely to boys: 3.09 (1.99-7.51) ng/mL in boys with asthma versus 1.52 (1.06-3.17) ng/mL in boys without asthma (P=.003). By logistic regression analysis, we found that leptin was a predictive factor for having asthma (odds ratio, 1.98; CI, 1.10-3.55; P=.021), whereas sex, age, or BMI were not. In a stepwise multiple regression analysis including sex (P=.001), age (P=.016), BMI (P <.001), and asthma (P=.022), all of these variables were found to affect log leptin levels (R2=0.404). There was no significant sex difference in serum leptin levels among asthmatic children, whereas healthy boys had significantly lower leptin levels than healthy girls (P=.019). Atopic asthmatic subjects had significantly higher leptin levels than nonatopic asthmatic subjects (P=.038) with similar BMI. A significant, but weak, correlation was observed between leptin levels and IgE in the overall group of asthmatic children (r=0.231; P=.019). Again, this correlation was confined entirely to boys (r=0.319; P=.010). There was no relation between leptin levels and skin prick tests, pulmonary function tests, passive smoking, birth weight, and duration of breast-feeding., CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that leptin may play a role in atopic asthma. High serum leptin levels in asthmatic boys may partly explain the higher prevalence of childhood asthma in male sex.

AB  - Background: Intestinal dysbiosis, or dysbacteriosis, is an abnormal interaction between the intestinal microbiota and the host cells due to altered microbial diversity. This study aimed to investigate the metabolic effects and changes in the intestinal microbiota in newborn rats following exposure to increased levels of maternal androgens in a rat model of maternal polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Material/Methods: The administration of androgen developed the rat maternal PCOS model during pregnancy. Maternal rat ovarian follicles were counting and assessed by histology. The metabolic phenotype of newborn rats was evaluated and included an insulin tolerance test, a glucose tolerance test, and measurement of serum levels of triglyceride, insulin, cholesterol, adiponectin, and leptin. Expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines was detected using quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), serum levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and proteins associated with adipose tissue remodeling and adipocyte differentiation were measured by Western blot. Results: Markers of systemic inflammation were significantly increased in the female offspring but not in the male offspring born to rat in the PCOS model. Following birth, newborn rats that received antibiotics showed an improved metabolic phenotype, with reduced serum lipid levels, insulin resistance, body weight, inflammation of adipose tissue, and serum levels of inflammatory cytokines compared with controls. Probiotics had no significant effects on these parameters in newborn rats. Conclusions: In a rat model of maternal PCOS, exposure to androgens in utero resulted in dysbiosis of the intestinal microbiota and metabolic disorders of the newborn female rats.

AB  - PURPOSE: We initiated the Genetics of Glucose regulation in Gestation and Growth (Gen3G) prospective cohort to increase our understanding of biological, environmental and genetic determinants of glucose regulation during pregnancy and their impact on fetal development., PARTICIPANTS: Between January 2010 and June 2013, we invited pregnant women aged >= 18 years old who visited the blood sampling in pregnancy clinic in Sherbrooke for their first trimester clinical blood samples: 1034 women accepted to participate in our cohort study., FINDINGS TO DATE: At first and second trimester, we collected demographics and lifestyle questionnaires, anthropometry measures (including fat and lean mass estimated using bioimpedance), blood pressure, and blood samples. At second trimester, women completed a full 75 g oral glucose tolerance test and we collected additional blood samples. At delivery, we collected cord blood and placenta samples; obstetrical and neonatal clinical data were abstracted from electronic medical records. We also collected buffy coats and extracted DNA from maternal and/or offspring samples (placenta and blood cells) to pursue genetic and epigenetic hypotheses. So far, we have found that low adiponectin and low vitamin D maternal levels in first trimester predict higher risk of developing gestational diabetes., FUTURE PLANS: We are now in the phase of prospective follow-up of mothers and offspring 3 and 5 years postdelivery to investigate the consequences of maternal dysglycaemia during pregnancy on offspring adiposity and metabolic profile., TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT01623934.

AB  - Placental lipids transfer is essential for optimal fetal development, and alterations of these mechanisms could lead to a higher risk of adverse birth outcomes. Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), LDL receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1), and scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SCARB1) genes are encoding lipoprotein receptors expressed in the placenta where they participate in cholesterol exchange from maternal to fetal circulation. The aim of this study was thus to investigate the association between maternal lipid changes occurring in pregnancy, placental DNA methylation (DNAm) variations at LDLR, LRP1, and SCARB1 gene loci, and newborn's anthropometric profile at birth. Sixty-nine normoglycemic women were followed from the first trimester of pregnancy until delivery. Placental DNAm was quantified at 43 Cytosine-phosphate-Guanines (CpGs) at LDLR, LRP1, and SCARB1 gene loci using pyrosequencing: 4 CpGs were retained for further analysis. Maternal clinical data were collected at each trimester of pregnancy. Newborns' data were collected from medical records. Statistical models included minimally newborn sex and gestational and maternal age. Maternal total cholesterol changes during pregnancy (DELTAT3-T1) were correlated with DNAm variations at LDLR (r = -0.32, p = 0.01) and LRP1 (r = 0.34, p = 0.007). DNAm at these loci was also correlated with newborns' cord blood triglyceride and leptin levels. Mediation analysis supports a causal relationship between maternal cholesterol changes, DNAm levels at LRP1 locus, and cord blood leptin concentration (pmediation = 0.02). These results suggest that LRP1 DNAm link maternal blood cholesterol changes in pregnancy and offspring adiposity at birth, which provide support for a better follow-up of blood lipids in pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of serum leptin concentrations and polymorphisms of G1019A and A223G of leptin receptor gene (LEPR) with severe pre-eclampsia. MEHTODS: A case-control study was carried out in 207 patients with severe pre-eclampsia (SPE group) and 252 healthy pregnant women (control group) during the third trimester of pregnancy. The serum leptin was determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The polymorphisms of LEPR gene G1019A and A223G were detected by polymerase chain reaction restriction-fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis. Miettinen's test was used to estimate the odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI)., RESULTS: (1) In severe pre-eclampsia group, serum leptin levels and rate of premature infant birth were significantly higher than that in normal pregnant women, and birth weight was lower than that in controls (P<0.01). (2) The frequencies of GA genotype and G allele for LEPR gene G1019A in SPE group (33.8% and 20.3%) were markedly higher than that in controls (19.8% and 15.1%) (P<0.01), and the carriers of GA genotype and G allele were more frequent in SPE group than in control group, resulting in an OR 2.04 (95%CI: 0.77-5.42) and 1.43 (95%CI: 1.02-2.01) to develop severe pre-eclampsia, compared with carriers of AA genotype and A allele. (3) AG genotype and A allele frequencies of LEPR gene A223G in SPE group (19.3% and 12.6%) were significantly lower than that in controls (34.5% and 19.2%) (P<0.01), resulting in an OR of 0.46 (95%CI: 0.30-0.71) and 0.60 (95%CI: 0.42-0.87) to develop severe pre-eclampsia, compared with subjects with GG genotype and G allele. (4) The "1019AA+223AG" genotype frequency was significantly lower in SPE group (6.8%) than in controls (24.6%) (P<0.01), resulting in an OR of 0.22 (95%CI: 0.12-0.39) to develop severe pr-eclampsia, while the "1019AA+223AG" was significantly higher in SPE group (22.2%) than in controls (11.9%) (P<0.05), resulting in an OR of 2.10 (95%CI: 0.78-3.45) to develop severe pre-eclampsia. (5) No significant differences were found in SBP, DBP, BMI and serum leptin levels in subjects with different genotypes in the two groups (P>0.05)., CONCLUSION: Elevated serum leptin level and LEPR gene G1019A and A223G polymorphisms might play a role in severe pre-eclampsia, while the level of serum leptin was not associated with genotypes of LEPR gene G1019A and A223G polymorphisms. The genotypes GA and "1019AA+223AG"of G1019A may be genetic susceptibility factors to severe pre-eclampsia.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most frequent pathophysiological state of pregnancy, which in many cases produces fetuses with macrosomia, requiring increased nutrient transport in the placenta. Recent studies by our group have demonstrated that leptin is a key hormone in placental physiology, and its expression is increased in placentas affected by GDM. However, the effect of leptin on placental nutrient transport, such as transport of glucose, amino acids, and lipids, is not fully understood. Thus, we aimed to review literature on the leptin effect involved in placental nutrient transport as well as activated leptin signaling pathways involved in the expression of placental transporters, which may contribute to an increase in placental nutrient transport in human pregnancies complicated by GDM. Leptin appears to be a relevant key hormone that regulates placental transport, and this regulation is altered in pathophysiological conditions such as gestational diabetes. Adaptations in the placental capacity to transport glucose, amino acids, and lipids may underlie both under- or overgrowth of the fetus when maternal nutrient and hormone levels are altered due to changes in maternal nutrition or metabolic disease. Implementing new strategies to modulate placental transport may improve maternal health and prove effective in normalizing fetal growth in cases of intrauterine growth restriction and fetal overgrowth. However, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - The prenatal period, during which a fully formed newborn capable of surviving outside its mother's body is built from a single cell, is critical for human development. It is also the time when the foetus is particularly vulnerable to environmental factors, which may modulate the course of its development. Both epidemiological and animal studies have shown that foetal programming of physiological systems may alter the growth and function of organs and lead to pathology in adulthood. Nutrition is a particularly important environmental factor for the pregnant mother as it affects the condition of offspring. Numerous studies have shown that an unbalanced maternal metabolic status (under- or overnutrition) may cause long-lasting physiological and behavioural alterations, resulting in metabolic disorders, such as obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Various diets are used in laboratory settings in order to induce maternal obesity and metabolic disorders, and to alter the offspring development. The most popular models are: high-fat, high-sugar, high-fat-high-sugar, and cafeteria diets. Maternal undernutrition models are also used, which results in metabolic problems in offspring. Similarly to animal data, human studies have shown the influence of mothers' diets on the development of children. There is a strong link between the maternal diet and the birth weight, metabolic state, changes in the cardiovascular and central nervous system of the offspring. The mechanisms linking impaired foetal development and adult diseases remain under discussion. Epigenetic mechanisms are believed to play a major role in prenatal programming. Additionally, sexually dimorphic effects on offspring are observed. Therefore, further research on both sexes is necessary.Copyright © 2022 Grzeda, Matuszewska, Ziarniak, Gertig-Kolasa, Krzysko- Pieczka, Skowronska and Sliwowska.

AB  - Leptin plays an important role in regulating body composition through modulation of appetite and energy expenditure. We hypothesized that leptin levels in umbilical cord blood correlate with newborn body weight and habitus. We also hypothesized that infants of diabetic mothers would demonstrate altered leptin metabolism. Venous blood was sampled at birth from the umbilical cords of 105 infants (74 infants of nondiabetic mothers, and 31 infants of diabetic mothers). Thirty-nine mothers had plasma leptin concentrations measured. Analysis was done using Student's t-test, Pearson's correlation, and Spearman's correlation. Univariate/multivariate regression was used for analysis of factors associated with leptin concentration in umbilical cord plasma. Maternal and newborn characteristics were correlated with log leptin levels in umbilical venous plasma. Leptin concentration in umbilical cord plasma correlated best with birth weight for newborns of both nondiabetic and diabetic mothers (p < 0.01 for either). Umbilical cord plasma concentration of leptin was higher in infants of diabetic mothers than in infants of nondiabetic mothers (2.53 +/- 1.09 vs. 1.76 +/- 0.82; p < 0.001). Multiple regression analysis revealed a significant (p < 0.01) relationship between umbilical cord leptin level and newborn birth weight, as well as maternal DM, but not with gestational age. Similarly, there was no significant correlation with maternal plasma leptin concentration. The strong correlation of leptin concentration in umbilical cord plasma with newborn birth weight, and the lack of significant correlation with maternal leptin plasma levels, suggest that normal fetal leptin metabolism reflects fetal size and/or body habitus independent of maternal leptin metabolism. On the other hand, the higher umbilical plasma levels in infants of diabetic mothers may reflect an influence of altered fetal insulin homeostasis on fetal leptin metabolism, and suggests that maternal diabetes may influence fetal leptin metabolism.

AB  - Leptin is secreted during pregnancy by the placenta and by the maternal and fetal adipose tissues. The leptin levels mainly reflect the amount of fat stored and thus are indicative of the energy balance, i.e., small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates represent the negative metabolic balance of in utero starved babies. We chose to compare maternal and umbilical cord leptin levels in pregnancies complicated by asymmetrical SGA versus those with appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) neonates as well as a model of multifetal growth concordant gestations in order to establish through the 'leptin link' the relative contributions of mother, fetus, and placenta to fetal weight. We found that the maternal leptin levels at delivery correlated poorly with the maternal weight gain/body mass index and with neonatal birth weight. Furthermore, the umbilical cord leptin levels correlated well with neonatal and placental weights in the AGA group but not in the SGA group. As in AGA singleton pregnancies, in multifetal uncomplicated pregnancies, the umbilical cord leptin levels correlated well with the birth weight of individuals, regardless of the status of the twin or triplet in the set. Thus, we speculated that in SGA neonates the birth weight represents the lean body weight and the low adipose tissue content (as opposed to the AGA neonates who have a substantial adipose tissue content) and, therefore, reflects mainly the basic placental contribution.

AB  - During the recent years there is a rise in prevalence of asthma and other allergic diseases. Simultaneously the number of overweight patients with increased value of body mass index (BMI) rises. It seems that although pathomechanisms of asthma and obesity are different, there is a common pathogenic link in development of these diseases. The influences of environmental, dietary, genetic and infectious factors are taken under consideration. Most epidemiological surveys confirm connection between overweight, obesity and risk of asthma at children and adults. The influence of high birth weight and higher gains of body mass during the first year of life is frequently highlighted. In contrast the risk of allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis is in negative correlation with body mass. No relation is observed between obesity and allergic dermatitis prevalence. Adipose tissue as an endocrinous organ produces number of cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. It is a source of proinflammatory factors such as: IL-6, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta, leptin, resistin. Adipocytes produce leptin which level stays in positive correlation with adipose tissue mass. Leptin can exacerbate inflammatory process and probably plays an important role in development of lungs. Higher serum level of leptin is considered as a prognostic factor of asthma evolution. Adiponectin has anti-inflammatory abilities and its level is decreased in obesity. There is a negative correlation between concentration of adiponectin and BMI. Also resistin, aP2 protein, and female sex hormones take part in development of asthma in obese patients. Influence of genetic factors is still not well known. Since now there were isolated four chromosomic regions, which had connection with higher susceptibility for both: obesity and asthma. Protective effects have dietary factors such as antioxidants and microelements. Obesity deteriorates course of the asthma, exacerbates its symptoms and coexists with other diseases such as obturative sleep apnoea or oesophageal reflux. In coexistence of obesity and asthma, apart from pharmacological treatment of patients, reduction of body mass should be strongly recommended. © Pediatr Med Rodz 2009.

AB  - The objective of this summary review is to establish the benefit of altering prenatal screening for pathological entities, such as preeclampsia and gestational diabetes. It has been determined that prenatal screening would be much more efficient in predicting high risk pregnancies for preeclampsia and GDM, (very early on, during the 11th-13th week of gestation) with the use of a medical algorithm, that includes the mother's medical history, biophysical and biochemical markers. Early detection of high risk pregnancies will allow for close monitoring and timely medical intervention, which would in turn lower the incidence of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. Regarding preeclampsia, there is the potential through the use of the medical algorithm during the 11th through 13th week of pregnancy, which includes maternal risk factors and medical history, biochemical and biophysical markers, to predict 60% to 90% of all women that will suffer from preeclampsia, early on (prior to 34 weeks gestation), intermittently (between 34 and 37 weeks gestation) and at the end of the pregnancy (beyond 37 weeks gestation), with a false positive rate of 5%. Biophysical tests include mean arterial blood pressure and measurement of uterine artery resistance via uterine artery Doppler, also biochemical tests such as low PAPP-A, low PP13, Cystatin 3 and PIFG and high fetal hemoglobin, a1 microglobulin, endoglin, activin A and inhibin A. In continuance, the algorithm for GDM is also performed between weeks 11 and 13 of pregnancy and includes maternal risk factors and medical history, biochemical and biophysical markers to predict 74% of all women that will suffer from gestational diabetes with a false positive rate of 20%. Biochemical tests include adiponectin. Visfatin, follistatin 3 FSTL-3 and SHBG. The timely prediction of risks and complications during early pregnancy (between the 11th and 13th week), will have an immense impact on the reduction of maternal and fetal mortality and morbidity and will ensure the best possible outcome for all pregnancies.

AB  - AIMS: Small for gestational age (SGA) is associated with increased rates of neonatal mortality and morbidity. Adiponectin secreted from adipose tissue is implicated in the etiology of death and illness during infancy. SGA is also a likely risk factor for the development of metabolic and clinical complications in adulthood. The present study was performed to determine whether SGA neonates and healthy controls show differences in blood adiponectin concentration at birth., METHODS: Databases were searched to identify English-language studies providing the numbers of SGA neonates, the numbers of healthy controls, and the means and standard deviations (SDs) of blood adiponectin concentrations at birth in both groups. Study quality was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). A meta-analysis was performed to summarize the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in blood adiponectin concentration between SGA neonates and healthy controls., RESULTS: The results summarized from five good quality (i.e., NOS score>=5) studies involving 253 neonates showed that blood adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in SGA neonates than in healthy controls (P=0.016), and the effect was moderate (i.e., SMD=0.4-0.7)., CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic evidence indicated that blood adiponectin concentration at birth is lower in SGA neonates than in healthy controls.

AB  - Monitoring leptin concentration in maternal blood would be useful for earlier identification of mothers at risk of delivering small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. This study was performed to examine whether maternal blood leptin concentrations are different between SGA neonates and healthy controls. Meta-analysis was performed to summarize the data of all English-language studies providing the numbers of SGA neonates, the numbers of healthy controls, and the means and standard deviations of maternal blood leptin concentrations in these two groups. The studies were collected by searching ten databases including PubMed (MEDLINE) and investigating the PubMed Related Citations and bibliographic references. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was used to assess study quality. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's test. The primary outcome of this study was the standardized mean difference (SMD) in maternal blood leptin concentration between SGA neonates and healthy controls. Thirty-two overall good-quality studies involving 1734 women and their neonates were extracted from 17 articles. Synthetic evidence did not indicate statistically significant SMD in maternal blood leptin concentration between SGA neonates and healthy controls (P = 0.172). Egger's test showed no publication bias (P = 0.309). Conclusion: Maternal blood leptin concentration is not significantly different between SGA neonates and healthy controls. What is Known: * Monitoring leptin concentration in maternal blood would be useful for earlier identification of mothers at risk of delivering small for gestational age (SGA) neonates. What is New: * The results of this meta-analysis including 1734 women and their neonates in 32 overall good-quality studies showed that maternal blood leptin concentration is not significantly different between SGA neonates and healthy controls.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adiponectin, which may have a growth-promoting effect through its insulin-sensitizing action, is thought to play a key role in fetal growth. This study was performed to determine whether maternal and/or cord blood adiponectin concentrations differ between small for gestational age (SGA) and healthy controls., METHODS: Databases were searched to identify good quality English language studies providing the number of SGA and healthy controls, and the means and standard deviations of maternal or cord blood adiponectin concentration in both groups. A meta-analysis was performed to summarize the standardized mean differences (SMDs) in maternal and cord blood adiponectin concentrations between SGA and healthy controls., RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference in maternal blood adiponectin concentration between SGA and healthy controls (n = 8, p = 0.951). However, cord blood adiponectin concentration was significantly lower in SGA than in healthy controls (n = 6, p = 0.028), and the effect was large (i.e., SMD >0.7)., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal blood adiponectin concentration is not low in SGA compared with healthy controls. However, SGA shows lower cord blood adiponectin concentration than healthy controls. Copyright © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Leptin is an important pleiotropic hormone involved in the regulation of nutrient intake and energy expenditure, and is known to influence body weight in infants and adults. High maternal levels of arsenic have been associated with reduced infant birth weight, but the mechanism of action is not yet understood. This study aimed to investigate the association between in utero arsenic exposure and infant cord blood leptin concentrations within 156 mother-infant pairs from the New Hampshire Birth Cohort Study (NHBCS) who were exposed to low to moderate levels of arsenic through well water and diet. In utero arsenic exposure was obtained from maternal second trimester urinary arsenic concentration, and plasma leptin levels were assessed through immunoassay. Results indicate that urinary arsenic species concentrations were predictive of infant cord blood leptin levels following adjustment for creatinine, infant birth weight for gestational age percentile, infant sex, maternal pregnancy-related weight gain, and maternal education level amongst 149 white mother-infant pairs in multivariate linear regression models. A doubling or 100% increase in total urinary arsenic concentration (iAs+MMA+DMA) was associated with a 10.3% (95% CI: 0.8-20.7%) increase in cord blood leptin levels. A 100% increase in either monomethylarsonic acid (MMA) or dimethylarsinic acid (DMA) was also associated with an 8.3% (95% CI: -1.0-18.6%) and 10.3% (95% CI: 1.2-20.2%) increase in cord blood leptin levels, respectively. The association between inorganic arsenic (iAs) and cord blood leptin was of similar magnitude and direction as other arsenic species (a 100% increase in iAs was associated with a 6.5% (95% CI: -3.4-17.5%) increase in cord blood leptin levels), albeit not significant. These results suggest in utero exposure to low levels of arsenic influences cord blood leptin concentration and presents a potential mechanism by which arsenic may impact early childhood growth.

AB  - Uteroplacental insufficiency (UPI) is a major cause of fetal growth restriction (FGR). Leptin, an adipokine, has been shown to play a vital role in fetal organogenesis. There is evidence reporting leptin deficiency in preterm and growth-restricted fetuses. In this issue of Pediatric Research, Yuliana et al. report leptin expression and lung development in UPI-induced FGR rats. UPI-induced FGR rats expressed decreased lung leptin and had impaired lung development, as shown by decreased surface area and lung volume. They also found a significant association between lung radial alveolar count, serum leptin, von Willebrand factor, and specific metabolites on metabolomic analyses. Previous studies on leptin supplementation in vivo have been associated with improvement in lung maturation; supporting the evidence, that leptin improves lung growth and development in FGR and may have future therapeutic potential in the improvement of respiratory outcomes in these infants. Future studies to support evidence of this association in humans are warranted. Copyright © 2024. The Author(s), under exclusive licence to the International Pediatric Research Foundation, Inc.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate leptin values in placental cord blood of newborns with normal intrauterine growth after 30-42 weeks of gestation., DESIGN: Leptin, a protein encoded by the ob gene, plays an important role in the regulation of feeding behaviour and energy balance in rodents, primates and humans. The presence of leptin in human amniotic fluid and cord blood has recently been reported in human gestations at term and the possible role of leptin in human fetal growth suggested. However, little is known of leptin synthesis during human foetal development. Thus, the aim of our work was to measure leptin (RIA, Linco Research, Inc.) in placental cord blood of human newborns at different fetal ages., PATIENTS: One hundred and twenty-six healthy newborns with normal intrauterine growth were studied. Twenty-nine were preterm (15 males and 14 females; gestational age: 30-36 weeks) and 99 were at term (49 males and 48 females; gestational age: 37-42 weeks)., RESULTS: Leptin values increase progressively throughout gestation from 1.30 +/- 0.53 ng/ml at 30 weeks of gestation to 7.98 +/- 4.96 ng/ml (mean +/- SD) at term, and correlate positively with birth weight (r = 0.56, p < 0. 005, n = 126), length (r = 0.37, p < 0.005, n = 126), BMI (r = 0.57, p < 0.005, n = 126), head circumference (r = 0.37, p < 0.005, n = 126), gestational age (r = 0.48, p < 0.005, n = 126) and placental weight (r = 0.38, p < 0.003, n = 59). Leptin values are statistically significantly lower (p < 0.005) preterm (median: 2.05 ng/ml; range: 0.7-8.3 ng/ml) than at term (median: 7.0 ng/ml; range: 1.1-28.1 ng/ml). Leptin values are also significantly (p < 0.005) higher in females (median: 7.2 ng/ml; range: 0.9-23.6 ng/ml, n = 62) than in males (median: 4.8 ng/ml; range: 0.7-28.1 ng/ml, n = 64), although there are no differences in weight (2,864 +/- 536 g in females vs. 2,937 +/- 744 g in males). Multiple regression analysis shows weight to be a positive sex-independent predictor of serum leptin values (p < 0.0005). Sex also proves to be a predictor of leptin, independently of weight and is higher in females than in males (p < 0.003)., CONCLUSION: Leptin is present in placental human cord blood after 30-42 weeks of gestation. Newborn weight and sex are independent predictors of leptin values.

AB  - The prophenoloxidase cascade in the haemolymph of mature adult Locusta migratoria migratorioides (R&F) is activated in response to injection of laminarin, a beta-1,3 glucan. Co-injection of adipokinetic hormone-I (Lom -AKH-I) and laminarin prolongs the activation of the enzyme in a dose-dependent manner. However, injections of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) do not activate prophenoloxidase unless AKH is co-injected, when there is a dose-dependent increase in the level of phenoloxidase that persists in the haemolymph for several hours. Even when AKH is co-injected, the highest levels of phenoloxidase activity are always greater after injection of laminarin than after LPS, and these two immunogens must activate the prophenoloxidase cascade by quite distinct pathways. In the present study, interactions between the endocrine and immune systems were examined with respect to activation of prophenoloxidase and the formation of nodules: injection of LPS induces nodule formation in adult locusts. With LPS from Pseudomonas aeruginosa , nodules form exclusively in dense accumulations in the anterior portion of the abdomen on either side of the dorsal blood vessel associated with the dorsal diaphragm. However, with LPS from Escherichia coli , fewer nodules are formed but with a similar distribution, except that occasionally some nodules are aligned additionally on either side of the ventral nerve cord. Co-injection of Lom -AKH-I with LPS from either bacteria stimulates greater numbers of nodules to be formed. This effect of coinjection of AKH on nodule formation is seen at low doses of hormone with only 0.3 or 0.4 pmol of Lom -AKH-1, respectively, increasing the number of nodules by 50%. Injections of octopamine or 5-hydroxytryptamine do not mimic either of the actions of Lom -AKH-I described here. Co-injection of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, reduces nodule formation in response to injections of LPS but has no effect on the activation of phenoloxidase. Co-injection of an inhibitor of eicosanoid synthesis, dexamethasone, with LPS influences nodule formation (with or without AKH) in different ways according to the dose of dexamethasone used, but does not affect activation of prophenoloxidase. Eicosanoid synthesis is important for nodule formation, but not for the activation of the prophenoloxidase cascade in locust haemolymph.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to compare maternal blood and umbilical-cord leptin, spexin and visfatin levels during delivery in severe preeclampsia (PE) with controls, and to evaluate whether any clinical or demographic variables had independent associations with them. Methods This is a case-controlled observational study consisting of 45 pregnant women with severe PE and a control group consisting of gestational age-matched 45 healthy pregnant women. We examined the leptin, spexin, and visfatin levels in serum samples taken from maternal blood and umbilical cords during cesarean section in both groups. Leptin, spexin, and visfatin levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results The maternal leptin and visfatin levels were significantly higher and the maternal spexin levels were significantly lower in the PE group than in the control group (p < 0.001). Similar to the maternal adipokine levels, the umbilical-cord leptin and visfatin levels were significantly higher and the spexin levels were significantly lower in the PE group (p < 0.001). We found a significant positive correlation between maternal body mass index and maternal blood and umbilical-cord serum leptin and visfatin levels in both groups (p < 0.001). Conclusion The leptin, spexin and visfatin levels were significantly altered in the nondiabetic preeclamptic women in our study. We believe that the main reason for these changes may be the hypoxic placenta to protect the fetus and maintain its nutrition.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Various studies have demonstrated an increased risk for adult diseases in newborns born small-for-gestational-age (SGA). Adiponectin and resistin can be detected in cord blood and are suggested to affect insulin resistance (IR). This might represent a link between metabolic syndrome and SGA birth., STUDY DESIGN: We investigated the relationship between the adipocytokines and inter-twin birth weight (BW) difference of 31 monozygotic twins with twin-twin transfusion syndrome; in 14 twin pairs BW difference was >15% (1 SGA twin, 1 appropriate-for-gestational-age, AGA, twin)., RESULTS: BW and length of all patients were positively related to adiponectin (r = 0.57; p < 0.0001; r = 0.47; p < 0.0001) and to resistin (r = 0.31; p < 0.01; r = 0.35; p < 0.01). In 71% (10/14), the SGA twins showed lower adiponectin concentrations than their AGA co-twins (only 6/14 for resistin). To correct for gestational age we calculated the relationship between the intrapair differences (Delta) of BW and Delta of the hormones. We found Delta BW positively correlated with adiponectin (r = 0.55; p < 0.001) but not with resistin (r = 0.22; p = 0.2). Delta adiponectin was positively correlated with Delta resistin (r = 0.45; p < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that adiponectin and resistin levels are associated with BW with only adiponectin levels being reduced in SGA children independently of gestational age. Prenatally different metabolic status between the twins might predispose the SGA twin to develop IR later in life. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate a potential role of leptin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I on fetal growth and metabolic function we determined plasma leptin and IGF-I concentrations in twins in relation to discordant fetal growth., STUDY DESIGN: In studying monochorionic twins with inter-twin birth weight difference, we investigated the relative contribution of genetic (fetus) versus environmental (maternal/placental) factors on growth. Thirty-six sets of twins (14 with discordant growth, birth weight difference >15%) who had been treated for severe twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) by laser coagulation were studied. Cord blood samples were collected at birth and analyzed for IGF-I and leptin. Inter-twin differences (delta) of birth weight and head circumference were correlated to delta hormone levels., RESULTS: An inter-twin correlation for leptin (r = 0.69; p <0.0001) and delta IGF-I (r = 0.49; p <0.0001) was found. delta birth weight correlated significantly with delta IGF-I (r = 0.67; p <0.0001) but not with delta leptin (r = 0.23; p = 0.19). delta IGF-I concentrations did not correlate with delta leptin (r = 0.18). delta head circumference correlated significantly with delta leptin (r = 0.47; p <0.01) and with delta IGF-I (r = 0.46; p <0.01). Using a multiple regression model with head circumference as dependent variable, adjusted for gestational age, head circumference remained significantly associated with higher leptin concentrations in all patients (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSION: IGF-I is a good indicator for fetal growth and brain development. Leptin seems to be mainly genetically determined but may play a role in fetal brain development and is not only an index for fetal fat mass.

AB  - Hirsutism is a common endocrine disorder, defined as increased growth of terminal hairs in a male pattern. Hirsutism is most often caused by polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), whereas only 5% patients are diagnosed with rare endocrine diseases. PCOS may be considered a multiorgan disease causing not only increased adrenal and ovarian sex hormone secretion but also changed secretion of gonadotrophins, growth hormone, and adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) from the pituitary. The majority of patients with PCOS are insulin resistant and PCOS is characterized by an increased inflammatory state with abdominal obesity and increased secretion of interleukins, chemokines, and adipokines. PCOS is therefore associated with an increased risk of the metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Patients with hirsutism present with increased bone mineral density despite decreased D-vitamin levels. The etiology to hirsutism and PCOS is most likely multifactorial including both genetic and environmental factors such as increased fetal stress and intrauterine growth retardation. In the present review, we give a comprehensive overview of the pathophysiology and multiple endocrine disturbances of hirsutism and PCOS.

AB  - Context/ObjectiveTo identify cardiometabolic (CM) measurements that cluster to confer increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk using principal component analysis (PCA) in a cohort of chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) and healthy non-SCI individuals.ApproachA cross-sectional study was performed in ninety-eight non-ambulatory men with chronic SCI and fifty-one healthy non-SCI individuals (ambulatory comparison group). Fasting blood samples were obtained for the following CM biomarkers: lipid, lipoprotein particle, fasting glucose and insulin concentrations, leptin, adiponectin, and markers of inflammation. Total and central adiposity [total body fat (TBF) percent and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) percent, respectively] were obtained by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA). A PCA was used to identify the CM outcome measurements that cluster to confer CVD risk in SCI and non-SCI cohorts.ResultsUsing PCA, six factor-components (FC) were extracted, explaining 77% and 82% of the total variance in the SCI and non-SCI cohorts, respectively. In both groups, FC-1 was primarily composed of lipoprotein particle concentration variables. TBF and VAT were included in FC-2 in the SCI group, but not the non-SCI group. In the SCI cohort, logistic regression analysis results revealed that for every unit increase in the FC-1 standardized score generated from the statistical software during the PCA, there is a 216% increased risk of MetS (P = 0.001), a 209% increased risk of a 10-yr. FRS & GE; 10% (P = 0.001), and a 92% increase in the risk of HOMA2-IR & GE; 2.05 (P = 0.01).ConclusionApplication of PCA identified 6-FC models for the SCI and non-SCI groups. The clustering of variables into the respective models varied considerably between the cohorts, indicating that CM outcomes may play a differential role on their conferring CVD-risk in individuals with chronic SCI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the insulin resistance status in SGA infants at 12 months and its relationship with auxological and metabolic parameters., METHODS: One group of 45 SGA and one of 50 appropriate for gestational age infants were followed from birth to the end of the first year of life. At 12 months, skinfold thickness, waist circumference, and blood levels of glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin, resistin, visfatin, retinol-binding protein 4, IGFs, lipids profile were determined, and the HOMA-IR index was calculated., RESULTS: The SGAs had increased insulin (5.2 +/- 2.7 versus 2.9 +/- 2.4 muIU/ml, p = 0.012) and HOMA-IR (1.09 +/- 0.9 versus 0.59 +/- 0.55, p = 0.016). In multiple regression, insulin resistance indices were independently correlated with low-birth-weight (beta = -2.92, p = 0.015 for insulin, beta = -2.98, p = 0.011 for HOMA-IR) but not with catch-up growth in either height or weight or any other metabolic parameter. Resistin was higher in the SGAs (5.1 +/- 2.1 versus 3.9 +/- 2.1 ng/ml, p = 0.03) and independently correlated with low-birth-weight but not insulin resistance. Resistin was negatively correlated with total cholesterol (R = -0.33, p = 0.007) and positively with lipoprotein(a) (R = 0.49, p = 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Low-birth-weight, but not catch-up growth or adiposity tissue hormones, was correlated with insulin resistance at 12 months in non-obese SGA infants. The higher resistin in SGA infants and its correlation with total cholesterol and lipoprotein(a) need further clarification.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Low vitamin D [25(OH)D] levels have been associated with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Children born large for gestational age (LGA) may exhibit increased indices of insulin resistance early in life., OBJECTIVE: This study aims to prospectively examine serum 25(OH)D and parathormone (iPTH) levels in LGA and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) prepubertal children, in relation to the severity of macrosomia and insulin resistance., METHODS: Children were examined at age 5-7.5 years, 38 born LGA and 39 AGA, matched for age, gender, body weight, height and body mass index (BMI). Twenty-one LGA had birth weights in the 90th-97th percentile and 17 >97th percentile. Fasting serum levels of glucose, insulin, 25(OH)D, and iPTH were measured. The homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was estimated., RESULTS: The insulin resistance indices were higher in the LGA >97th percentile subgroup than in the AGA group: HOMA-IR 1.53+/-0.66 vs. 1.04+/-0.53 and fasting insulin 6.92+/-3.1 vs. 4.78+/-2.2 muIU/mL (but similar to the AGA group), and in the LGA 90th-97th percentile subgroup: HOMA-IR 1.17+/-0.61 and insulin 5.53+/-2.2. There was no difference in 25(OH)D among the three subgroups. The iPTH was higher in the LGA >97th percentile subgroup than in the AGA group (26.8+/-7.6 and 22.6+/-7.2 pg/mL, respectively, p<0.05), although it was not correlated with insulin resistance indices. Birth weight was correlated negatively with fasting insulin and HOMA-IR in the entire cohort, independent of age, sex, waist circumference, and BMI (beta=0.37, p<0.01 and beta=0.30, p<0.05, respectively), while waist circumference was positively correlated with HOMA-IR (R=0.40, p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: Birth weight and current body composition appear to affect glucose homeostasis in LGA prepubertal children, while the serum levels of 25(OH)D and iPTH appear to be uninvolved.

AB  - Children born small (SGA) or large (LGA) for gestational age are prone to develop insulin resistance (IR) during childhood. Visfatin, a hormone with insulin-mimetic actions, has been associated with IR. This study was designed to examine whether serum level of visfatin is correlated with metabolic indices of IR, in prepuberty in association with the intrauterine growth pattern. The following parameters were evaluated at a mean age of 6.5+/-1.2 years in 155 prepubertal children born appropriate for the gestational age (AGA) (n=63), or SGA (n=42), or LGA (n=50): serum levels of visfatin, adiponectin, leptin, fasting glucose (G(F)) and insulin (I(F)), the homeostasis model assessment IR index (HOMA-IR), plasma lipids, anthropometric indices at birth and the time of evaluation, and obesity indices [waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI) and skinfold thickness]. The mean serum level of visfatin was lower in the SGA than in the AGA and the LGA children (9+/-5.2 vs. 11.8+/-5.1 and 12.7+/-5.6 ng/ml, respectively, p<0.01). Girls had lower visfatin levels than boys (10.4+/-4.3 ng/ml vs. 12.5+/-6.7 ng/ml, p<0.05). Visfatin was not correlated with IR indices. In multiple regression analysis visfatin level was positively correlated with birth weight z-score (t=2.56, beta=0.24, p<0.01) and crown to heel z-score (t=2.46, beta=0.22, p=0.014), independent of age, gender, maternal weight before pregnancy, maternal weight gain during pregnancy, BMI z-score, WC z-score, serum leptin and adiponectin, and HOMA-IR. In conclusion serum visfatin level was lower in prepubertal SGA children but not correlated with IR indices. Low birth weight was an independent predictor of visfatin level.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Children born large for gestational age (LGA) are prone to develop insulin resistance later in life. One factor that affects insulin sensitivity is the hormone adiponectin. The aim of this study was to determine whether being LGA has an impact on serum adiponectin and leptin levels and insulin resistance parameters during childhood, taking into account the severity of overweight., STUDY DESIGN: Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, fasting glucose and insulin, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), and anthropometric indices were evaluated in groups of non-obese children aged 6.5-8 years, born appropriate for gestational age (AGA, n = 40) or LGA (n = 41), matched for age, gender, height, weight and body mass index. The LGA group was divided in two subgroups according to the degree of overweight: (a) LGA with birthweight 90th-97th percentile (n = 25); and (b) LGA with birthweight > 97th percentile (n = 16)., RESULTS: LGA children had a higher mean serum adiponectin level than AGA children: 17.0 +/- 9 vs. 11.1 +/- 5 (microg/ml) (P < 0.01). LGA children had also higher insulin 6.2 +/- 2.8 vs. 4.8 +/- 2.4 (microU/ml) (P < 0.05) and HOMA-IR 1.32 +/- 0.66 vs. 1.02 +/- 0.55 (P < 0.01) than AGA children. Children born LGA > 97th percentile had a significantly higher mean serum leptin level than both AGA and LGA 90th-97th percentile children (17 +/- 13, 9.6 +/- 9.5, 7.8 +/- 7.9 ng/ml, respectively, P < 0.05), and more severely affected insulin resistance indices than LGA 90th-97th percentile children. In the regression analysis, birthweight was found to be an independent predictor of adiponectin serum levels., CONCLUSION: Prepubertal LGA-born children had a higher mean serum adiponectin levels than matched AGA controls despite the fact that they were more insulin resistant. The degree of excess in utero weight gain appears to influence the metabolic profile in LGA-born prepubertal children. Further studies are needed to delineate the role of adiponectin in the risk of development of insulin resistance in children born LGA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) is an adipocyte-derived 'signal' that may contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. The relationship of RBP4 with insulin resistance and metabolic risk in human beings has been the subject of several studies. Subjects born small for gestational age (SGA) are at risk of insulin resistance and Type 2 diabetes. Though RBP4 could represent an early marker of insulin resistance, to date, none have determined RBP4 in SGA children., AIM: Our aim was to measure RBP4 concentrations in cord blood of SGA newborns compared with those in children born with a birth weight appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and to determine whether serum RBP4 levels at birth correlate with insulin sensitivity markers., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-four newborns, 17 born SGA (mean gestational age: 36.4+/-2.1 weeks), and 47 born AGA (mean gestational age: 37.0+/-3.6 weeks) were studied. The main outcome measures included anthropometry, lipid profile, insulin, homeostasis model assessment, quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index, adiponectin, and RBP4., RESULTS: RBP4 concentrations were significantly reduced in SGA newborns (p<0.002). No relationship was found between RBP4 and insulin sensitivity parameters. Stepwise regression analysis revealed that birth weight was the major predictor of RBP4 serum concentrations (p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: RBP4 is reduced in SGA newborns, birth weight representing the major determinant of RBP4 concentrations, and is not related to insulin sensitivity. No significant difference in adiponectin levels and insulin sensitivity markers was found between SGA and AGA neonates.

AB  - Vitamin B12 deficiency is widely prevalent in women of childbearing age, especially in developing countries. In the present study, through dietary restriction, we have established mouse models of severe and moderate vitamin B12 deficiencies to elucidate the impact on body composition, biochemical parameters, and reproductive performance. Female weanling C57BL/6 mice were fed for 4 weeks: (a) control AIN-76A diet, (b) vitamin B12-restricted AIN-76A diet with pectin as dietary fiber (severe deficiency group, as pectin inhibits vitamin B12 absorption), or (c) vitamin B12-restricted AIN-76A diet with cellulose as dietary fiber (moderate deficiency group as cellulose does not interfere with vitamin B12 absorption). After confirming deficiency, the mice were mated with male colony mice and maintained on their respective diets throughout pregnancy, lactation, and thereafter till 12 weeks. Severe vitamin B12 deficiency increased body fat% significantly, induced adiposity and altered lipid profile. Pregnant dams of both the deficient groups developed anemia. Severe vitamin B12 deficiency decreased the percentage of conception and litter size, pups were small-for-gestational-age and had significantly lower body weight at birth as well as weaning. Most of the offspring born to severely deficient dams died within 24 h of birth. Stress markers and adipocytokines were elevated in severe deficiency with concomitant decrease in antioxidant defense. The results show that severe but not moderate vitamin B12 restriction had profound impact on the physiology of C57BL/6 mice. Oxidative and corticosteroid stress, inflammation and poor antioxidant defense seem to be the probable underlying mechanisms mediating the deleterious effects.

AB  - Children born small for gestational age are at high risk of developing insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension and cardiovascular disease in adulthood. In addition, approximately 10% of SGA children do not achieve a normal adult height. Studies performed in SGA children to evaluate markers of metabolic disease in prepubertal, pubertal and adolescent subjects, indicate a higher prevalence of subtle endocrine and metabolic abnormalities that may precede the onset of overt disease in adulthood. At present, however, there are no conclusive data supporting the need of systematic close monitoring of GH-IGF, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal and hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axes, as well as insulin sensitivity, glucose homeostasis, and lipid metabolism. Monitoring of metabolic parameters should probably be reserved to SGA children with genetic predisposition to type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia, as early identification of metabolic alterations might prompt effective preventive interventions and, ultimately, reduce cardiovascular risk.

AB  - Introduction. Adiponectin, resistin and osteoprotegerin (OPG) are cytokines expressed in the adipose tissue. Pregnancy is associated with gradually increased maternal levels of these molecules, also detected in significant amounts in umbilical cord blood serum samples. Aim, patients and methods. In establish the relationships of maternal and umbilical adiponectin, resistin and OPG levels to both maternal and fetal anthropometric measurements and insulin sensitivity, 28 mother-newborn pairs were enrolled in the study. Blood samples were collected in a fasting state, after delivery, and serum insulin. C-peptide, sex hormone-binding globulin, adipocytokines, OPG and bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) were measured. Results. Compared to maternal values, umbilical scrum adiponectin levels were about 3-fold higher; additionally, significantly higher resistin and lower OPG levels were observed. Stratification of umbilical and maternal adiponectin levels according to tertiles of birth body weight demonstrated significantly lower maternal adiponectin levels by tertiles of neonatal body weight. No relationships were noticed between infant birth weight and maternal or umbilical scrum resistin and OPG, respectively. Umbilical resistin was significantly associated to both maternal resistin and umbilical adiponectin. Multiple regression analysis showed that maternal BNI, umbilical insulin, C-peptide and resistin explained 71.83% of umbilical serum adiponectin variability. Umbilical resistin was independently predicted by umbilical adiponectin, umbilical C-peptide and maternal BNI, and the model explained 81.49% of umbilical resistin levels. Conclusions. In human, umbilical scrum adiponectin and resistin levels are significantly higher compared to adults. These adipokines may mediate the effects of maternal body mass on fetal development. The biology of the OPG/RANKL cytokine system in fetuses and newborns needs further research.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content may be associated with clinical features, anthropometric variables, and laboratory findings in both extremes of abnormal fetal growth: small and large size for gestational age., RESEARCH METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Eighty-eight pregnant women and their infants were included in a cross-sectional study. According to the offspring birthweight, normalized by sex and gestational age, there were 57 newborns with appropriate weight for gestational age (AGA) and 31 with abnormal weight for gestational age: 17 small for gestational age (SGA) and 14 large for gestational age (LGA). mtDNA quantification using nuclear DNA as a reference was measured by a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction method., RESULTS: The mothers' pregestational BMI was associated with the weight of their offspring: SGA infants had lean mothers (BMI, 21.4 +/- 0.7), and LGA infants had overweight mothers (BMI, 26.7 +/- 1.4) in comparison with AGA infants (BMI, 23.0 +/- 0.7) (p < 0.003). Newborn leptin levels were associated with birthweight after adjustment for sex and gestational age (SGA, 7.0 +/- 1.1 ng/mL; AGA, 15.2 +/- 1.6 ng/mL; and LGA, 25.6 +/- 4.1 ng/mL) (p < 0.002). Conversely, mtDNA/nuclear DNA ratio was significantly lower in both extremes of abnormal fetal growth, SGA (18 +/- 6) and LGA (9 +/- 2), at birth in comparison to AGA-weight infants (28 +/- 4) (p < 0.03)., DISCUSSION: Our findings show that mtDNA content is decreased in newborns with abnormal weight in comparison with AGA infants. On the basis of a cumulative body of evidence, we speculate that mtDNA depletion is one of the putative links between abnormal fetal growth and metabolic and cardiovascular complications in later life.

AB  - Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is the most common metabolic disorder in pregnant women, defined as any degree of glucose intolerance with onset or first detected during pregnancy. Explanation of its pathogenesis is extremely important due to the possibility of preventing serious maternal and fetal complications. The aim of the study was to evaluate the concentrations of two molecules: C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein-3 (CTRP-3) and pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) which may possibly participate in GDM development. To our knowledge, this is the first study in pregnant women with GDM evaluating CTRP-3 level. Methods: Serum CTRP-3 and PEDF concentration and clinical characteristics were detected in 172 pregnant women. These women were divided into two groups: normal glucose tolerance group (NGT,n= 54) and gestational diabetes mellitus group (GDM,n= 118). This second group was further divided into two subgroups depending on the treatment used: GDM 1-diet only (n= 75) and GDM 2-insulin treatment (n= 43). Results: Our study did not reveal any statistically significant difference between the concentration of PEDF in the control and GDM group. In our study there was a significantly higher concentration of CTRP-3 evaluated in the peripheral blood serum in patients with gestational diabetes (GDM) compared to those in the control group (8.84 vs. 4.79 ng/mL). Significantly higher values of CTRP-3 were observed in both the diet-treated subgroup and the group with insulin therapy when compared to control group (8.40 and 10.96, respectively vs. 4.79 ng/mL). Conclusion: PEDF concentration does not change in GDM, whereas an increased level of CTRP-3 may point to the key role of this adipokine in the development of GDM.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Serum leptin concentrations reflect the fat mass of an individual. Fetal growth is rapid and it might be expected that major changes in circulating leptin concentrations in the fetus and neonate take place. We have studied the ontogeny of serum leptin concentrations in cord blood samples obtained by cordocentesis between 14 and 32 weeks of gestation and in samples obtained at term., PATIENTS: Cordocentesis samples from 10 appropriately grown for gestational age (AGA) and 10 intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetuses. The results were compared with cord serum leptin concentrations obtained in 39 term healthy pregnancies., RESULTS: In the AGA and term pregnancies serum leptin concentrations changed little up until 38 weeks of gestation when there was an increase in concentration (Pre 38 weeks 3.5 microg/l (SEM 0.3); Post 38 weeks 5. 6 microg/l (SEM 0.7): Mann Whitney P = 0.03). Serum leptin concentrations were similar in the AGA and IUGR fetuses (AGA 5.9 microg/l (SEM 3.0); IUGR 4.2 microg/l (SEM 1.5): Mann-Whitney P = ns). Serum leptin was strongly related to birth weight (r = 0.58; P < 0.001) and birth length (r = 0.32; P = 0.05) in the term babies but not in the AGA or IUGR groups., CONCLUSION: Serum leptin concentrations in the fetus appear to be independent of gestational age and only rise towards the end of gestation. This late change probably reflects the changes in the accretion of body fat. There appears to be little difference in serum leptin concentrations between AGA and IUGR fetuses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine 1. the relationship between maternal serum leptin concentrations and maternal anthropometry and 2. the relationship between cord serum leptin concentrations at birth and neonatal anthropometry., DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of fetal growth in low-risk pregnancies., SETTING: University teaching hospital., SAMPLE: Thirty-nine women and their babies taking part in a fetal growth study., METHODS: Blood was taken from the women between 10-20 weeks of gestation and from the umbilical cord of their babies at delivery. Serum leptin was measured by radio-immunoassay. Maternal anthropometric measurements were recorded at booking. Neonatal anthropometric measurements were recorded within 48 hours after delivery. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between serum leptin concentrations and anthropometric measures and multiple regression analysis then applied to determine which variables remained independently associated with leptin., RESULTS: The median (range) leptin concentration in maternal serum was 11.8 ng/mL (1.7-39.7) and in cord blood was 4.2 ng/mL (0.6-21.4). Maternal leptin levels correlated with maternal weight, body mass index, midarm circumference and skinfold thickness, but not with birthweight, placental weight or maternal height. Body mass index and midarm circumference remained significant after multiple regression analysis. Cord leptin levels correlated with birthweight, birthlength, placental weight and skinfold thickness but not with ponderal index. Birthweight and subscapular skinfold thickness remained significant after multiple regression analysis. Cord leptin concentrations did not correlate with maternal leptin concentrations., CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that there are very strong associations between maternal leptin and maternal adiposity in pregnancy, and between cord leptin at delivery and birthweight, as well as other anthropometric markers of fetal growth.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) reduces maternal adiponectin and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) materno-fetal transfer, which may have negative consequences for the offspring. Our aim was to evaluate the effects of the adminis tration of a novel adiponectin agonist (AdipoRon) to GDM rats on the long-term consequences in glycaemia and fatty acids (FA) profile in the offspring. Pregnant rats were randomized to three groups: GDM rats (GDM, n = 8), GDM rats treated with AdipoRon (GDM + ADI, n = 9), and control rats (n = 10). Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (50 mg/kg) on da y 12 of gestation. GDM+ADI received 50 mg/kg/day AdipoRon from da y 14 until delivery. Glycaemia and FA profile were determined in mothers and adult offspring (12 weeks old). AdipoRon tended to reduce fasting glucose in diabetic mothers. Diabetic rats presented the foetus with intrauterine growth restriction and higher adiposity, which tried to be counteracted by AdipoRon. In the adult offspring, both GDM + ADI and control animals showed better glucose recovery after oral glucose overload with respect to GDM. DHA in offspring plasma was significantly reduced in both GDM and GDM + ADI compared to controls (P = 0.043). Nevertheless, n- 6/n-3 polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) ratio improved in plasma of GDM + ADI adult offspring (GDM: 14.83 +/- 0.85a%; GDM + ADI: 11.49 +/- 0.58b%; control: 10.03 +/- 1.22b%, P = 0.034). Inflammatory markers and oxidative stress were reduced in the adult offspring of AdipoRon-treated mothers. In c onclusion, AdipoRon administration to pregnant diabetic rats improved glycaemia in the mothers and longterm glucose tolerance in the offspring. In addition, it tended to reduce excessive foetal fat accumulation and improved n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio signific antly in offspring at the adult state.

AB  - Chronic intermittent hypoxia (CIH) occurs frequently in premature infants who have apnea of prematurity. Immaturity of the respiratory network from low central respiratory drive and the greater contribution of the carotid body on baseline breathing leads to respiratory instability in premature infants presenting as apnea and periodic breathing. During the 2nd week after birth, the smallest and the youngest premature infants have increased frequency of apnea and periodic breathing and associated oxygen desaturations that can persist for weeks after birth. CIH increases the production of reactive oxygen species that causes tissue damage. Premature infants have decreased capacity to scavenge reactive oxygen species. Oxidative injury is the cause of many of the co-morbidities that are seen in premature infants. In this review we discuss who low fat mass and the resulting relative deficiencies in leptin and adiponectin could contribute to the increase frequency of oxygen desaturations that occurs days after birth in the smallest and youngest premature infants. Leptin is a central respiratory stimulant and adiponectin protects the lung from vascular leak, oxidative injury and vascular remodeling. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Adipose tissue produces leptin, which is pro-inflammatory, and adiponectin, which has anti-inflammatory properties. Participants with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) have increased body fat and are at increased risk for respiratory illness. Objective: To assess the associations between leptin and adiponectin with pulmonary function in a chronic SCI cohort. Design: Cross-sectional study. Setting: Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Participants: A total of 285 participants (237 men and 48 women) with chronic SCI with mean (standard deviation) injury duration 17.8 (13.2) years from the VA Boston and the community participating in an epidemiologic study assessing factors associated with respiratory health. Methods: Participants (24.6% cervical American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) level A, B, and C; 33.6% other AIS A, B, and C; 41.8% AIS D) provided a blood sample, completed a respiratory health questionnaire, and underwent spirometry. Linear regression methods were used to assess cross-sectional associations between plasma leptin and adiponectin with spirometric measures of pulmonary function adjusted for age, race, gender, and height. Level and severity of SCI, mobility mode, body mass index, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, chest injury history, laboratory batch, and other potential confounders were also considered. Main Outcome Measurements: forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and FEV1/FVC. Results: There was a statistically significant inverse relationship between plasma leptin assessed in quartiles or as a continuous covariate with FEV1 and FVC. In fully adjusted models, each interquartile range (16,214 pg/mL) increase in leptin was associated with a significant decrease in FEV1 (-93.1 mL; 95% confidence interval = -166.2, -20.0) and decrease in FVC (-130.7 mL; 95% confidence interval = -219.4, -42.0). There were no significant associations between leptin and FEV1/FVC or between plasma adiponectin with FEV1, FVC, or FEV1/FVC. Conclusion: Plasma leptin in individuals with chronic SCI is inversely associated with FEV1 and FVC, independently of SCI level and severity and other covariates. This finding suggests that plasma leptin may contribute to reduced pulmonary function in chronic SCI.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the dynamical interplay between perinatal leptin concentrations and neonatal weight evolution until 3 months of age., METHODS: In a prospective observational study, maternal, cord blood and neonatal plasma leptin concentrations were correlated to birthweight and 3-month weight in 26 full-term, 20 preterm, and 17 intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) mother-neonate couples., RESULTS: The median of maternal, cord blood, neonatal leptin concentrations were significantly different among the three groups (p = 0.010; <0.001; =0.041 correspondingly). In the respect of the full-term group, higher concentrations were reported in preterm and IUGR mothers and lower concentrations in cord blood and neonatal plasma. The post-hoc comparisons showed that maternal concentrations were significantly higher in the IUGR group (p = 0.005 vs full-term), cord blood concentrations resulted always significantly lower (preterm, IUGR vs full-term p < 0.001) and neonatal concentrations were significantly lower in the preterm group (p = 0.018 vs full-term). Neonatal birthweight and 3-month weight were always significantly different among groups (p < 0.001), even if preterm and IUGR still had lower weight than full-term, the percent increasing of weight between birth and 3-month demonstrated that preterm and IUGR infants have grown significantly faster, (preterm, IUGR vs full-term p < 0.001). The univariable analysis showed a maternal leptin association with offspring' birthweight (R = -38%, p = 0.006) and with 3-month weight (R = -43%, p = 0.002). Accounting for confounders, these associations lost significance. Cord blood leptin concentrations positively correlated with birthweight and with 3-month weight (both, p < 0.001). The latter correlation, when adjusting for birthweight became negative (R = -43% p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: Our results showed that maternal leptin levels lost their influence on neonatal weight when considering confounders. At 3-month, once birthweight adjusted, the percent increasing of weight was statistically larger in preterm and IUGR than the full-term group and the correlation between cord blood leptin and weight turned negative, from positive at birth. These data may be a clue for further investigation on the relationship between perinatal leptin concentrations and catch-up growth.

AB  - Background: Leptin is a hormone regulating lifetime energy homeostasis and metabolism and its concentration is important starting from prenatal life. We aimed to investigate the association of perinatal leptin concentrations with growth trajectories during the first year of life. Methods: Prospective, longitudinal study, measuring leptin concentration in maternal plasma before delivery, cord blood (CB), and mature breast milk and correlating their impact on neonate's bodyweight from birth to 1 year of age, in 16 full-term (FT), 16 preterm (PT), and 13 intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) neonates. Results: Maternal leptin concentrations were highest in the PT group, followed by IUGR and FT, with no statistical differences among groups (p = 0.213). CB leptin concentrations were significantly higher in FT compared with PT and IUGR neonates (PT vs. FT; IUGR vs. FT: p < 0.001). Maternal milk leptin concentrations were low, with no difference among groups. Maternal leptin and milk concentrations were negatively associated with all the neonates' weight changes (p = 0.017 and p = 0.006), while the association with CB leptin was not significant (p = 0.051). Considering each subgroup individually, statistical analysis confirmed the previous results in PT and IUGR infants, with the highest value in the PT subgroup. In addition, this group's results negatively correlated with CB leptin (p = 0.026) and showed the largest % weight increase. Conclusions : Leptin might play a role in neonatal growth trajectories, characterized by an inverse correlation with maternal plasma and milk. PT infants showed the highest correlation with hormone levels, regardless of source, seeming the most affected group by leptin guidance. Low leptin levels appeared to contribute to critical neonates' ability to recover a correct body weight at 1 year. An eventual non-physiological "catch-up growth" should be monitored, and leptin perinatal levels may be an indicative tool. Further investigations are needed to strengthen the results.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective was to determine the value of clinical and analytical maternal factors to predict birth weight and umbilical cord biochemical markers of diabetic fetopathy., METHODS: Prospective evaluation of gestational diabetes pregnancies (n = 50). Maternal weight-related clinical and analytical factors were collected during pregnancy. After birth, an umbilical cord sample was taken., RESULTS: Univariate linear regression analysis showed relationship between maternal weight, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) with birth weight percentile. A significant association was found between maternal weight and cord insulin and C-peptide. Maternal HbA1c, leptin and insulin during pregnancy showed a positive linear association to cord leptin, insulin and C-peptide. In multivariate analysis models, final maternal BMI showed an independent positive association with cord C-peptide., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal weight-related and analytical parameters show diagnostic value to birth weight and cord markers.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to evaluate third-trimester fetal liver biometry, to predict birth weight and cord markers at birth in diabetic pregnancies., STUDY DESIGN: Fetal liver biometry (liver diameters, area and volume) was obtained between 32 and 34 weeks. A blood sample was obtained from cord after birth. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve models were evaluated for 75th and 90th birth weight percentile. Univariate and multivariate models were used., RESULT: All the hepatic diameters, area and sectional volume demonstrated significant differences in both birth weight percentile 75 and 90. All ROC curves showed significant values. A significant association was observed for all measurements with birth weight. In multivariate model, liver area volume gave significant values for predicting birth weight. Cord leptin, c-peptide and ferritin were related to fetal hepatic size., CONCLUSION: The hepatic changes in gestational diabetes were valid to predict birth weight and metabolic changes at birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the value of third trimester ultrasound (estimated fetal weight, cheek-to-cheek diameter, sectional Wharton's jelly area, sectional areas and fractional volumes in extremities) to predict birth weight and cord biochemical markers at birth (leptin, insulin, c-peptide, IGF1, erythropoietin and ferritin) in diabetic pregnancies., METHOD: Prospective study in 49 patients with gestational diabetes. An ultrasound was performed between 32 and 34 weeks. Clinical data were collected, and a blood sample was obtained from cord after birth. ROC curve models were evaluated for 75(th) and 90(th) birth weight percentile. Univariate and multivariate models were used to assess the association between ultrasound and neonatal outcomes., RESULTS: Sectional areas and fractional volumes showed significant differences and highest AUC values for predicting birth weight. A significant association was found for extremities measurements with total birth weight and its percentile. The only marker which showed a significant association to estimated fetal weight was erythropoietin. Sectional areas and fractional volumes related to cord leptin, erythropoietin, insulin and c-peptide., CONCLUSION: Sectional areas and fractional volumes improve the predictive value of estimated fetal weight in diabetic pregnancies. They also show a predictive association to biochemical changes in cord (leptin, insulin and erythropoietin) related to increased adiposity and risk of fetal hypoxia. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Context Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is particularly abundant in neonates, but its association with measures of adiposity and metabolic health in early infancy is poorly delineated. Besides sustaining nonshivering thermogenesis, BAT secretes brown adipokines that act on systemic metabolism. The chemokine CXCL14 has been identified as a brown adipokine in experimental studies. Objective To determine the relationships among BAT activity, adiposity, and circulating CXCL14 levels in the first year of life in girls and boys. Methods Indices of fat accretion, circulating endocrine-metabolic parameters and serum CXCL14 levels were assessed longitudinally in a cohort of infants at birth and at 4 and 12 months. BAT activity was estimated using infrared thermography only at age 12 months. The main outcome measures were weight and length Z-scores, total and abdominal fat content (by dual X-ray absorptiometry), BAT activity at the posterior cervical and supraclavicular regions, serum levels of glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor-I, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, and CXCL14; CXCL14 transcript levels in neonatal BAT and liver. Results Posterior cervical BAT was more active in girls than in boys (P = .02). BAT activity was negatively associated with adiposity parameters only in girls. CXCL14 levels were higher in girls than in boys at age 12 months and correlated positively with the area of active posterior cervical BAT in girls. Neonatal BAT showed high CXCL14 gene expression levels. Conclusion BAT activity and the levels of CXCL14-a potential surrogate of BAT activity-are sex specific in the first year of life. Posterior cervical BAT activity associates negatively with indices of adiposity only in girls.

AB  - Objective: Bone morphogenetic protein-8B (BMP8B) is an adipokine produced by brown adipose tissue (BAT) contributing to thermoregulation and metabolic homeostasis in rodent models. In humans, BAT activity is particularly relevant in newborns and young infants. We assessed BMP8B levels and their relationship with BAT activity and endocrine-metabolic parameters in young infants to ascertain its potentiality as biomarker in early life., Materials and Methods: BMP8B concentrations were assessed longitudinally by ELISA in a cohort of 27 girls and 23 boys at birth, and at age 4 and 12 months, together with adiposity parameters (DXA), and circulating endocrine-metabolic variables. BAT activity was measured by infrared thermography. BMP8B gene expression (qRT-PCR) was determined in BAT, white fat, and liver samples from neonatal necropsies, and in placenta and cord blood., Results: BMP8B levels were high at birth, particularly in boys (P = 0.04 vs. girls), declined progressively, and remained well above those in healthy adults and pregnant women at age 1 year (P < 0.05 and P < 0.001, respectively). Neonatal BMP8B transcript levels were higher in BAT than in white fat, liver and cord blood. Circulating BMP8B levels during the first year of life marginally correlated with bone mineral density and gains in lean mass., Conclusion: BMP8B levels are high at birth and decline progressively over the first year of life remaining above adult levels. Although changes in BMP8B concentrations overall reflect those in BAT activity during development, BMP8B levels are unlikely to be useful to predict individual variations in endocrine-metabolic status and BAT activity in healthy young infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess cord blood leptin levels in preterm and small-for-gestational age neonates and determine whether fetal leptin levels correlate with selected clinical parameters associated with prematurity and undernutrition at birth., DESIGN: Study of preterm newborns (p-AGA; n = 31) and small-for-gestational age (t-SGA; n = 23) cases in a population of neonates born in Szczecin between September 2001 and June 2002., METHODS: Fetal cord blood was sampled after delivery. Leptin levels were measured by RIA. Anthropometric data (birth weight, birth length, head and chest circumferences, body mass index, Ponderal index) were also recorded., RESULTS: Cord blood leptin levels did not differ significantly between p-AGA and t-SGA neonates with similar birthweight. Among the two groups of newborns the correlations between fetal leptin and anthropometric data were only observed in p-AGAs, but not in t-SGA group., CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that cord blood leptin level depends on body mass rather than maturity of newborn. It is also hypothesized that leptin level in SGA neonates is determined by other than anthropometric parameters used in this study.

AB  - CONTEXT: Over the past decade, a growing body of scientific evidence has suggested an exquisite association between oral infection and systemic diseases (e.g. atherosclerosis, cardiovascular diseases, premature or low birth weight babies, pulmonary diseases, etc.) and also between systemic diseases (e.g. arthritis, diabetes, HIV infection and osteoporosis) and oral and craniofacial diseases and disorders. Leptin is a hormone secreted by the adipocytes in varying quantities and regulates the body weight. The present study was undertaken in the context of knowing the role of leptin in the inflammatory process occurring in the gingiva as the disease progressed from gingivitis to periodontitis., AIMS: The present study was done to correlate the concentrations of leptin and interleukin (IL)-6 within the gingiva in healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis groups of patients and to correlate gingival leptin and IL-6 concentrations with plasma leptin and IL-6 concentrations in the healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis groups of patients., SETTINGS AND DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study and was carried out on the patients from the out-patient department of Periodontics in A B Shetty Memorial Institute of Dental Sciences., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventy-five patients in the age group of 18-60 years were selected and grouped based on the gingival index (Loe and Sillness) and their clinical attachment levels into healthy, gingivitis and periodontitis groups. Leptin and IL-6 levels were estimated within gingiva and the plasma of each subject using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. The results of this study were tabulated and subjected to statistical analysis. Mean and the standard deviation were calculated using analysis of variance Fisher's F-test and then the results were subjected to Tukey's Honest significance difference method for multiple comparison among the three groups. Correlation among the three groups was estimated using Pearson's correlation analysis., RESULTS: Results showed a statistically significant decrease in the concentration of gingival leptin and a statistically significant increase in the concentration of plasma leptin as the gingival disease progressed., CONCLUSION: It was concluded that as the gingival disease progressed, the gingival leptin concentration decreased, whereas the plasma leptin concentration increased, indicating a possible correlation between leptin concentration in the gingiva and the risk of developing systemic disease like the cardiovascular disease.

AB  - Background: Differing environmental conditions experienced by mother-infant dyads may influence composition of the milk received by the infant. As a consequence, diverse milk compositional profiles may contribute to different postnatal outcomes, especially in infants facing adverse perinatal environments. We investigated whether variability in milk concentrations of key metabolic hormones is associated with different growth outcomes in infants born preterm, a perinatal complication known to impact on infant growth. Methods: Human milk samples were collected from 169 mothers of 191 infants enrolled in the DIAMOND trial, a randomized trial of nutrition for moderate-late preterm infants, at 5 and 10 days postpartum and again at 4 months' corrected age and analyzed for leptin, adiponectin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1. Infant weight and body composition were measured at birth, discharge and 4 months' corrected age. Multiple linear regression models were used to examine correlations between milk hormone concentrations, weight z-scores and body composition at discharge and 4 months' corrected age, and weight gain from birth to 4 months' corrected age. Sex-specific interactions were examined. Results: Higher milk IGF-1 concentrations on day 5 after birth were associated with greater infant fat-free mass at 4 months' corrected age. Milk IGF-1 concentrations at 4 months were positively associated with fat mass and fat-free mass at 4 months in boys but not girls. Milk leptin concentrations on day 5 after birth were positively associated with fat mass at discharge from hospital, but negatively associated with fat mass at 4 months' corrected age. No significant association was found for milk adiponectin concentrations. Conclusion: Milk IGF-1 and leptin concentrations in mothers of moderate-late preterm babies are associated with different growth and body composition through to 4 months' corrected age and these associations are often different in boys and girls. The sex-specific effects of nutrient and hormone exposure during early life in preterm infants warrants further investigation to optimize the nutritional care these infants receive, particularly in hospital, where the same nutrition is provided to boys and girls.

AB  - Background: Human milk bioactives may play a role in infant health and development. Although the variability in their concentrations in milk is well-established, the impact of differential milk profiles on infant growth outcomes remains unclear. Thus, the aim of the present study was to investigate whether different concentrations of metabolic hormones are associated with different weight and BMI in infants beyond the first year of life. Methods: Milk samples at 2.6 (+/-0.4) months after birth and anthropometric measures at 13 months, 2, 3, and 5 years were collected as part of the Finnish STEPS cohort study from 501 mothers and the respective 507 infants. Leptin, adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1 and cyclic glycine-proline (cGP) in milk were analyzed. Multiple regression models and a repeated measures mixed model were used to examine associations between milk hormone concentrations and weight and BMI z-scores across time, at each time-point, and weight gain from birth to each follow-up visit. All models were corrected for birth weight, infant sex, duration of exclusive and total breastfeeding, time of introduction of solid foods and maternal pre-pregnancy BMI. Results: Higher milk IGF-1 was associated with higher weight at 13 months (p = 0.004) but lower weight at 3 (p = 0.011) and 5 years of age (p = 0.049). Higher cGP was associated with lower weight across the 5 years (p = 0.019) but with higher BMI at 5 years (p = 0.021). Leptin and adiponectin did not display associations with infant growth at this time. Sex interactions were also absent. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the interplay between human milk-borne IGF-1 and cGP is similar to that reported in other mammals and may have an important role in defining infant growth trajectories beyond the first year of life. Further research should explore the determinants and origins of these milk-borne compounds and evaluate their effect on infant growth and metabolism.

AB  - Changes in fetal DNA methylation (DNAm) of the leptin (LEP) gene have been associated with exposure to maternal hyperglycemia, but their links with childhood obesity risk are still unclear. We investigated the association between maternal hyperglycemia, placental LEP DNAm (25 5'-C-phosphate-G-3' (CpG) sites), neonatal leptinemia, and adiposity (i.e., BMI and skinfold thickness (ST) (subscapular (SS) + triceps (TR) skinfold measures, and the ratio of SS:TR) at 3-years-old, in 259 mother-child dyads, from Gen3G birth cohort. We conducted multivariate linear analyses adjusted for gestational age at birth, sex of the child, age at follow-up, and cellular heterogeneity. We assessed the causal role of DNAm in the association between maternal glycemia and childhood outcomes, using mediation analysis. We found three CpGs associated with neonatal leptinemia (p <= 0.002). Of these, cg05136031 and cg15758240 were also associated with BMI (beta = -2.69, p = 0.05) and fat distribution (beta = -0.581, p = 0.05) at 3-years-old, respectively. Maternal glycemia was associated with DNAm at cg15758240 (beta = -0.01, p = 0.04) and neonatal leptinemia (beta = 0.19, p = 0.004). DNAm levels at cg15758240 mediates 0.8% of the association between maternal glycemia and neonatal leptinemia (p < 0.001). Our results support that DNAm regulation of the leptin pathway in response to maternal glycemia might be involved in programming adiposity in childhood.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The fetus that fails to meet its ideal growth trajectory has increased risks of poor health outcomes throughout life. "Gold standard" methods of anthropometric assessment such as measurement of percentage body fat can be difficult to apply across populations and other biomarkers such as serum concentration of umbilical cord blood leptin may be more effective for screening. This study reports cord blood leptin levels in a large prospective consecutive birth cohort and assesses the relationship between leptin and neonatal and maternal factors., METHODS: Venous umbilical cord blood samples were collected from a prospective consecutive cohort of pregnancies at the time of delivery. Maternal and neonatal characteristics and details of delivery were collated. Serum leptin levels were measured, associations with demographic features were identified, and a normal range was established. The association between cord leptin level and neonatal outcome was tested., RESULTS: Umbilical cord leptin and maternal and neonatal characteristics were collected at 1275 births. The median leptin value was 10.8 ng/ml (IQR: 6.4, 17.8 ng/ml). Log10 leptin was significantly associated with gestation at delivery, birthweight (BWt), infant sex, plurality, and maternal body mass index (BMI) (p < .001). Observed leptin values were expressed as multiples of the median (MoM). The mean leptin MoM was significantly lower in infants admitted to NICU following delivery (0.85; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.78-0.91 versus 1.05; 95% CI: 1.03-1.06 (controls), p < .001). There was no significant association between leptin MoM values and 5-min Apgar scores., CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal cord leptin levels are influenced by a number of maternal and fetal characteristics. Absolute levels can be adjusted to account for normal population variation. Infants requiring admission to NICU have lower mean leptin MoM levels. Further studies are needed to see whether the identification of fetuses with polarized leptin levels (<5th or >95th centile) will benefit from further surveillance or intervention in infancy.

AB  - Objective: To determine the levels of adiponectin and its subforms before and immediately after delivery to estimate the effect of cessating advanced pregnancy on circulating adiponectin levels. Design and methods: In a cohort of 37 women with uncomplicated singleton pregnancies and 6 women with twin pregnancies, serum adiponectin was measured before caesarean section (CS) in the fasting state, and 24 and 48 h after CS. Results: Serum adiponectin levels declined within 24 h of delivery from median 8.34 mg/l (range 5.57-20.47) to 6.81 mg/l (4.16-17.39) after 24 h and 6.84 mg/l (3.83-17.42) after 48 h. This corresponded to a relative decrease to 83+/-6 and 81+/-7% of pregnant values after 24 and 48 h respectively (P<0.001, ANOVA). In twin pregnancies, maternal adiponectin levels displayed a decrease that was the same as that displayed by them after birth (P<0.001). High-molecular weight adiponectin constituted 50+/-8% (range 34-68%) of total adiponectin. Absolute changes in adiponectin levels after delivery were most pronounced in this subfraction. The percentage medium-molecular weight adiponectin decreased slightly, but significantly (from 37+/-6 to 35+/-5%, P<0.001), and a similar statistically significant rise was observed in the low-molecular weight fraction (from 13+/-2 to 15+/-3%; P<0.001) within 48 h of delivery. Conclusions: Decreases in adiponectin levels occur shortly after delivery, and adiponectin subforms initiate the changes towards the non-pregnant state.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Serum retinol binding protein (RBP4) is the binding protein for retinol, being delivered into the circulation through the carrier protein transthyretin (TTR) together with thyroxin (T4). RBP4 has also been recently indicated as a new adipokine implicated in insulin resistance and metabolism regulation., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of RBP4 as early markers of fetal growth restriction (FGR) and preeclampsia (PE) in maternal serum during the first trimester of pregnancy., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospective case control study in patients between the 12th and the 14th week of gestation. RBP4, TTR and T4 concentration was assessed in maternal serum of three groups of women: 15 and 14 patients later developing respectively FGR and PE were compared with 11 patients having a normal pregnancy., RESULTS: All women were Caucasian and the mean maternal age was 33.62 years (+/-5.50). RBP4 resulted lower in the FGR than in the control group (11.00 versus 16.00 microg/ml, p < 0.05) and than in the PE group (15.00 microg/ml, p = 0.075), both in bivariate and multivariate analysis. No difference was observed in TTR and T4 concentration., CONCLUSIONS: RBP4 seems to play a role as early marker of FGR but not PE in first trimester maternal serum.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Evidence that fetal development has long-term impacts on health has increased interest in maternal-fetal nutrient exchange. Although maternal metabolism is known to change during gestation to accommodate fetal nutrient demands, little is known about these modifications outside of a Western, clinical context. This study characterizes maternal metabolic adaptations to pregnancy, and their associations with offspring birth weight (BW), among women living in the Philippines., METHODS: Fasting glucose, triglycerides, insulin, leptin, and adiponectin were assessed in 808 participants in the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey (Metropolitan Cebu, Philippines). Cross-sectional relationships between metabolites and hormones and gestational and lactational status were evaluated. Among the subset of currently pregnant women, associations between maternal glucose and triglycerides and offspring BW were also examined., RESULTS: Women in their second and third trimesters had significantly lower fasting glucose and adiponectin compared to nulliparous women, and leptin levels and triglyceride levels were notably higher late in pregnancy (all P < .05). Among pregnant women, fasting glucose was a positive predictor of offspring BW, but only in males (P = .012, R2 = .28). Hormones and metabolites in post-partum women trend back toward levels found in nulliparous women, with some differences by breastfeeding status., CONCLUSIONS: We find evidence for marked changes in maternal lipid and carbohydrate metabolism during pregnancy, consistent with known adaptations to support fetal growth. The finding of sex-specific relationships between maternal glucose and offspring BW adds to evidence for greater impacts of the maternal-gestational environment on biology and health in male offspring.

AB  - A major 40-KDA protein secreted by human prostate was isolated from whole seminal plasma by sequential column chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B, concanavalin A(Con A)-Sepharose, and Sephadex G-100. Although the purified preparation still contained minor contaminants, its amino acid composition was found to be identical to the one of a glycoprotein isolated previously from seminal plasma by Lin et al (1983). Antibodies against this protein were produced in rabbits and their use in immunoblotting experiments revealed the presence of the antigen in several tissues including the prostate, the liver, the heart, the kidney, the epididymis, and the testis. A radioimmunoassay confirmed these results and showed that blood serum concentrations of this protein were relatively high in men (81 +/- 3 micrograms/ml), women (68 +/- 3 micrograms/ml), and cord blood of newborns (32 +/- 1 micrograms/ml). The serum concentrations of this protein along with its physicochemical characteristics suggested that it could be identical to Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein, a human serum protein previously isolated by Burgi and Schmid (1961). This hypothesis was confirmed by a double immunodiffusion analysis using a commercial anti-Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein antiserum. Finally, in vitro translation of prostatic poly(A) + RNA in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in the presence of canine pancreatic microsomal membranes resulted in the formation of an immunoprecipitable 42-kDa band. These results show that Zn-alpha 2-glycoprotein can be synthesized in the prostate itself. The demonstration of high concentrations of this protein in prostatic tissue and prostatic secretion should facilitate the elucidation of its role in the prostate and in other tissues.

AB  - There are likely many scenarios and pathways that can lead to metabolic syndrome. This paper reviews mechanisms by which the accumulation of visceral adipose tissue (VAT) may contribute to the metabolic syndrome, and explores the paradigm of a critical VAT threshold (CVATT). Exceeding the CVATT may result in a number of metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance to glucose uptake by cells. Metabolic profiles of patients with visceral obesity may substantially improve after only modest weight loss. This could reflect a significant reduction in the amount of VAT relative to peripheral or subcutaneous fat depots, thereby maintaining VAT below the CVATT. The CVATT may be unique for each individual. This may help explain the phenomena of apparently lean individuals with metabolic syndrome, the so-called metabolically normal weight (MONW), as well as the obese with normal metabolic profiles, i.e., metabolically normal obese (MNO), and those who are "fit and fat." The concept of CVATT may have implications for prevention and treatment of metabolic syndrome, which may include controlling dietary carbohydrates. The identification of the CVATT is admittedly difficult and its anatomical boundaries are not well-defined. Thus, the CVATT will continue to be a work in progress. © 2004 Freedland; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of gestational diabetes on omentin-1 in maternal and cord plasma. As a potent mediator of insulin resistance, Omentin-1, an adipokine derived from human adipose and placental tissue, may be an important player in the pathophysiology of gestational diabetes., METHODS: This was a prospective case-control study. The study included 96 women with gestational diabetes and 96 pregnant women without. Omentin-1 was measured at the time of the oral glucose tolerance test, at 32 weeks in maternal plasma and right after delivery in umbilical cord blood by ELISA assay., RESULTS: Over a period of 2 years, 200 patients were enrolled. Omentin-1 levels did not significantly differ between both groups throughout the pregnancy: omentin-1 levels were 157 +/- 83 ng/ml in women with gestational diabetes and 158 +/- 93 ng/ml in women without gestational diabetes (p = 0.94) at time of the oral glucose tolerance test and 118 +/- 77 ng/ml in women with diabetes and 150 +/- 89 ng/ml in women without (p = 0.12) at 32 weeks, respectively. Both groups showed a decrease in omentin-1 levels throughout pregnancy, with a more pronounced decrease in diabetic women (13 +/- 53 versus 4 +/- 48 ng/ml; p = 0.5). Neonatal omentin-1 levels were significantly lower in offspring of diabetic mothers: 106 +/- 61 versus 134 +/- 45 ng/ml (p = 0.03)., CONCLUSIONS: There was no significant difference in omentin-1 levels between healthy and diabetic mothers throughout the pregnancy. However, we found significantly lower omentin-1 levels in offspring of diabetic mothers. This may indicate a risk for the development of insulin resistance in later life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Being born small for gestational age (SGA) is a known risk factor for greater neonatal mortality and disease in later life. Some determinants of the incidence of SGA newborns have been studied but little is known about the role of leptin in the beginning of pregnancy., OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of serum leptin concentration in the 1st gestational trimester on the incidence of SGA newborns and to identify other determining factors in the occurrence of SGA., METHODS: Prospective study with 195 pairs of mothers and their children monitored in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The dependent variable was SGA newborns, while the independent variables were sociodemographic, reproductive, anthropometric and biochemical variables. Statistical analysis was performed by means of logistic regression., RESULTS: The incidence of SGA was 11.3% (CI 95%: 7.31-16.46). The results showed that low concentrations (lowest tertile compared to 2nd and 3rd tertiles) of leptin (RR = 5.26; CI 95%: 1.91-9.56), insufficient gestational weight gain (RR = 3.16; CI 95%: 0.98-7.38), low stature (RR = 3.94; CI 95%: 1.22-8.57) and alcohol consumption during gestation (RR = 5.92; CI 95%: 1.44-12.92) were risk factors for SGA., CONCLUSIONS: Lower leptin concentrations were associated with a significant risk for SGA after adjusting for confounding variables. Maternal serum leptin at the beginning of gestation can be used as a marker for the early detection of SGA. Copyright 2009 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Leptin, homocysteine (Hcy), and C-reactive protein are risk factors potentially useful in predicting future cardiac events. These plasma biomarkers may participate in the regulation of cardiovascular function through an NO-dependent mechanism. Our purpose was to investigate whether alterations in C-reactive protein, Hcy, leptin, and NO are present in small-for-gestational-age children and to determine whether the levels of these plasma biomarkers are associated with birth weight, vascular function, and blood pressure. Concentrations of leptin, Hcy, C-reactive protein, and NO were measured in 69 children (36 boys and 33 girls; ages 8 to 13 years). Leptin (means difference: 1.4 ng/mL; 95% CI: 0.4 to 2.4) and Hcy (means difference: 0.9 micromol/L; 95% CI: 0.3 to 1.5) levels were significantly elevated in children born small for gestational age compared with those with appropriate birth weight. Nevertheless, NO (means difference: 342.9 micromol; 95% CI: 124.2 to 561.6) concentration was significantly reduced in small birth weight children, and the levels of C-reactive protein remained unchanged. There was a significant association between the circulating levels of both NO and Hcy with vascular function, as well as with blood pressure levels, in our population. Because both Hcy and NO are associated with a risk of cardiovascular disease, it is possible that part of the association of low birth weight with elevated risk for vascular and metabolic disease in later life is mediated by perturbation in pathways for these biomarkers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increased maternal adiposity and inflammation have impacts on fetal growth., OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this prospective study was to investigate the associations of 3 proinflammatory adipokines in pregnancy with neonatal anthropometry., METHODS: In a sample of 321 US pregnant women from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Fetal Growth Studies-Singleton Cohort (NCT00912132), plasma IL-6, fatty acid binding protein-4 (FABP4), and chemerin were measured in plasma samples collected at 10-14, 15-26, 23-31, and 33-39 weeks of gestation. Generalized linear models were used to estimate associations of adipokines with neonatal weight, thigh, and crown-heel length, and skinfolds at birth. Models adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, education, nulliparity, prepregnancy BMI, and weeks of gestation at blood collection., RESULTS: At each time point, higher IL-6 was associated with lower neonatal birthweight and thigh length. At 15-26 weeks of gestation, a 1 SD pg/mL increase in IL-6 was associated with -84.46 g lower neonatal birthweight (95% CI: -150.70, -18.22), -0.17 cm shorter thigh length (95% CI: -0.27, -0.07), -0.43 cm shorter crown-heel length (95% CI: -0.75, -0.10), and -0.75 mm smaller sum of skinfolds (95% CI: -1.19, -0.31), with similar associations at 23-31 and 33-39 weeks of gestation. There were no associations of FABP4 and chemerin with neonatal anthropometry., CONCLUSIONS: Starting as early as 15 weeks of gestation, higher maternal IL-6 concentrations in pregnancy were associated with lower neonatal birthweight, thigh and crown-heel length, and skinfolds. These data provide insight into the relevance of maternal inflammatory markers with neonatal anthropometry.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity and pregnancy may have synergistic effects on maternal periodontal tissues. In contrast, maternal obesity and periodontitis are antagonistic factors for the babies' weight at birth. This study evaluated, during pregnancy (T1) and after delivery (T2), periodontal parameters and salivary levels of cytokines in women with obesity, and the association of these outcomes with the baby's weight at birth., METHODS: After matching by age, socioeconomic status and systemic health, the sample was composed of pregnant women with obesity (GO = 25; BMI >=30 kg/m2) and normal BMI (GN = 25; BMI between 18.5 and 24.99 kg/m2), who were evaluated regarding: periodontal parameters; salivary levels of TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and leptin (Luminex R assay); and babies' weight at birth. Mann-Whitney, Friedman, ANOVA; chi-square and Cochran's Q tests were applied (p < 0.05)., RESULTS: GO showed higher prevalence of periodontitis in T1 and T2 (p <0.001), with higher salivary levels of TNF-alpha (p = 0.003) and IL-1beta (p = 0.009) in T1. IL-1beta significantly decreased after delivery in GO. No intergroup differences for leptin levels were found, but both groups had a significant reduction of leptin levels between periods (p <0.001). GO had children with lower birth weight (p = 0.022), being classified as low (<2,500 g) or insufficient (2,500-2,999 g) weight., DISCUSSION: It is suggestive that the inflammatory pattern caused by obesity and periodontitis, mainly related to high levels of TNF-alpha, impair the babies' weight at birth, resulting in more frequency of low/insufficient weight at birth.

AB  - PURPOSE: To ascertain the association between umbilical cord levels of adiponectin, leptin and resistin, and birth weight (BW) and newborn weight change (NWC) in the first 96 h of life., METHODS: 392 full-term singletons were recruited, in 2005/2006, at the five public units providing obstetrical and neonatal care in Porto. Information was collected by face-to-face interview and additionally from clinical records. Umbilical cord blood adipokines levels were determined and categorized using the 10th and 90th percentiles. Anthropometrics were obtained by trained examiners and NWC estimated as (weight - BW)/BW x 100, adjusted for newborn's age. Regression coefficients and 95% confidence intervals were calculated., RESULTS: Low leptin levels (<=5.6 ng/ml) were associated with lower BW (beta = -137.3 g 95%CI -268.6 g, -6.1 g) and high leptin levels (>=30.7 ng/ml) were associated with higher BW (beta = 276.3 g 95%CI 145.8 g, 406.8 g) and higher NWC (beta = 1.10% 95% CI 0.29%, 1.92%), comparing to newborns with normal leptin levels. Adiponectin and resistin were not associated with BW or NWC., CONCLUSION: High umbilical cord blood leptin levels predicted higher BW and lower weight loss in the immediate postnatal period.

AB  - Although circulating leptin and insulin concentration is linked to intrauterine growth, fetal development and birth weight in full-term infants, there has been no enquiry into the influence of cord blood insulin and leptin for catch-up growth in preterm infants. The study evaluated the association of cord blood leptin with growth and weight gain of 96 premature babies during 6 months (corrected age). The temporal changes of anthropometric indexes over this period were calculated by repeated random regression (PROC MIXED) using SAS. Cord blood leptin was negatively associated with the rate of change in BMI (p=0.01) and length (p<0.001), from birth until 64 postnatal weeks. Insulin was positively associated with the change rate in BMI (p=0.03); however, this disappeared when adjusted for birth weight. For the first time, the association between lower leptin levels with greater catch up growth is shown for both BMI and length among preterm children. In conclusion, leptin levels at birth, but not insulin levels, predict growth rates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Despite intensive research on the cytokine resistin only few studies investigated mother-newborn-pairs during healthy pregnancy and reported about interactions with clinical obstetric variables or other cytokines. Comparison of existing studies is difficult due to differences between assays, sample collection, gestational age, definition of healthy controls and patient characteristics. Furthermore, differences between rodent models and humans do not allow for a direct comparison., METHODS: In this cross-sectional, prospective study 109 healthy mother-newborn pairs were analyzed. Maternal venous blood samples were taken on admission to the labor ward; newborn venous blood samples were drawn from the placental part of the umbilical cord (UC), immediately after clamping. Resistin, leptin, adiponectin, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) serum concentrations were measured with commercially available immunoassays. Determinants of maternal and newborn resistin levels were analyzed using simple and multiple linear regression., RESULTS: UC resistin levels were higher than maternal concentrations (median 17.69 ng/mL, IQR 7.36 vs. median 8.04 ng/mL, IQR 4.30). Correlation between UC and maternal resistin levels was moderate (R = 0.503, p < 0.01). In multiple regression analysis levels of maternal resistin and newborn TNF-alpha remained significant determining factors for UC resistin levels. Gestational age and maternal BDNF-levels remained significant factors for maternal resistin levels., CONCLUSION: In healthy, term newborns and their respective mothers a positive correlation between maternal and newborn levels and an association with gestational age around term can be found and point to a placental source of resistin. Further investigations are needed to clarify the possible contribution of transplacental transport of resistin into the fetal circulation. Except for gestational age most of the clinical obstetric variables tested do not seem to be determining factors for fetal or maternal resistin. Interactions of resistin with other cytokines like TNF-alpha and BDNF could be the missing link for the conflicting results in literature. Copyright © 2021 The Authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cytokines are reported to be associated with various pregnancy complications and health outcomes of the offspring. However, reference values during pregnancy have not been established, effects of clinical and obstetric factors have not been examined, and interactions between different cytokines have not yet been reported., METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, we recruited 120 mother-newborn pairs. Maternal venous blood samples (6 mL) were taken on admission to the labor ward; newborn venous blood samples (6 mL) were drawn from the placental part of the umbilical cord (UC). Adiponectin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 serum concentrations were measured by commercial immunoassays. Clinical and obstetric variables were analyzed for their association with maternal and UC cytokine concentrations., RESULTS: Forty-six adiponectin pairs, 55 TNF-alpha pairs, and 14 IL-6 pairs were available for analysis. Correlation between UC and maternal adiponectin-, IL-6-, and TNF-alpha levels was low. We found a significant correlation of UC adiponectin with maternal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and maternal adiponectin, and between maternal leptin and maternal TNF-alpha., CONCLUSIONS: Clinical and obstetric variables as well as interactions between cytokines may have an impact on serum concentrations of the respective cytokines in maternal and UC blood. Further studies are required to confirm our findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Growth parameters during infancy and early childhood might predict adipokine levels later in life. This study investigates the association between peak growth velocities, body mass index (BMI) and age at adiposity rebound (AR), with leptin and adiponectin levels at age 10 years. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Peak height (PHV) and weight (PWV) velocities were calculated from height and weight measurements obtained between birth and age 2 years from 2880 children participating in the GINIplus (German Infant Nutritional Intervention plus environmental and genetic influences on allergy development) and LISAplus (Influences of Lifestyle-Related Factors on the Immune System and the Development of Allergies in Childhood plus Air Pollution and Genetics) birth cohorts. BMI and age at AR were calculated using BMI measurements between age 1.5 and 12 years. Blood samples were collected during a physical examination at age 10. Adiponectin and leptin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay. Linear regression models were fitted after adjustment for potential confounding factors and results are presented per interquartile range increase in the exposure. RESULTS: Age at AR was negatively associated with leptin in males and females (percent difference beta*: -41.71%; 95% confidence interval: (-44.34; -38.96) and beta*: -43.22%; (-45.59; -40.75), respectively). For both males and females PWV (beta*: 14.23%; (7.60; 21.26) and beta*: 18.54%; (10.76; 26.87), respectively) and BMI at AR (beta*: 63.08%; (55.04; 71.53) and beta*: 67.02%; (59.30; 75.10), respectively) were positively associated with leptin levels. PHV showed a positive effect on leptin in females only (beta*: 10.75%; (3.73; 18.25)). Growth parameters were not significantly associated with adiponectin except for age at AR among females (beta: 0.75 ng/ml; (0.42; 1.09)) and PWV among males (beta: 0.45 ng/ml; (0.11; 0.79)). CONCLUSION: Growth patterns in early life may be associated with leptin levels at age 10 years.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with low fetal growth and adverse cardiometabolic health in offspring. However, hormonal pathways underlying these associations are unclear. Therefore, we examined maternal smoking habits and umbilical cord blood hormone profiles in a large, prospective cohort., METHODS: We studied 978 mother/infant pairs in Project Viva, a Boston-area cohort recruited 1999-2002. We categorized mothers as early pregnancy smokers, former smokers, or never smokers. Outcomes were cord blood concentrations of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, and C-peptide. We used linear regression models adjusted for maternal pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), race/ethnicity, parity, education, and infant sex. We conducted analyses in the full cohort and stratified by infant sex., RESULTS: Thirteen percent of women were early pregnancy smokers, 20% former smokers, and 68% never smokers. Infants of early pregnancy smokers had lower IGF-1 adjusted for IGFBP-3 [-5.2ng/mL (95% CI: -8.6, -1.7)], with more pronounced associations in girls [-10.7ng/mL (95% CI: -18.5, -2.9) vs. -4.0ng/mL (95% CI: -8.4, 0.4) for boys]. Early pregnancy smoking was not associated with cord blood hormones other than IGF-1. Infants of former smokers had a cord blood hormone profile similar to infants of never smokers., CONCLUSIONS: As compared to mothers who never smoked, early pregnancy smokers had infants with lower cord blood IGF-1 which could prime adverse metabolic outcomes. This provides further reason to support smoking cessation programs in women of reproductive age. Copyright © 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Current studies claim that peptides such as leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, and nesfatin-1 found in breast milk may be responsible for the growth of infants. Therefore, we aimed to determine the association between breast milk total ghrelin and nesfatin-1 levels and anthropometric measurements of infants who were small for gestational age (SGA)., METHODS: 20 SGA and 20 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric measurements of infants were carried out at birth, 1st, and 4th months. In addition, total ghrelin and nesfatin-1 levels in the breast milk were concomitantly measured., RESULTS: Total ghrelin at the 4th month in breast milk waslower-level in the SGA group (p=0.015). In both groups, nesfatin-1 levels at the 4th month were lower than the values at the 1st month. Additionally, nesfatin-1 levels of SGA infants at the 4th month were higher (p=0.035)., CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk total ghrelin and nesfatin-1 levels differed in both groups, and it is probably referred to the growth discrepancy of these infants during the first months of life. Furthermore, we consider that higher breast milk nesfatin-1 levels at the 4th month may be a preventive against obesity in SGA infants who have potential risk for obesity in childhood and adulthood.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Obesity and/or psychopathological disorders of parents represent risk factors for childhood obesity. The aim of the study was to investigate the link between obesity in pregnancy and oxidative stress., METHODS: Venous blood was collected from 37 women at the eighth month of gestation (19 obese and 28 normal weight). Cord blood was obtained at birth from newborns of obese mothers and controls. Cord blood and maternal blood was used to separate plasma to be used for the evaluation of leptin, oxidized LDL and paraoxonase (PON1) activity., RESULTS: Higher levels of leptin were observed both in maternal blood and cord blood of children of obese women compared to normal-weight women. The data also showed lower levels of PON1 activity in plasma of obese women and in the cord blood of their children. Furthermore, a positive correlation was established between levels of PON1 activity in maternal blood and cord blood, suggesting a relationship between PON1 in maternal plasma and fetal cord blood., CONCLUSIONS: Essential obesity in pregnancy is associated with hyperleptinemia. PON1 exerts an antioxidant role; therefore, our results demonstrated that obesity exposes to an increased susceptibility to oxidative damage in both mothers and newborns.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if the maternal serum levels of visfatin in the first trimester of pregnancy are altered in cases that develop preeclampsia (PE) and whether the levels are related to placental perfusion reflected in uterine artery pulsatility index (PI). Serum visfatin and uterine artery PI were measured at 11(+0)-13(-6) weeks in 80 cases that developed PE and 240 unaffected controls. The median visfatin and uterine artery PI multiple of the unaffected median (MoM) in the outcome groups was compared and the significance of the association between visfatin MoM and uterine artery PI MoM, birth weight percentile and gestation at delivery was determined. In the PE group, compared with controls, there was a significantly higher median visfatin MoM (1.35, interquartile range (IQR): 0.69-2.16 vs 1.00, IQR: 0.55-1.96, P = 0.027) and uterine artery PI MoM (1.19, IQR: 0.95-1.44 vs 1.03, IQR: 0.83-1.22, P<0.0001). In the PE group, there was no significant association between serum visfatin MoM and uterine artery PI MoM (P = 0.589), gestation at delivery (P = 0.763) or birth weight percentile (P = 0.646). Serum visfatin levels at 11-13 weeks are increased in women who develop PE by a mechanism unrelated to impaired placental perfusion.

AB  - STUDY QUESTION: Does maternal obesity affect insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis protein expression patterns in maternal and cord blood?, SUMMARY ANSWER: Maternal obesity attenuates cord blood expression of IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-4., WHAT IS KNOWN AND WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The IGF axis plays a critical role in fetal growth and development. Maternal obesity compromises IGF axis protein expression in fetal circulation, which is consistent with the findings of epidemiological studies suggesting that maternal obesity has an independent effect on fetal growth signals during in utero development., STUDY DESIGN: This cross-sectional case-control study involved 12 lean [body mass index (BMI) 18.5-24.9 kg/m2] and 12 obese (BMI>=30 kg/m2) women and their neonates at term. At the completion of the study, IGF axis protein expression and hormone concentrations in both maternal and cord blood were examined., PARTICIPANTS AND SETTING: We obtained fasting serum samples from cases and controls matched for age, gestation, mode of delivery, parity and glucose tolerance prior to and immediately following elective caesarean section. The corresponding umbilical cord blood was also collected at birth., MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Between-group comparisons revealed elevated maternal insulin (P=0.03) and leptin (P<0.01) concentrations in obese gravidas. After adjustment, the maternal homeostasis model of assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score was positively correlated with both maternal BMI and leptin levels (P<0.01). Umbilical cord blood levels of IGFBP-3 showed an inverse trend to maternal HOMA-IR (P=0.03) but were directly related to the fetal-placental weight ratio (P<0.01). In cord serum from obese mothers, IGFBP-4 expression was attenuated compared with the controls (P<0.05)., LIMITATIONS: The limitations of our study include the cross-sectional design and relatively small sample size., WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Our results provide preliminary evidence for the applicability of our findings to other ethnic groups when pregnancy is complicated by obesity., STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This work was supported by the University of Ottawa, Faculty of Health Sciences/Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Partnership Grant awarded to K.B.A. and Z.M.F. The authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.

AB  - Lifestyle during pregnancy impacts the health of the mother and child. However, the extent to which physical activity affects maternal biomarkers and factors that might influence birth weight remains unclear. We analysed data from two lifestyle interventions in which the effects of an exercise programme (2x/week, 60-90 min) on the course of pregnancy with regard to adipokines and offspring were evaluated. A total of 70 women participated in this study (45, intervention group; 25, control group). Anthropometric data and maternal fasting serum leptin and resistin levels were measured at three time points (approximately 14th (T1), 24th (T2), and 36th (T3) weeks of gestation). Neonatal/child data were retrieved from screening examinations. Independent of the intervention, we found a positive correlation between the fat mass at T1 and both leptin and resistin levels at all time points. Leptin level was significantly higher in the control group at T3; however, no differences between the groups were found for resistin. The birth weight was influenced by the birth length, fat mass at T1/T3, and resistin level at T2. The BMI-SDS at one year of age was influenced by maternal fat-free mass at T3 and resistin at T1/T2. Even if these results can only be interpreted cautiously, lifestyle interventions during pregnancy are important in promoting maternal and child health. Further randomised controlled trials and translational studies are warranted to clarify the underlying mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity in childhood is increasing worldwide and may be affected by genetic factors and the lifestyle (exercise, nutrition behavior) of expectant parents. Lifestyle factors affect adipokines, namely leptin, resistin, and adiponectin as well as cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which are involved in the regulation of maternal metabolic homeostasis, glucose metabolism, and the development of insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, gestational diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. However, studies focusing on the effect of exercise or a combination of parental exercise and nutrition on the above-mentioned markers in newborns (venous cord blood) and especially on the long-term development of infants' weight gain are lacking. The study will investigate the effects of a multimodal intervention (regular exercise, diet) on parental and childhood adipocytokines (leptin, resistin, adiponectin, TNF-alpha, IL-6, BDNF). The effect of a lifestyle-related change in "fetal environmental conditions" on the long-term weight development of the child up to the age of two will also be assessed., METHODS/DESIGN: A randomized multi-center controlled trial will be conducted in Germany, comparing supervised aerobic and resistance training 2x/week (13th to 36th weeks of gestation) and nutritional counseling (6th to 36th weeks of gestation) during pregnancy with usual care. Thirty women (pre-pregnancy Body Mass Index >=25 kg/m2, 6th-10th week of gestation) will be included in each group. Maternal anthropometric and physical measurements as well as blood sampling will occur at the 6th-10th, 13th-14th, 21st-24th, and 36th week of gestation, at delivery as well as 8 weeks and 24 months postpartum. Neonatal measurements and umbilical blood sampling will be performed at birth. Maternal and infants' weight development will be assessed every 6 months till 24 months postpartum. A difference in childhood BMI of 1 kg/m2 at the age of two years between both groups will be assumed. A power size of 80% using a significance level of 0.05 and an effect size of 1.0 is presumed., DISCUSSION: A better understanding of how lifestyle-related changes in the fetal environment might influence infants' outcome after two years of life could have a profound impact on the prevention and development of infants' obesity., TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial is registered at the German Clinical Trial Register (DRKS00007702); Registered on 10th of August 2016; retrospectively registered https://www.drks.de/drks_web/navigate.do?navigationId=trial.HTML&TRIAL_ID=DRKS00007702.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) leads to increased predisposition to metabolic syndrome in adult life but the mechanisms remain obscure. Considering a significant number of functional similarities, IUGR piglets appear to be a good model to study the development of this syndrome in humans. The aim of the present study was to investigate the ultrastructure and proteomic profile of the liver in IUGR pig neonates to discover early markers of predisposition to obesity and insulin resistance. In our study intestine and liver tissue samples were investigated in 7 day old IUGR and normal body weight (NBW) littermate piglets using histometry, mass spectrometry, in-tissue cytometry analysis and confocal microscopy. Compared to NBW, the liver in IUGR neonates was characterized by a significantly enhanced ratio of Kupffer cells to hepatocytes and insulin receptor abundance as well as higher percentages of cells expressing receptors for adipokines (resistin and adiponectin), increased expression of TNF-alpha (as marker of inflammation), and increased expression of insulin receptor and uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3). Moreover, NBW and IUGR differed in proteomic profile, including protein metabolism (proteasomes, cathepsin D, phermitin, phosphoglucomutase), carbohydrate metabolism (hexokinase 1, phosphoglucokinase, galactokinase, aldolase B, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase), oxidative stress and chromatin organization and DNA uptake (histones, lamin a/c). Reduction of hepatocyte numbers concomitant with significant modifications of expression of key hormones and enzymes for protein and carbohydrate metabolism in IUGR neonates may predispose to insulin resistance and obesity in adult life.

AB  - Adiponectin potentially influences fetal weight by altering insulin signaling and trans-placental amino acid and glucose transporters. The objective of this study was to determine how maternal obesity influences maternal and fetal plasma concentrations of adiponectin, expression of fetal adiponectin, its receptors, and adipogenic genes at mid- and late-gestation. Blood samples and tissues were collected from obese and control multiparous pregnant ewes at day 75 or 135 of gestation. Although day of gestation or maternal obesity did not influence (P > 0.6) maternal plasma concentrations of adiponectin, fetal weight was increased (P < 0.001) and adiponectin tended to decrease (P = 0.10) at mid-gestation in fetuses from obese ewes. Differences were not apparent at late-gestation (P > 0.70). Relative abundance of adiponectin (P = 0.01), AdipoR2 (P = 0.04) and PPAR gamma (P = 0.01) mRNA was less at mid-gestation in fetal adipose tissue from obese mothers. By late gestation, maternal obesity tended to associated with a decrease in relative abundance of adiponectin (P = 0.09) and SREBF1 (P = 0.10) mRNA in fetal adipose tissue. Maternal obesity did not influence (P >= 0.20) the relative abundance of adiponectin, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 mRNA in cotyledonary tissue at mid or late- gestation. In conclusion, maternal obesity in sheep influences relative abundance of fetal adipose tissue mRNA for adiponectin and adipogenic, as well as plasma concentrations of total adiponectin. Although adiposity in pregnant ewes did not influence maternal adiponectin, maternal obesity potentially influenced fetal adipogenesis by altering the abundance of adiponectin, PPAR gamma and SREBF1 mRNA in fetal adipose tissue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rate of cesarean section is increasing worldwide. Adiponectin is a hormone related to anti-inflammatory and anti-atherogenic effects; and it's concentrations may change in response to inflammatory situations including surgical intervention. The aim of the current study was to investigate serum adiponectin levels in maternal and umbilical cord blood according to different modes of delivery and their relationship with anthropometric measurements and fetal sex., METHODS: The study population initially comprised 90 healthy pregnant women referred to the teaching hospital. Eventually, 40 participants in the vaginal delivery group and 35 subjects in the cesarean delivery group were recruited in to the study. Umbilical cord blood and maternal serum samples were analyzed according to the standard protocol from the manufacturer. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS-16 software. P-value < 0.05 was considered as the significance level for all tests., RESULTS: Our results indicated a significant association between maternal adiponectin and the mode of delivery, with adiponectin levels significantly higher in vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section (P < 0.001). However, no difference was found in umbilical cord blood adiponectin between the two groups (P = 0.51). A significant positive correlation was found between maternal serum adiponectin in the first day after birth and umbilical cord blood adiponectin in the vaginal delivery group (P = 0.007). Nevertheless, this correlation was not statistically significant in the cesarean delivery group (P = 0.62). There was also no significant correlation between fetal sex and anthropometric measurements with maternal adiponectin (P = 0.44) and umbilical cord blood adiponectin (P = 0.86)., CONCLUSIONS: The result of the current study revealed that maternal adiponectin concentration was significantly higher in vaginal delivery compared to cesarean section, which might be due to the increased levels of maternal adiponectin release during labor.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to comprehensively profile biological factors in pregnancy that have been postulated to be important components of the in utero environment and may also have relevance to later susceptibility to cancer and other chronic diseases., METHODS: Steroid sex hormones, IGFs, and angiogenic factors were measured in maternal and cord serum from term normotensive pregnancies. Spearman correlations and linear regression estimated relationships among the biological factors and clinical characteristics., RESULTS: The analytes were generally not correlated between maternal and fetal circulations. However, significant correlations were demonstrated among several analytes within maternal or cord samples. A few analytes were associated with clinical characteristics (e.g., maternal IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 were inversely correlated with offspring birth weight, while maternal leptin and cord testosterone were positively correlated with this characteristic). Maternal androgens were higher in African-Americans than whites, and maternal PlGF and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) were higher in male than female offspring., CONCLUSIONS: There were significant correlations among analytes, but the patterns differed depending on whether they were measured in the maternal or fetal circulation. The number and magnitude of correlations among analytes, however, should affect the design and interpretation of future studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with preeclampsia demonstrate increases in placental leptin production in midgestation, and an associated increase in late gestation plasma leptin levels. The consequences of mid-late gestation increases in leptin production in pregnancy is unknown. Our previous work indicates that leptin infusion induces endothelial dysfunction in nonpregnant female mice via leptin-mediated aldosterone production and endothelial mineralocorticoid receptor (ECMR) activation, which is ablated by ECMR deletion. Therefore, we hypothesized that leptin infusion in mid-gestation of pregnancy induces endothelial dysfunction and hypertension, hallmarks of clinical preeclampsia, which are prevented by ECMR deletion., METHODS: Leptin was infused via miniosmotic pump (0.9 mg/kg per day) into timed-pregnant ECMR-intact (WT) and littermate-mice with ECMR deletion (KO) on gestation day (GD)11-18., RESULTS: Leptin infusion decreased fetal weight and placental efficiency in WT mice compared with WT+vehicle. Radiotelemetry recording demonstrated that blood pressure increased in leptin-infused WT mice during infusion. Leptin infusion reduced endothelial-dependent relaxation responses to acetylcholine (ACh) in both resistance (second-order mesenteric) and conduit (aorta) vessels in WT pregnant mice. Leptin infusion increased placental ET-1 (endothelin-1) production evidenced by increased PPET-1 (preproendothelin-1) and ECE-1 (endothelin-converting enzyme-1) expressions in WT mice. Adrenal aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) and angiotensin II type 1 receptor b (AT1Rb) expression increased with leptin infusion in pregnant WT mice. KO pregnant mice demonstrated protection from leptin-induced reductions in pup weight, placental efficiency, increased BP, and endothelial dysfunction., CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, these data indicate that leptin infusion in midgestation induces endothelial dysfunction, hypertension, and fetal growth restriction in pregnant mice, which is ablated by ECMR deletion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin is produced mainly by adipocytes. Levels are increased in women with obesity and during pregnancy. Increased levels are also associated with pregnancy complications such as, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes mellitus., OBJECTIVE: We studied what component of body composition correlated best with maternal leptin in the first trimester of pregnancy and, whether maternal leptin correlated better with visceral fat rather than fat distributed elsewhere., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Women were recruited in the first trimester. Maternal adiposity was measured using body mass index and advanced bioelectrical impedance analysis. Maternal leptin was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique., RESULTS: Of the 100 subjects studied, the mean leptin concentration was 37.7 ng/ml (range: 2.1-132.8). Leptin levels did not correlate with gestational age in the first trimester, maternal age, parity or birth weight. Serum leptin correlated positively with maternal weight and body mass index, and with the different parameters of body composition. On multiple regression analysis, serum leptin correlated with visceral fat but not fat distributed elsewhere., CONCLUSIONS: Visceral fat is the main determinant of circulating maternal leptin in the first trimester of pregnancy. This raises the possibility that maternal leptin in early pregnancy may be a marker for the development of metabolic syndrome, including diabetes mellitus.

AB  - The intrauterine environment and early-life nutrition are regulated by maternal biomarkers in the blood and breast milk. We aimed to explore epigenetic modifications that may contribute to differential chemerin expression in maternal plasma, colostrum, and breast milk and find its association with fetal cord blood and infant weight at 6 weeks postpartum. Thirty-three gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) mothers and 33 normoglycemic mothers (NGT) were recruited. Two maternal blood samples (28th week of gestation and 6 weeks postpartum), cord blood, colostrum, and mature milk were collected. Methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were conducted. The weight of the babies was measured at birth and 6 weeks postpartum. Serum chemerin levels at the 28th gestational week and 6 weeks postpartum were significantly lower for the NGT group as compared to the GDM group; (P < 0.05). Higher colostrum chemerin concentrations were observed in the GDM group and remained elevated in mature milk as compared to NGT (P < 0.05). Colostrum and breast milk chemerin levels showed an independent association with infant weight at 6 weeks postpartum (r = 0.270; P = 0.034) (r = 0.464; P < 0.001). Forty percent GDM mothers expressed unmethylated chemerin reflecting increased chemerin concentration in the maternal blood. This pattern was also observed in newborn cord blood where 52% of samples showed unmethylated chemerin in contrast to none in babies born to normoglycemic mothers. The results of this study highlight the critical importance of altered chemerin regulation in gestational diabetic mothers and its effect during early life period and suggest a possible role in contributing to childhood obesity.

AB  - Objective: We aimed to assess the levels of adipokine and their relation to gestational diabetic related clinical phenotypes and fetal growth parameters.Material and methods: International Association of the Diabetes and Pregnancy Study criteria was used to classify gestational diabetic cases (n=208) and euglycemic controls (n=300). ELISA assays were performed for insulin, chemerin, leptin, and interleukin-18 (IL-18). Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-square/Fisher exact test, multiple regression analyses, and ROC curves were applied with significant p values of <0.05.Results: Levels of chemerin, IL-18, and leptin were seven-, four-, and five-folds higher in cases versus controls, respectively (p<0.01). The adipokine showed strong positive correlation with fasting blood glucose, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and fetal weight (p<0.01). Odds of GDM association remained significant for chemerin (OR 1.522; 1.097-2.110) and leptin (OR 2.579; 1.503-4.425) while all associations were lost for IL-18 (p>0.05) after multiple adjustments. Raised chemerin levels were identified in 96% cases (n=201) employing the proposed cut off value>15.49ng/ml.Conclusion: High chemerin and leptin levels are seen in GDM which may be associated with subclinical inflammation suggesting a role in development of insulin resistance.

AB  - Background: Fetal glucocorticoid exposure is associated with later development of features of the metabolic syndrome such as central obesity and insulin resistance. Fat tissue, especially visceral fat, produces adiponectin, which is inversely associated with insulin resistance in older children and adults. Adipocytes also produce leptin, directly related to measures of adiposity. It is unknown how the secretion of these hormones in early childhood is related to pregnancy levels of CRH, a proxy of fetal glucocorticoid exposure. Aim: Our aim was to study the relationship of maternal midpregnancy CRH levels with offspring levels of adiponectin and leptin in early childhood. Methods: The study population consisted of 349 mother-children pairs from Project Viva, a prospective prebirth cohort study from eastern Massachusetts. We created a general linear model with log CRH levels in midpregnancy maternal blood as the predictor and adiponectin and leptin measured in the 3-yr-old offspring as outcomes, adjusting for covariates. Results: The means (SD) of log CRH, adiponectin, and leptin were 4.97 (0.65) log pg/ml, 22.4 (5.8) mu g/ml, and 1.9 (1.8) ng/ml. For each unit increment in log CRH, mean value of offspring adiponectin was 1.10 mu g/ml (95% confidence interval = 0.06-2.14) higher. We found no association with leptin (-0.08 ng/ml; 95% confidence interval = -0.40-0.24). Conclusions: Higher maternal blood levels of CRH were associated with higher levels of adiponectin but unchanged levels of leptin at age 3 yr. The increased adiponectin levels might represent secretion from organs other than fat or reflect a compensatory mechanism to increase insulin sensitivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is compelling evidence that insulin resistance may play a pivotal role in the development of pregnancy complications including pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). As dysregulation of visfatin and adiponectin is found in insulin resistance, both adipokines might contribute to pregnancy disorders., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Plasma levels of visfatin and adiponectin were quantified in second-trimester pregnancies with abnormal uterine perfusion and in third-trimester pregnancies with IUGR as compared to healthy controls., RESULTS: Mean plasma adiponectin levels were significantly increased in women with pathological perfusion (7078 +/- 789 ng/ml) as compared to normal uterine perfusion (4481 +/- 1183 ng/ml) (P < 0.05) whereas visfatin plasma concentrations were not different between these groups. Visfatin levels were significantly elevated in women with IUGR (140.1 +/- 10 ng/ml) as compared to patients with normal outcome (65.5 +/- 11 ng/ml) (P < 0.05). By contrast, adiponectin plasma concentrations were not significantly altered in women with IUGR., CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the view that the adipokines visfatin and adiponectin are differentially regulated in pregnancy complications.

AB  - The goal of this project was to determine the effects of domperidone given throughout lactation on hormonal and metabolic status, lactational performance, and gene expression in mammary epithelial cells of sows. Second parity sows were divided in two treatment groups: 1) daily intramuscular injections with canola oil (Control, CTL, n = 24), or 2) daily intramuscular injections with 0.5 mg/kg body weight (BW) of domperidone (DOMP, n = 23). Injections were given at 08h05 starting the day after farrowing until weaning. Over the first 4 d of treatment, DOMP sows also received 0.5 mg/kg BW of domperidone per os twice daily, whereas CTL sows were fed the vehicle. Litter size was standardized to 11 +/- 1 within 24 h of birth and piglets were weighed at birth, 24 h postpartum, and on days 7, 22 (weaning on day 23), 35, and 56. Sow feed intake was recorded daily. Representative milk samples were obtained aseptically on day 21 of lactation from 15 sows per treatment for compositional analyses and milk fat globules were used to measure mRNA abundances of various genes. Jugular blood samples were obtained from all sows on days 2, 8, 16, and 23 of lactation to measure concentrations of prolactin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), leptin, adiponectin, insulin, glucose, urea, and free fatty acids (FFA). Concentrations of prolactin (P < 0.001) and FFA (P < 0.01) were increased in DOMP compared with CTL sows, whereas concentrations of insulin were decreased (P < 0.05). Urea concentrations were increased by treatment (P < 0.05) on days 16 and 23 of lactation, and those of IGF-1 were increased (P < 0.01) on day 16. Piglets from DOMP sows were heavier than those from CTL sows on day 22 (P < 0.01). Milk composition was unaffected by treatment. The mRNA abundance in milk fat globules for casein beta and whey acidic protein were lower (P >= 0.05) in DOMP than CTL sows. The long form of the prolactin receptor and the signal transducer and activator of transcription 5A mRNA abundances tended to be lower (P < 0.10) in DOMP than CTL sows. In conclusion, hyperprolactinemia induced by domperidone during lactation affected the endocrine and metabolite status of sows and stimulated growth of their suckling piglets.

AB  - As many individuals worlwide are exposed to arsenic, it is necessary to unravel the role of arsenic in the risk of obesity and diabetes. Therefore, the present study reviewed the effects of arsenic exposure on the risk and potential etiologic mechanisms of obesity and diabetes. It has been suggested that inflammation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis contribute to the pathogenesis of arsenic-induced diabetes and obesity. Though arsenic is known to cause diabetes through different mechanisms, the role of adipose tissue in diabetes is still unclear. This review exhibited the effects of arsenic on the metabolism and signaling pathways within adipose tissue (such as sirtuin 3 [SIRT3]- forkhead box O3 [FOXO3a], mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK], phosphoinositide-dependant kinase-1 [PDK-1], unfolded protein response, and C/EBP homologous protein [CHOP10]). Different types of adipokines involved in arsenic-induced diabetes are yet to be elucidated. Arsenic exerts negative effects on the white adipose tissue by decreasing adipogenesis and enhancing lipolysis. Some epidemiological studies have shown that arsenic can promote obesity. Nevertheless, few studies have indicated that arsenic may induce lipodystrophy. Arsenic multifactorial effects include accelerating birth and postnatal weight gains, elevated body fat content, glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, and increased serum lipid profile. Arsenic also elevated cord blood and placental, as well as postnatal serum leptin levels. The data from human studies indicate an association between inorganic arsenic exposure and the risk of diabetes and obesity. However, the currently available evidence is insufficient to conclude that low-moderate dose arsenic is associated with diabetes or obesity development. Therefore, more investigations are needed to determine biological mechanisms linking arsenic exposure to obesity and diabetes. Copyright © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objective: Level of injury (LOI) and the role of adipose tissue and its proinflammatory adipokines in cardiometabolic dysfunction following spinal cord injury (SCI) remains poorly understood. We aim to examine the influence of LOI on adipose tissue and its relationship to proinflammatory adipokines and cardiometabolic profiles following SCI. Design: Cross sectional and correlational study. Setting: Clinical hospital and academic setting. Participants: Forty-seven individuals with chronic motor complete SCI (age 43.8 +/- 11.5 y, BMI: 27.3 +/- 5.3) were classified as having tetraplegia (TSCI; n= 12) or paraplegia (PSCI; n=35). Intervention: Non applicable. Outcome Measures: Visceral (VAT) and subcutaneous (SAT) adipose tissue volumes were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. Proinflammatory adipokines (tumor neurosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasminogen activatable inhibitor-1, thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, and high-sensitivity c-reactive protein) and cardiovascular, carbohydrate, and lipid profiles were assessed according to standard techniques. Results: VAT volume was greater in TSCI versus PSCI (p=0.042); however, after covarying for age this significance was lost (p >0.05). IL-6 was significantly elevated in TSCI (p<0.05), while other markers of inflammation generally were elevated, but did not reach statistical significance (p>0.05). Systolic blood pressure and total cholesterol were significantly lower in TSCI (p<0.05), while fasting glucose was significantly lower in PSCI (p <0.05). A number of proinflammatory adipokines and cardiometabolic markers significantly correlated with adipose tissue depots by LOI (p <0.05). Conclusion: The results show that LOI does not influence the distribution of adipose tissue, but does influence proinflammatory adipokines and cardiometabolic profiles following SCI. Further research is needed to evaluate impact of lean body mass on these findings.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Placental hormones such as resistin, adiponectin, ghrelin and leptin are known to have considerable role in fetal growth and there are some articles published in this area recently. Nevertheless there is a shortage of data showing association between resistin level and fetal growth; that was why we decided to conduct a study to evaluate this association., METHODS: This study was approved by ethic committee of pediatric health research center and research vice chancellor of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences. In this case-control study we measured the insulin, glucose and resistin in the cord blood of neonates with gestational age of 37 weeks or more in Al Zahra tertiary hospital from March 2011 to March 2012. Thirty-nine appropriate for gestation age (AGA) neonates and 41 small for gestation age (SGA) neonates were studied., FINDINGS: The umbilical cord blood resistin level was not found to have significant correlation with the type of delivery [normal vaginal delivery (NVD) or cesarean-section (C-S)], neonate's gender, maternal age or body mass index (BMI). There was no significant difference in the levels of Insulin and glucose between AGA and SGA groups. Resistin level of blood cord in AGA group was 613.76+/-180.10 (range: 132.6-983.80 ng/ml) and in SGA group it was 1303.47+/-537.07 (range: 800.9-3001 ng/ml) (P<0.001). Neonates' weight in AGA group was 3162.82+/-407.92 g and in SGA group it was 2425.85+/-32.84 g (P<0.001)., CONCLUSION: In this study resistin level had reverse correlation with fetal weight in term neonates. The SGA neonates with growth insufficiency have higher resistin levels in their cord blood than AGA neonates with same gestational age. It is recommended to conduct more studies in future with larger population of patients to clarify the resistin role in neonatal birth weight.

AB  - The change in maternal lipid, leptin and adiponectin concentrations during pregnancy and infant birth weight (BW) is still poorly characterized. Thus, the aim of the study was to evaluate the association of maternal lipids, leptin and adiponectin throughout pregnancy with large-for-gestational-age (LGA) births and BW z-score. A prospective cohort of 199 mothers was followed during pregnancy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The statistical analyses comprised multiple logistic and linear regression. Women delivered 36 LGA and 11 small-for-gestational-age newborns. HDL-c rate of change throughout pregnancy was negatively associated with BW z-score (beta = -1.99; p = 0.003) and the delivery of a LGA newborn (OR = 0.02; p = 0.043). Pregnancy baseline concentration of log leptin was positively associated (OR = 3.92; p = 0.025) with LGA births. LDL-c rate of change throughout pregnancy was positively associated with BW z-score (beta = 0.31; p = 0.004). Log triglycerides and log adiponectin were not significantly associated with BW z-score or LGA birth. In conclusion, a higher log leptin pregnancy baseline concentration and a lower HDL-c rate of change during pregnancy were associated with higher odds of having a LGA newborn. These maternal biomarkers are important to foetal growth and could be used in prenatal care as an additional strategy to screen women at risk of inadequate BW.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal smoking has been associated with elevated risk of type 2 diabetes among the offspring in adulthood. The mechanisms underlying this fetal "programming" effect remain unclear. The present study sought to explore whether maternal smoking affects metabolic health biomarkers in fetuses/newborns., METHODS: In a prospective singleton pregnancy cohort (n = 248), we compared metabolic health biomarkers in the newborns of smoking and non-smoking mothers. Outcomes included cord plasma insulin, proinsulin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II, leptin and adiponectin concentrations, glucose-to-insulin ratio (an indicator of insulin sensitivity) and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (an indicator of beta-cell function)., RESULTS: Independent of maternal (glucose tolerance, age, ethnicity, parity, education, body mass index, alcohol use) and infant (sex, gestational age, birth weight z score, mode of delivery, cord blood glucose concentration) characteristics, the newborns of smoking mothers had lower IGF-I concentrations (mean: 6.7 vs. 8.4 nmol/L, adjusted p = 0.006), and marginally higher proinsulin-to-insulin ratios (0.94 vs. 0.72, adjusted p = 0.06) than the newborns of non-smoking mothers. Cord plasma insulin, proinsulin, IGF-II, leptin and adiponectin concentrations and glucose-to-insulin ratios were similar in the newborns of smoking and non-smoking mothers., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal smoking was associated with decreased fetal IGF-I levels, and borderline lower fetal beta-cell function. Larger cohort studies are required to confirm the latter finding. The preliminary findings prompt the hypothesis that these early life metabolic changes may be involved in the impact of maternal smoking on future risk of metabolic syndrome related disorders in the offspring.

AB  - Maternal and perinatal undernutrition affects the lung development of litters and it may produce long-lasting alterations in respiratory health. This can be demonstrated using animal models and epidemiological studies. During pregnancy, maternal diet controls lung development by direct and indirect mechanisms. For sure, food intake and caloric restriction directly influence the whole body maturation and the lung. In addition, the maternal food intake during pregnancy controls mother, placenta, and fetal endocrine systems that regulate nutrient uptake and distribution to the fetus and pulmonary tissue development. There are several hormones involved in metabolic regulations, which may play an essential role in lung development during pregnancy. This review focuses on the effect of metabolic hormones in lung development and in how undernutrition alters the hormonal environment during pregnancy to disrupt normal lung maturation. We explore the role of GLP-1, ghrelin, and leptin, and also retinoids and cholecalciferol as hormones synthetized from diet precursors. Finally, we also address how metabolic hormones altered during pregnancy may affect lung pathophysiology in the adulthood.

AB  - Alterations in a mother's metabolism and endocrine system, due to unbalanced nutrition, may increase the risk of both metabolic and non-metabolic disorders in the offspring's childhood and adulthood. The risk of obesity in the offspring can be determined by the interplay between maternal nutrition and lifestyle, intrauterine environment, epigenetic modifications, and early postnatal factors. Several studies have indicated that the fetal bowel begins to colonize before birth and that, during birth and nursing, the gut microbiota continues to change. The mother's gut microbiota is primarily transferred to the fetus through maternal nutrition and the environment. In this way, it is able to impact the establishment of the early fetal and neonatal microbiome, resulting in epigenetic signatures that can possibly predispose the offspring to the development of obesity in later life. However, antioxidants and exercise in the mother have been shown to improve the offspring's metabolism, with improvements in leptin, triglycerides, adiponectin, and insulin resistance, as well as in the fetal birth weight through epigenetic mechanisms. Therefore, in this extensive literature review, we aimed to investigate the relationship between maternal diet, epigenetics, and gut microbiota in order to expand on current knowledge and identify novel potential preventative strategies for lowering the risk of obesity in children and adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The placental syncytiotrophoblast is the major source of maternal plasma corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) in the second half of pregnancy. Placental CRH exerts multiple functions in the maternal organism: It induces the adrenal secretion of cortisol via the stimulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone, regulates the timing of birth via its actions in the myometrium and inhibits the invasion of extravillous trophoblast cells in vitro. However, the auto- and paracrine actions of CRH on the syncytiotrophoblast itself are unknown. Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is accompanied by an increase in placental CRH, which could be of pathophysiological relevance for the dysregulation in syncytialisation seen in IUGR placentas., METHODS: We aimed to determine the effect of CRH on isolated primary trophoblastic cells in vitro. After CRH stimulation the trophoblast syncytialisation rate was monitored via syncytin-1 gene expression and beta-hCG (beta-human chorionic gonadotropine) ELISA in culture supernatant. The expression of the IUGR marker genes leptin and 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 2 (11beta-HSD2) was measured continuously over a period of 72 h. We hypothesized that CRH might attenuate syncytialisation, induce leptin, and reduce 11beta-HSD2 expression in primary villous trophoblasts, which are known features of IUGR., RESULTS: CRH did not influence the differentiation of isolated trophoblasts into functional syncytium as determined by beta-hCG secretion, albeit inducing syncytin-1 expression. Following syncytialisation, CRH treatment significantly increased leptin and 11beta-HSD2 expression, as well as leptin secretion into culture supernatant after 48 h., CONCLUSION: The relevance of CRH for placental physiology is underlined by the present in vitro study. The induction of leptin and 11beta-HSD2 in the syncytiotrophoblast by CRH might promote fetal nutrient supply and placental corticosteroid metabolism in the phase before labour induction.

AB  - Neonatal protein restriction causes lower body weight and hormonal dysfunctions in 6 months-old rats. In this model, we studied the body composition, glycogen content, serum lipid, serum protein, and hormones related to glucose homeostasis in the offspring during development. At birth, lactating rats were divided into: control darns - fed a normal diet (23% protein) and protein restricted dams - fed a diet with 8 % protein. After weaning, pups received normal diet. Offspring were killed at 21, 90, and 180 days-old. Protein restricted offspring showed lower visceral fat (90th day: 14%; 180th day: 19%) and lower total fat (90th day: 16%; 180th day: 14%) that explain their lower body weight. They presented lower glycemia (I 80th day: 17 %), lower insulinemia (21st day: 63%; 180th day: 24%), higher adiponectinernia (21st day: 169 %), higher liver glycogen (21st day: 104%), and higher muscle glycogen (180th day: 106%), suggesting a higher insulin sensitivity. The higher serum corticosterone (50%), higher adrenal total catecholamines content (98%) as well as in vitro catecholamine secretion (26%) of adult protein restricted offspring, suggest a programming stimulatory effect upon adrenal gland. They also presented several biochemical changes, such as lower serum total protein, albumin and globulin (21st day: 17, 21, 12 %, respectively), higher LDLc (21st day: 69 %), lower triglycericles (21st day: 42 %; 90th day: 39 %), and lower total cholesterol (180th day: 16%). Thus, maternal protein restriction during lactation induces an energy-protein malnutrition, characterized by an impairment of the Pup's protein anabolism and, after weaning, the lower adiposity Suggests lower lipogenesis and higher lipolytic activity, probably caused by catecholamine and glUcocorticoid action.

AB  - OBJECTIVES/GOALS: Infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs) may exhibit decreased oral intake, requiring nasogastric feedings and prolonged hospitalization. We hypothesize that increased insulin exposure and resulting overgrowth in utero disrupts hypothalamic regulation of food intake, correlates to body composition and impacts feeding in IDMs. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: Infants born at 35 weeks gestation to mothers with gestational or type II diabetes (IDM cohort), and normoglycemic mothers (control cohort) were recruited. Infants born to mothers with Type I DM or preeclampsia and with a history of intrauterine growth restriction, opioid exposure, or major congenital anomalies were excluded. Salivary expression of known hunger signaling genes 5AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), Neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R), leptin (LEP), ghrelin (GHRL), proopiomelanocortin (POMC), and adiponectin (ADIPOQ) were quantified using RT-qPCR. Body composition was assessed via skinfold measurements and compared and correlated between cohorts. Feeding outcomes were recorded. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: 23 infants were recruited in each cohort. POMC and AMPK were expressed by 71% and 88% of infants respectively in both cohorts. NPY2R was expressed by 79% and 83% of the diabetic cohort and normoglycemia cohort respectively, while GHRL was expressed by 75% and 79% of the diabetic cohort and normoglycemia cohort, respectively. LEP and ADIPOQ were not reliably expressed in either cohort. Infants with a higher body fat percentage were less likely to express NPY2R (OR= 0.76). There was no significant association between body fat percentage and expression of AMPK, POMC, or GHRL. Only 3 IDMs were noted by providers to exhibit poor oral intake, limiting our ability to correlate gene expression and body composition with feeding outcomes. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Noninvasive assessment of hunger signaling gene expression is possible through salivary analysis of AMPK, POMC, NPY2R, and GHRL. Given the paucity of IDMs with poor feeding in our study, future studies should target IDMs requiring feeding support to understand mechanisms driving aberrant feeding behavior.

AB  - Preterm delivery can be precipitated by preeclampsia or infection, and preterm infants are at heightened risk of postnatal infection. Little is known about the ontogeny of inflammatory biomarkers in extremely preterm infants. We hypothesized that suspected prenatal infection (clinical chorioamnionitis or spontaneous preterm labor) and clinically diagnosed postnatal infection would be associated with unique biomarker signatures, and those patterns would be influenced by the degree of prematurity. Venous blood was collected daily for the first week and weekly for up to 14 additional weeks from 142 neonates born at 22-32 weeks gestation. A custom array was utilized to measure monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were obtained from the electronic medical record. Independent of gestational age, MCP-1 was significantly increased (p < 0.001) in association with maternal preeclampsia, but MCP-1 was decreased (p < 0.01), and CRP was increased (p < 0.01) in the presence of chorioamnionitis with funisitis. IL-6 and CRP were both increased in infants diagnosed with postnatal infection, with peak levels observed on days 2 and 3, respectively. In conclusion, suspected prenatal and postnatal infections and non-infectious complications of pregnancy are associated with unique biomarker profiles, independent of gestational age, including over a 2-fold increase in MCP-1 among newborns of mothers with preeclampsia. Further, in those clinically diagnosed with a postnatal infection in the absence of antenatal infection concerns, IL-6 increases before CRP, emphasizing a potential role for expanded biomarker screening if antibiotics are initially avoided in infants delivered for maternal indications.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Insulin resistance has been linked to intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR); adiponectin is a protein with insulin-sensitizing properties. This study was designed to test whether being born small for gestational age (SGA) has an effect on blood levels of adiponectin and leptin, insulin resistance parameters, and lipid profile in pre-puberty, taking into consideration the severity of IUGR., METHODS: Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, total cholesterol (t-CHOL), high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, low density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoproteins A-1 (Apo A-1), Apo B and Apo E, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), fasting glucose, and insulin (Ins), the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) and anthropometric indices were evaluated in 70 children aged 6-8 years, born appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 35) and SGA (n = 35), matched for age, gender, height, and BMI. SGA children were divided into two subgroups according to the severity of IUGR: SGA<3rd percentile (n = 20), and SGA 3rd-10th percentile (n = 15). They were also subdivided in two subgroups, those with (n = 25) and those without (n = 10) catch-up growth, considering their actual height corrected for mid-parental height., RESULTS: SGA children had higher Ins and HOMA-IR than AGA children (Ins, 42 +/- 23 vs 32 +/- 11 pmol/l; HOMA-IR, 1.30 +/- 0.8 vs 0.92 +/- 0.3; P<0.05). No significant difference in serum leptin was found between the SGA and the AGA groups but adiponectin showed a trend to be higher in SGA children (13.6 +/- 5.7 vs 10.8 +/- 5.9 microg/ml respectively). SGA children without catch-up growth had higher adiponectin (15.6 +/- 8.5 microg/ml, P<0.05) than AGA children. Among the SGA children, the subgroup <3rd percentile had higher Lp(a) than the subgroup 3rd-10th percentile (P<0.05). An independent positive correlation between adiponectin and Lp(a) was observed in SGA children (R = 0.59, P<0.01)., CONCLUSION: SGA children, although more insulin resistant, had similar or higher adiponectin levels than matched AGA children in pre-puberty. The severity of IUGR appears to affect their metabolic profile during childhood.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Adipose tissue development starts in intrauterine life and cytokines are involved in this process. Therefore, understanding the role of cytokines in the fat mass gain of infants is crucial to prevent obesity later in life. Furthermore, recent evidence indicates a sex-specific link between cytokines and adipose tissue development. The objective of this study was to assess sex-specific relationships of cord blood concentrations of the cytokines leptin, zinc-alpha2-glycoprotein (ZAG), and adiponectin with infant adiposity during the first 3 mo of life., METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 104 mother-infant pairs that were selected from a maternity hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Cord blood leptin, ZAG, and adiponectin were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The body composition of the infants was assessed monthly by air displacement plethysmography. A multiple linear regression analysis was conducted with the average fat mass gain from birth to the third month of life as the outcome and cord blood leptin, ZAG, and adiponectin as the variables of interest., RESULTS: Leptin was inversely associated with fat mass gain in the first 3 mo of life (P = 0.003; adjusted R2 = 0.09). There were inverse associations of leptin (P = 0.021), ZAG (P = 0.042), and maternal body mass index (P = 0.04) with fat mass gain in girls (adjusted R2 = 0.29) but fat mass gain in boys was positively associated with gestational age (P = 0.01; adjusted R2 = 0.15)., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study suggest that adiposity programming is sex-specific, which highlights the need to investigate the different metabolic mechanisms that are involved in adipogenesis.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Increased visceral adipose tissue mass is strongly associated to metabolic disorders. Visfatin is a visceral fat adipocytokine. There is epidemiological evidence of a link between a suboptimal gestational environment and a greater propensity to develop metabolic disease in adult life. The objective of this study was to establish whether visfatin concentrations in umbilical cord blood are different in newborns small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA), and large for gestational age (LGA)., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Term newborns from an university medical center were included in the study. A blood sample was taken from the umbilical cord vein of each baby immediately after birth. Visfatin was measured using an enzyme immunoassay in the study population, consisting of 35 subjects in the SGA group, 58 in the AGA group, and 35 in the LGA group., RESULTS: Cord blood visfatin concentrations were not different in the three groups, with respective values of 2.78 (1.86-4.49) ng/mL, 3.28 (1.98-4.97) ng/mL, and 3.46 (2.48-5.38) ng/mL in the SGA, AGA and LGA groups (p=0.141). Gestational weight gain (GWG) (14.09+/-6.37kg) was negatively associated to visfatin levels (r=-0.218, p=0.036). GWG is an independent predictor of visfatin concentrations (r2=-0.067, p=0.027)., CONCLUSIONS: There were no differences in cord blood visfatin concentrations depending on birth weight. GWG is an independent predictor of visfatin levels in the cord blood of term newborns. Copyright © 2018 SEEN y SED. Publicado por Elsevier Espana, S.L.U. All rights reserved.

AB  - It is well known that adipokines are endocrine factors that are mainly secreted by white adipose tissue. Their central role in energy metabolism is currently accepted. More recently, their involvement in fertility regulation and the development of some reproductive disorders has been suggested. Data concerning the role of leptin and adiponectin, the two most studied adipokines, in the control of the reproductive axis are consistent. In recent years, interest has grown about some novel adipokines, chemerin, visfatin, resistin and apelin, which have been found to be strongly associated with obesity and insulin-resistance. Here, we will review their expression and role in male and female reproduction in humans and animal models. According to accumulating evidence, they could regulate the secretion of GnRH (Gonadotropin-Releasing Hormone), gonadotropins and steroids. Furthermore, their expression and that of their receptors (if known), has been demonstrated in the human and animal hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis. Like leptin and adiponectin, these novel adipokines could thus represent metabolic sensors that are able to regulate reproductive functions according to energy balance changes. Therefore, after investigating their role in normal fertility, we will also discuss their possible involvement in some reproductive troubles known to be associated with features of metabolic syndrome, such as polycystic ovary syndrome, gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia and intra-uterine growth retardation in women, and sperm abnormalities and testicular pathologies in men.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate associations of maternal gestational weight gain and body composition and their impact on offspring body composition and adipocytokine, glucose, and insulin concentrations at age 4 months., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a prospective study including 31 mother-infant pairs (N = 62). Maternal body composition was assessed using doubly labeled water. Infant body composition was assessed at 4 months using air displacement plethysmography, and venous blood was assayed for glucose, insulin, adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and leptin concentrations., RESULTS: Rate of gestational weight gain in midpregnancy was significantly associated with infant fat mass (r = 0.41, P = 0.03); rate of gestational weight in late pregnancy was significantly associated with infant fat-free mass (r = 0.37, P = 0.04). Infant birth weight was also strongly correlated with infant fat-free mass at 4 months (r = 0.63, P = 0.0002). Maternal BMI and maternal fat mass were strongly inversely associated with infant IL-6 concentrations (r = -0.60, P = 0.002 and r = -0.52, P = 0.01, respectively). Infant fat-free mass was inversely related to infant adiponectin concentrations (r = -0.48, P = 0.008) and positively correlated with infant blood glucose adjusted for insulin concentrations (r = 0.42, P = 0.04). No significant associations for leptin were observed., CONCLUSIONS: Timing of maternal weight gain differentially impacts body composition of the 4-month-old infant, which in turn appears to affect the infant's glucose and adipokine concentrations.

AB  - The present study was carried out to investigate leptin levels in arterial and venous cord serum and in amniotic fluid in full-term infants at birth and on the 5th postnatal day to define the relationship of leptin to intrauterine growth rate, gender and early postnatal life. The relation of weight gain to serum leptin levels in male preterm infants was determined measuring leptin concentration weekly in the first 5 postnatal weeks. Testosterone levels were determined simultaneously to explore a possible relationship between leptin and testosterone concentrations. Fifty-three term newborn infants with mean birth weight and gestational age of 3,419 g (range 2,150-4,480) and 38.9 weeks (range 36-41) and 19 preterm male infants (mean birth weight and gestational age were 1,416 g (770-1,800) and 30.2 weeks (26-35) were enrolled into the study. Leptin and testosterone levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. It was demonstrated that serum leptin levels were markedly elevated in the cord blood without discernible arteriovenous differences. Cord blood leptin was found to correlate with birth weight (r = 0.40, p < 0.002), weight to length ratio (r = 0.40, p < 0.002) and body mass index (r = 0.35, p < 0.005). It was significantly lower in boys as opposed to girls (p < 0.01) and there was an apparent fall by the 5th postnatal day (p < 0.001). Amniotic fluid contained leptin in much less concentration than cord blood and it proved to be independent of intrauterine growth or gender. Serum leptin concentration in preterm infants at 1 week of age was significantly lower compared with term infants (p < 0.002) and it increased progressively with age (p < 0.01). An inverse relationship was found between leptin and testosterone level (r = -0.358, p < 0.01) and a positive correlation between leptin level and weight/height ratio (r = 0.674, p < 0.01). It is concluded that leptin derived either from placenta or fetal adipose tissue may be involved in regulating fetal growth and development and it may be related to energy intake, storage and expenditure. In preterm male infants serum leptin concentration increases with postnatal weight and testosterone may suppress leptin synthesis.

AB  - The authors aimed to compare the maternal serum level and placental expression of resistin in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia and clarify their relationship with disease severity. This cross-sectional study included 50 healthy pregnant women, 50 women with mild preeclampsia, and 48 women with severe preeclampsia. Serum resistin levels were measured by enzyme immunoassay and placental resistin expression was determined by immunohistochemistry. Resistin levels were significantly higher in women with mild and severe preeclampsia than in the healthy controls (p = 0.012 andp < 0.001, respectively). Placental resistin expression was significantly higher in women with severe preeclampsia compared to women with mild preeclampsia (p = 0.003) and healthy controls (p < 0.001). Serum resistin levels were positively correlated with gestational age and umbilical and uterine artery Doppler indices, as well as systolic and diastolic blood pressure, but negatively correlated with birth weight (p < 0.05). On the other hand, placental resistin expression was positively correlated with systolic blood pressure and uterine artery indices, but negatively correlated with birth weight (p < 0.05). In conclusion, increased cir- culating levels and placental expression of resistin in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia were correlated with disease severity.

AB  - Objectives: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of maternal high folic acid (FA) supplementation during pregnancy on glucose intolerance in dams and insulin resistance in offspring. Methods: Wistar female rats (n=18) were mated and randomly divided into 3 groups: a control group and 2 experimental groups. Three different feeding protocols were administered during pregnancy: control group, 2 mg/kg FA (recommended level FA supplementation); experimental 1 group, 5 mg/kg FA (tolerable upper intake level of FA supplementation [ULFolS]); and experimental 2 group, 40 mg/kg FA (high FA supplementation [HfolS]). All dams were fed the same FA content diet (2 mg/kg FA) during the lactation period. An oral glucose tolerance test was performed on day 16 of pregnancy. After the lactation period, body weight and food intake of 36 pups were monitored. Dams were euthanized at the end of the lactation period and half of the pups were euthanized at the end of week 7 and the others at the end of week 12. Serum FA, homocysteine, vitamin B12, insulin, glucose, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, glycated hemoglobin (A1C), and adiponectin levels of mothers and pups were evaluated. The homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) was used to determine insulin resistance in dams and offspring.Results: According to glucose tolerance test results of dams, blood glucose values at minutes 0, 60, 90, and 120 for the HFolS group were significantly higher compared with the control group (p<0.05). The A1C level in HFolS dams was significantly higher than in the control group (p<0.05). The mean birthweight of the pups in the HFolS group was significantly higher than that of control pups (p<0.05). HOMA-IR values for control and HFolS offspring were similar at weeks 7 and 12 and higher than in ULFolS offspring (p>0.05).Conclusions: It was determined that high doses of FA exposure during pregnancy might be effective in the development of glucose intolerance in dams and insulin resistance in offspring in this study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the association in humans between maternal psychosocial stress exposure during pregnancy and measures of glucose-insulin metabolism in the adult offspring., STUDY DESIGN: Healthy young adults whose mothers experienced major stressful life events during their pregnancy (n = 36, prenatal stress, PS group, mean age 25 +/- 5.14 [SD] years) and a comparison group (n = 22, CG, mean age 24 +/- 3.7 [SD] years) underwent an oral glucose tolerance test., RESULTS: Glucose levels were not significantly different across the groups; however, prenatally stressed subjects showed significantly elevated 2-hour insulin (P = .01) and C-peptide levels (P = .03). These differences were independent of other major risk factors for insulin resistance, including birth phenotype (birthweight, length of gestation), a family history of diabetes, gestational diabetes, body mass index, proinflammatory state, and smoking., CONCLUSION: Higher insulin responses reflect relative insulin resistance in these prenatally stressed young adults. This study is the first to provide evidence for a link in humans between prenatal psychosocial stress exposure and alterations in glucose-insulin metabolic function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We sought to determine whether prenatal supplementation with the omega-3 fatty acids eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) would increase markers of insulin sensitivity in maternal or cord blood compared with placebo supplementation. A secondary aim was to evaluate the association of serum EPA and DHA fractions with adiponectin, leptin and the adiponectin:leptin ratio (ALR). We hypothesized that omega-3 fatty acid supplementation would increase markers of insulin sensitivity in maternal and umbilical cord plasma., METHODS: We analyzed stored plasma samples collected from a prior 3-arm prospective, double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in which 126 women with singleton pregnancies between 12- and 20-weeks' gestation were randomized to receive: 1) an EPA-rich fish oil supplement, 2) a DHA-rich fish oil supplement, or 3) a soy oil placebo. Maternal venous blood samples were collected at 12-20 weeks gestation (before supplementation) and at 34-36 weeks gestation. At delivery, cord blood was collected. Samples were analyzed using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits to quantify leptin and adiponectin levels which were utilized to calculate the ALR, a proxy measure for insulin sensitivity., RESULTS: We found no difference in adiponectin, leptin, and the ALR between the treatment and placebo groups at baseline, after supplementation, or in umbilical cord blood. In regression analyses, higher maternal serum DHA fraction was associated with increased ALR before (p = 0.01) and after (p = 0.04) DHA supplementation. There was no association of EPA fraction with any measure of insulin sensitivity. Cord blood DHA fraction was significantly associated with cord plasma leptin (p = 0.02). Early pregnancy BMI was significantly associated with maternal leptin levels at baseline and in late pregnancy (p < 0.001) and was inversely associated with the ALR (p < 0.001). The ALR decreased significantly between the early and late pregnancy visits (p < 0.001). Pregnancy weight gain was inversely associated with the ALR (P. < 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: EPA- and DHA- rich fish oil supplementation had no effect on plasma markers of insulin sensitivity. However, maternal serum DHA fraction was significantly associated with markers of insulin sensitivity., TRIAL REGISTRATION: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, registration number NCT00711971, 7/7/2008.

AB  - Low birth weight (LBW) is a health concern in developing countries. Leptin and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) are factors that influence LBW. A case-control study was conducted at Medani hospital, Sudan. Cases were women who had LBW deliveries ( 2,500 g) and controls were women with normal-weight babies ( 2.500 - 4,000 g). Sociodemographic and obstetrical characteristics were gathered from both groups and leptin and IGF-I levels were measured by ELISA. Cases and controls (45 in each arm) were matched in their basic data. The median (interquartile) of maternal leptin levels [9.9 (1.9 - 21.8) vs. 16.0 (9.6 - 20.8), ng/ml; P0.001] and IGF-I [1.6 (0.7 - 20.0) vs. 6.1 (4.3 - 7.1) ng/ml ; P 0.001] were significantly lower in cases than in controls. Likewise, cord serum leptin [5.8 (2.1 - 12.6) vs. 20.0 (5.1 - 37.8) ng/ml; P0.001] and cord serum IGF-I [1.7 (1.3 - 2.0) vs. 6.9 (5.9 - 7.4) ng/ml; P0.001] levels were significantly lower in cases than in controls. Significant positive correlation was found between birth weight and cord leptin ( r0.398), maternal ( r0.795) and cord ( r0.863) IGF-I levels. Maternal and cord leptin and IGF-I levels were significantly lower in LBW babies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonates with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) have a high lipid profile that predisposes them to cardiovascular disease later in life. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omega 3 supplementation on serum leptin level, lipid profile, and growth in neonates with IUGR., METHODS: This clinical trial was conducted on 70 full-term neonates with IUGR. Neonates were randomly divided into two equal groups; the treatment group: received omega 3 supplement (40 mg/kg/day) for 2 weeks after the establishment of full feeding, and the control group, who were followed up to full feeding without any supplementation. Serum leptin level, total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), triglycerides (TG), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and anthropometric measurement were evaluated at admission and after 2 weeks of omega 3 supplementation in both groups., RESULTS: After treatment, HDL significantly increased, unlike TC, TG, LDL, LDL, and serum leptin levels, which significantly decreased in the treatment group compared to the control group after treatment. Interestingly, weight, length, and ponderal index greatly increased in omega 3-treated neonates compared to the control group., CONCLUSION: Omega 3 supplementations lowered serum leptin level, TG, TC, LDL, and VLDL but increased HDL and growth in neonates with IUGR., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT05242107)., IMPACT: Neonates with intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) were reported to have a high lipid profile that predisposes them to cardiovascular disease later in life. Leptin is a hormone that adjusts dietary intake and body mass and has a significant role in fetal development. Omega 3 is known to be essential for neonatal growth and brain development. We aimed to evaluate the effect of omega 3 supplementation on serum leptin level, lipid profile, and growth in neonates with IUGR. We found that omega 3 supplementations lowered serum leptin level and serum lipid profile but increased high density lipoprotein and growth in neonates with IUGR. Copyright © 2023. The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) occurs in one to three per 1000 live full-term births. Fifteen to twenty percent will die in the postnatal period, and an additional 25 % will develop severe and permanent neuropsychological sequalae. The control of growth and nutritional status in the fetus and neonate is a complex mechanism, in which also hormones produced by adipose tissue, such as adiponectin and leptin are involved. The aim of this study was to measure the levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin in neonates with HIE at birth and in early postnatal life and comparing them with normal healthy AGA and SGA neonates., METHODS: This study carried out on 80 full-term neonates born in Minia university hospital during the period from May 2013 to December 2014. They were divided into group I included 25 neonates with HIE and group II included 55 normal healthy neonates (30 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and 25 small for gestational age (SGA)). Weight, length, head circumference, body mass index (BMI), glucose, adiponectin, leptin and insulin levels were measured for all neonates. Adiponectin, leptin and insulin levels were compared between neonates with HIE and normal healthy neonates as well as between AGA and SGA neonates at birth, 2nd and 6th days of life., RESULTS: Adiponectin and leptin levels were significantly higher at birth then began to decrease during the first postnatal week in all neonates while insulin level increased during the same period. Serum adiponectin levels were significantly lower while serum leptin and insulin levels were significantly higher in neonates with HIE than healthy neonates. In all neonates, the serum adiponectin level was positively correlated at birth with weight, length, BMI and leptin levels but not with insulin level. In neonates with HIE, serum adiponectin level was not correlated with weight, BMI, leptin level or insulin level. In all neonates, the serum leptin level was positively correlated at birth with body weight, height and BMI. In neonates with HIE serum leptin levels were not correlated with weight, BMI or insulin level after birth. There were no correlations between either leptin or adiponectin serum levels or any of the studied parameters in neonates with HIE., CONCLUSIONS: Neonates who are suffering from HIE had lower serum levels of adiponectin and higher serum levels of leptin and insulin than normal healthy neonates at birth and during the early postnatal period. The decline of leptin and increased the insulin levels after birth in all neonates may be important for the stimulation of feeding behavior and the acquisition of energy homeostasis during the early postnatal life. Positive significant correlations between adiponectin, leptin, body weight and body mass indices were present in normal healthy neonates but not in neonates with HIE reflecting the effect of hypoxia on the regulatory mechanisms controlling the adipose tissue functions.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of daily movements on weight gain, serum leptin, and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) in premature infants., STUDY DESIGN: Twenty very-low-birth-weight premature infants were matched and randomized to a daily movement (n = 10) and control groups (n = 10). Daily movement consisted of passive range of motion with gentle compression of both the upper and lower extremities 5 days per week for 4 weeks., RESULTS: Daily movements led to a significant increase in weight gain (784 +/- 51 vs 608 +/- 26 g in movements and controls, respectively, p < 0.02), and to a significant increase in leptin (0.60 +/- 0.19 vs 0.13 +/- 0.06 ng/ml in movements and controls, respectively 18.8 +/- 4.1 vs 9.2 +/- 4.1 ng/ml in movements and controls, respectively); however, this increase was not statistically significant., CONCLUSION: A relatively brief range of motion daily movement intervention was associated with greater weight gain and increased leptin levels in very-low-birth-weight premature infants. This may suggest that at least part of the daily movements associated with increase in body weight resulted from an increase in adipose tissue.

AB  - CONTEXT: Vitamin D has been variably implicated in risk of developing type 1 diabetes based on cohorts of at-risk individuals. Emergent type 1 diabetes in childhood is putatively preceded by altered growth., OBJECTIVE: We explored whether polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism genes modify risk of type 1 diabetes via effects on growth in a prospective, population-based cohort of infants., METHODS: The Cambridge Baby Growth Study enrolled newborns from Cambridgeshire, UK, for follow-up in infancy. In 612 infants, we genotyped single nucleotide polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism genes that relate with type 1 diabetes: rs10741657 and rs12794714 in CYP2R1, rs12785878 in DHCR7, and rs10877012 in CYP27B1. Multivariate linear regression analyses tested associations between genotypes and anthropometric indices (weight, length, and skinfold thickness) or growth-related hormones (C-peptide, IGF-1, and leptin) in infancy., RESULTS: Birth weight showed borderline associations with the diabetes risk-increasing alleles in CYP2R1, rs10741657 (beta = -.11, P = .02) and rs12794714 (beta = -.09, P = .04). The risk-increasing allele rs12794714 was also associated with higher IGF-1 levels at age 24 months (beta = .30, P = .01). At age 3 months, the risk-increasing allele rs12785878 in DHCR7, known to negatively associate with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels, showed a positive association with leptin levels (beta = .23, P = .009), which was pronounced in girls (P = .004) vs boys (P = .7)., CONCLUSION: The vitamin D metabolism genes DHCR7 and CYP2R1 might influence infancy leptin and IGF-1 levels respectively. These findings open the possibility for a developmental role of vitamin D that is mediated by growth-related hormones with implications for the onset of type 1 diabetes autoimmunity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Visfatin is a hormone discovered in fat cells and is directly related to diabetes. We aimed to investigate the relationship between intrauterine growth pattern and serum visfatin concentrations in full-term infants at birth and at 6 months of life., METHODS: Cord blood visfatin concentrations were assessed in 90 full-term neonates enrolled into; Group I: 30 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates to healthy mothers, Group II: 30 intra-uterine growth restricted (IUGR) neonates, 19 were born to mothers with pre-eclampsia, Group III: 30 large for gestational age (LGA) neonates, 16 were infants of diabetic mothers (IDMs). Neonates were followed up at six months of age for visfatin concentrations., RESULTS: Cord blood visfatin concentrations were increased in IUGR compared to AGA group (p = 0.002). Cord blood visfatin concentrations were increased in LGA compared to AGA and IUGR groups (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Cord blood visfatin concentrations were positively correlated to birth weight in AGA, LGA groups (r = 0.39, p = 0.045, r = 0.449, p = 0.013 respectively). Visfatin concentrations in neonates born to mothers with pre-eclampsia and IDMs were higher than in those born to mothers without pre-eclampsia and to non-diabetic mothers (p = 0.040, p = 0.002 respectively). At six months, serum visfatin concentrations decreased compared to cord blood visfatin concentrations in IUGR and LGA groups (p < 0.001). Levels in LGA were still higher than IUGR (p = 0.004). Serum visfatin concentrations were positively correlated to cord visfatin in IUGR neonates (r = 0.497, p = 0.005)., CONCLUSION: Cord blood visfatin concentrations were increased in LGA and IUGR neonates. At six months, serum visfatin concentrations decreased compared to cord blood visfatin concentrations in LGA and IUGR groups, still higher in the former than the latter.

AB  - Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as glucose intolerance detected during pregnancy. GDM is increasing worldwide and is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. Neuregulin 4 (NGR4) is epidermal growth factor like signaling molecule. It plays an important role in cell to cell communication furthermore recent studies indicate that NRG4 may work as a novel adipokine with a possible role in maintaining energy and metabolic homeostasis. The aim of the present study was to assess serum NRG4 levels along with several metabolic parameters in patients diagnosed with gestational diabetic mellitus.Materials and methods: In this prospective cross-sectional study, the study group was composed of 63 women with GDM and 64 healthy pregnant women matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and gestational age. Blood samples were collected at the 24-28th gestational weeks. Serum NRG4, total cholesterol, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides, glucose levels during 75-gr OGTT, fasting insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and creatinine levels were measured. Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) values were calculated.Results: Serum NRG4 values were significantly elevated in the GDM group compared to the control group (p<.001). Multivariate linear regression analyzes revealed that BMI (=0.910, p<.001), glucose 2-h OGTT (=0.866, p<.001) and HOMA-IR (=0.222, p<.001) independently and positively predicted NRG4 levels.Conclusions: Serum NRG4 levels were associated with metabolic parameters of GDM. The present study can be considered to be a guide for future studies to clarify the pathophysiology of NGR4 in GDM patients.

AB  - Introduction and Aim: Pregnancy is a physiological state to sustain the developing fetus accompanied with high-energy demand and an increased oxygen requirement, associated with diverse metabolic and vascular changes in the maternal system. Oxygen is crucial for the proper proliferation and differentiation of trophoblast, the principal cells of the transient organ placenta. Placental hypoxia/ischemia results in the dysregulation in the physiological and metabolic activities of trophoblast. Readily available, cost-effective pharmacological herbal preparation betle leaf may be helpful in the development of novel therapeutic interventions to manage the maternal complication like hypertension and fetal growth restrictions resulting in low-birth-weight babies. This has raised the concern to ascertain the ascendancy of salivary and diastase extracts of betle leaf on the expression of leptin, adiponectin and CYP19A1 in placental trophoblast metabolism. Methodology: Subjecting the placental trophoblast to in vitro hypoxia may highlight the crucial role of oxygen and impact of betle leaf extracts in altering the various metabolic markers. Result(s): Both the extracts modulate the levels of leptin, adiponectin and CYP19A1in regulating energy metabolism and oxidation process. Conclusion(s): This study also suggests that differential expression leptin, adiponectin and CYP19A1, influences this energy imbalance in response to the stress stimuli such as the hypoxia and its relationship with feto-placental metabolism and fetal growth. The ascendancy of betle leaf extracts on the metabolism of trophoblasts requires sufficient oxygen is inferred from the in vitro hypoxic study.Copyright © 2021, Indian Association of Biomedical Scientists.

AB  - Background: Betle leaf (BL) is an ancient herb with a potential nontoxic natural antioxidant efficacy. Oral intake and chewing betel leaves have an effort on the moving parts of salivary gland and induce salivation and detoxification; hence plays a vital role in oral hygiene. BL produces and activates various salivary enzymes which include alpha-amylase, lipase, lysozyme, and lactoperoxidase. BL possess antibacterial, antioxidant, anti-diabetic, immunomodulatory, and antihypertensive properties. Hence, it can be effective in the treatment of hypertensive disorder of pregnancy like preeclampsia (PE). Objective(s): In this context, two extracts of BL (Salivary BL extract [SBLE] and diastase BL extract [DBLE]), proved to impart efficient radical scavenging activity in our previous research work were utilized to analyze their efficacy on the level of 4-hydroxy nonenal (4-HNE), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), adiponectin/leptin in the trophoblast isolated from placental tissue of both normotensive and preeclamptic patients. Material(s) and Method(s): Trophoblasts were isolated from both subjects and incubated with different extracts of Piper betle (saliva and diastase) to assess the cellular stress in placental trophoblast during PE. Result(s): Results demonstrate that extracts of BL exhibit a significant role in regulating 4-HNE, ADMA, leptin, HO-1, and adiponectin in preeclamptic trophoblasts. Still, SBLE showed relatively higher efficiency in defining the level of 4-HNE, ADMA, leptin, HO-1, and adiponectin in preeclamptic trophoblasts than DBLE, suggesting that it may be attributed to the interaction of the phytochemicals present in BL with the components of saliva. Conclusion(s): Hence, BL may be recommended as the effective natural remedy in the management of pathological complications of PE; which may preclude low birthweight babies and ensure live fetal delivery.Copyright © 2019 Pharmacognosy Research Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lipocalin-2 (LCN-2) has been identified as an osteoblast-secreted hormone regulating immunity, inflammation and metabolic homeostasis and has emerged as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker for acute kidney injury in neonates. We investigated the impact of fetal growth on antepartum maternal serum, cord serum and breast milk LCN-2 concentrations and the associations of the latter with perinatal parameters., METHODS: Maternal serum, cord serum and breast milk LCN-2 concentrations were measured by ELISA in samples from 80 mothers who delivered 40 appropriate (AGA), 20 large for gestational age (LGA) and 20 intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) neonates, classified by customized weight centiles. LCN-2 concentrations were associated with birth weight, customized centile, gender, maternal age and delivery mode., RESULTS: Antepartum maternal serum LCN-2 concentrations were significantly higher in women delivering AGA infants compared to the other two groups. Cord blood LCN-2 concentrations were significantly higher compared to maternal ones; furthermore, they were significantly elevated in the IUGR group compared to the LGA one (p = .019). Lowest concentrations were detected in breast milk, which did not differ between the three growth groups. A negative correlation was documented between cord blood LCN-2 concentrations and customized centiles (r: -0.304, p = .007)., CONCLUSIONS: The higher cord serum LCN-2 concentrations, compared to maternal ones, may point to its fetal origin and potential role in intrauterine growth. The negative correlation of cord LCN-2 concentrations with customized centiles, possibly implies reduced nephron endowment/subclinical kidney damage in IUGR neonates. The extremely low LCN-2 breast milk concentrations could imply that the secretion of LCN-2 from maternal circulation to breast milk is not influenced by factors leading to intrauterine growth pathology.

AB  - While nutrition during pregnancy is critical for the health of both mother and child, little is known about the diet quality of women during pregnancy, its correlation with gestational weight gain (GWG)/body composition, and chosen maternal adipokines. Therefore, we evaluated the Healthy Eating Index (HEI) of 110 pregnant women and analyzed its correlation with GWG/body composition, physical activity, leptin, resistin, adiponectin, and interleukin 6 (IL-6), respectively. Diet quality was medium in 63% of women, characterized by a high intake of animal-based products. HEI was negatively influenced by pre-pregnancy obesity (beta = -0.335, p = 0.004), and positively influenced by higher age (>35 yrs., beta = 0.365, p <= 0.001), upper arm circumference (beta = 0.222, p = 0.052), and total activity during the third trimester (beta = 0.258, p = 0.008). GWG was associated with pre-pregnancy obesity (beta = -0.512, p <= 0.001), thigh circumference (beta = 0.342, p = 0.007), upper arm fat area (beta = 0.208, p = 0.092), and maternal age group (>35 yrs. beta = -0.166, p = 0.082), but not with HEI. Leptin and IL-6 displayed associations with variables representative of body composition, such as pre-pregnancy BMI, thigh circumference, upper arm fat area, and upper arm circumference, but were not influenced by HEI. Neither were adiponectin and resistin. IL-6 was also associated with total activity. In conclusion, GWG, leptin, and IL-6 were influenced by nutritional status (body composition/pre-pregnancy BMI), not by maternal diet. Physical activity level also had an impact on IL-6. Thus, efforts should be intensified to improve diet quality and participation in sports before and during pregnancy, particularly in overweight or obese women.

AB  - Aims: Adipose tissue-secreted proteins, i.e. adipocytokines, have been identified as potential mediators linking fat mass and adipose tissue dysfunction with impaired glucose homeostasis, alterations in the inflammatory status, and risk of diabetes. The aim of this study was to determine whether seven circulating adipocytokines are associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) or are altered by metabolic and weight changes during pregnancy itself. Methods: A panel of seven adipocytokines (i.e. adiponectin, adipocyte fatty acid-binding protein, chemerin, leptin, Pro-Enkephalin, progranulin, and Pro-Neurotensin) was quantified in serum in a cross-sectional cohort of 222 women with the following three groups matched for age and body mass index: (i) 74 pregnant women with GDM; (ii) 74 pregnant women without GDM; and (iii) 74 non-pregnant and healthy women. A stepwise statistical approach was used by performing pairwise comparisons, principal component analysis (PCA), and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). Results: Five out of seven adipocytokines were dysregulated between pregnant and non-pregnant women, i.e. adiponectin, chemerin, leptin, Pro-Enkephalin, and progranulin. None of the adipocytokines significantly differed between GDM and non-GDM status during pregnancy. The same five adipocytokines clustered in a principal component representing pregnancy-induced effects. Fasting insulin was the most relevant parameter in the discrimination of GDM as compared to pregnant women without GDM, whereas chemerin and adiponectin were most relevant factors to discriminate pregnancy status. Conclusions: Pregnancy status but not presence of GDM can be distinguished by the seven investigated adipocytokines in discrimination analyses.

AB  - The placenta exchanges nutrients between the mother and the fetus and requires a constant abundant energy supply. Adiponectin (a cytokine produced primarily by adipose tissue) controls glucose and lipid homeostasis. It is well-known that maternal serum adiponectin levels are inversely related to birth weight, suggesting that adiponectin has a negative effect on fetal growth. This effect appears to be related to the control of nutrient transporters in human placenta. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not yet been characterized. In the present work, we studied adiponectin's direct effect on human primary cytotrophoblasts from first-trimester placenta. Our result showed that in placental cells, adiponectin 1) inhibits the expression of the major glucose transporters (GLUT1 and GLUT12) and sodium-coupled neutral amino acid transporters (SNAT1, SNAT2, and SNAT4), 2) enhances total ATP production but decreases lactate production, 3) inhibits mitochondrial biogenesis and function, and 4) stimulates cell death by enhancing the expression of the pro-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2)-associated X protein (BAX) and tumor protein P53 (TP53) gene expression and inducing the caspase activity. Small-interfering RNA mediating the down-regulation of adiponectin receptors (ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2) was used to demonstrate that adiponectin effects on placental nutrient transport and apoptosis seemed to be essentially mediated by these specific receptors. Taken as a whole, these results strongly suggest that adiponectin regulates human placental function by limiting nutrient transporter expression and inducing apoptosis. These findings may help us to better understand adiponectin's role in placental pathologies such as intrauterine growth restriction, which is characterized by fetal weight loss and drastic apoptosis of placental cells.

AB  - Poor prenatal development, followed by rapid childhood growth, conveys greater cardiometabolic risk in later life. Microswine offspring exposed to perinatal maternal protein restriction [MPR; "low protein offspring" (LPO)] grow poorly in late-fetal/neonatal stages. After weaning to an ad libitum (AL) diet, LPO-AL exhibit accelerated growth and fat deposition rates with low adiponectin mRNA, despite low-normal body fat and small intra-abdominal adipocytes. We examined effects of caloric restriction (CR) on growth and metabolic status in LPO and normal protein offspring (NPO) randomized to AL or CR diets from weaning. CR transiently reduced growth in both LPO and NPO, delaying recovery in female LPO-CR. Over 7.5-12.5 weeks, linear growth rates in LPO-CR were slower than LPO-AL (P < 0.001) but exceeded NPO-AL; body weight growth rates fell but were lower in LPO-CR versus NPO-CR. Linear acceleration ceased after 12 weeks. At 16 weeks, percent catch-up in LPO-CR was reduced versus LPO-AL (P < 0.001). Plasma growth hormone was low in LPO (P < 0.02). CR normalized fat deposition rate, yet adiponectin mRNA remained low in LPO-CR (P < 0.001); plasma adiponectin was low in all LPO-AL and in female LPO-CR. Insulin sensitivity improved during CR. We conclude that in LPO: 1) CR delays onset of, but does not abolish, accelerated linear growth, despite low growth hormone; 2) CR yields stunting via delayed onset, plus a finite window for linear growth acceleration; 3) MPR lowers adiponectin mRNA independently of growth, adiposity, or adipocyte size; and 4) MPR reduces circulating adiponectin in LPO-AL and female LPO-CR, potentially enhancing cardiometabolic risk.

AB  - Adipose tissue (AT) dysfunction links obesity of any cause with cardiometabolic disease, but whether early-life nutritional deficiency can program adipocyte dysfunction independently of obesity is untested. In 3-5-month-old juvenile microswine offspring exposed to isocaloric perinatal maternal protein restriction (MPR) and exhibiting accelerated prepubertal fat accrual without obesity, we assessed markers of acquired obesity: adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels and adipocyte size in intra-abdominal (ABD-AT) and subcutaneous (SC-AT) adipose tissues. Plasma cortisol, leptin and insulin levels were measured in fetal, neonatal and juvenile offspring. In juvenile low-protein offspring (LPO), adipocyte size in ABD-AT was reduced 22% (P = 0.011 v. controls), whereas adipocyte size in SC-AT was increased in female LPO (P = 0.05) and normal in male LPO; yet, adiponectin mRNA in LPO was low in both sexes and in both depots (P < 0.001). Plasma leptin (P = 0.004) and cortisol (P < 0.05) were reduced only in neonatal LPO during MPR. In juveniles, correlations between % body fat and adiponectin mRNA, TNF-alpha mRNA or plasma leptin were significant in normal-protein offspring (NPO) but absent in LPO. Plasma glucose in juvenile LPO was increased in males but decreased in females (interaction, P = 0.023); plasma insulin levels and insulin sensitivity were unaffected. Findings support nutritional programming of adipocyte size and gene expression and subtly altered glucose homeostasis. Reduced adiponectin mRNA and adipokine dysregulation in juvenile LPO following accelerated growth occurred independently of obesity, adipocyte hypertrophy or inflammatory markers; thus, perinatal MPR and/or growth acceleration can alter adipocyte structure and disturb adipokine homeostasis in metabolically adverse patterns predictive of enhanced disease risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin and adiponectin, which are considered to take part in the regulation of energy metabolism, have been found in breast milk and cord blood. The aims of this study were to determine ghrelin and adiponectin levels in colostrum, cord blood and maternal serum and to investigate the correlations between colostrum and cord blood levels of these peptides and the anthropometry of newborn infants and their mothers., METHODS: Total ghrelin (TGHR), free ghrelin (FGHR) and adiponectin levels were studied in colostrum and the serum samples of 25 healthy lactating women and the cord blood of their healthy full-term infants., RESULTS: No significant differences could be found among TGHR and adiponectin levels in colostrum, cord blood and maternal serum. The median FGHR level in colostrum was significantly higher than that of maternal serum and cord blood. The colostrum TGHR was negatively correlated with body mass index (BMI) and weight of the infants at birth. TGHR and FGHR levels in colostrum were found to be positively correlated with those of maternal TGHR and FGHR concentrations, respectively. Adiponectin levels in colostrum were not correlated with BMI or birthweight of the infants or BMI of the mothers., CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the source of ghrelin in breast milk is probably both breast tissue itself and the serum of the mother. Ghrelin in colostrum seems to be related to the anthropometry of infants even at birth, unlike adiponectin. Copyright © 2010 Japan Pediatric Society.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It has been shown that leptin is present in breast milk and human mammary epithelial cells are able to synthesize leptin. It has been suggested that leptin in human milk might be involved in the regulation of postnatal nutrition and growth., AIMS: To investigate whether there is a relationship between leptin levels in human milk and weight gain in the postnatal period and to compare variations of milk-borne maternal leptin concentrations for small for gestational age (SGA), large for gestational age (LGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants., INFANTS AND METHODS: Forty-seven healthy lactating women aged from 17-38 years and their infants were included in the study. The infants were separated into three groups according to birth weight as SGA (n = 11), LGA (n = 14) and AGA (n = 22). All infants were fed with breast milk during the study period. Anthropometric measurements were performed on the 15th day of life and at 1, 2, and 3 months of age, and the body mass index (BMI) of the infants' mothers was calculated. Breast milk leptin levels were analyzed by radioimmunoassay., RESULTS: Breast milk leptin levels were found reduced in the SGA group and increased in the LGA group compared to the AGA group at 15 days of life (13.4 +/- 2.2, 28.5 +/- 4.4 and 18.4 +/- 2 ng/ml, respectively; p <0.05). At 1 month of age, leptin levels in breast milk were significantly lower in the LGA group than in the AGA group (15.5 +/- 4.9, 19.4 +/- 1.7 ng/ml, respectively; p<0.05). There was no difference among the three groups at 2 and 3 months of age (p>0.05). There was a positive correlation between birth Weight and breast milk leptin levels on the 15th day (r = 0.47, p = 0.001). A negative correlation was found between weight gain during the first 15 days and 1 month of life and breast milk leptin levels on the 15th day (r = -0.44, p = 0.002; r = -0.40, p = 0.005, respectively). No relationship could be determined between breast milk leptin levels and BMI of the mothers., CONCLUSION: Maternal milk of SGA, LGA and AGA infants had different leptin levels, especially during the first month of life. More rapid growth was shown in the SGA infants during the first postnatal 15 days compared to AGA and LGA infants, and human milk leptin levels were significantly reduced in the SGA group. However, LGA infants gained more weight during the second 15 days of life and breast milk leptin levels were dramatically decreased in LGA and increased in SGA infants at the end of first month of life. These findings suggest that the presence of leptin in breast milk might have a significant role in growth, appetite and regulation of nutrition in infancy, especially during the early lactation period, and the production of leptin in breast tissue by human mammary epithelial cells might be regulated physiologically according to necessity and state of the infant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm, very-low-birth-weight (PT-VLBW) neonates are at-risk for metabolic syndrome later in life. At 1-3 y, they exhibit excessive weight-for-length z-scores (Wt-LZ) and elevated systolic blood pressures (SBP). Serum adipokines are biomarkers of adiposity, but expression in PT-VLBW infants is unclear. We examined the correlation between serum adipokine levels, anthropometric measures and SBP in PT-VLBW neonates at follow-up., METHODS: This was a cross-sectional cohort study of PT-VLBW infants at 1, 2, and 3 y of age (40/cohort). We measured SBP, abdominal circumference (AC) and anthropometrics; calculated age/gender-specific z-scores for Wt, L, Wt-L and subscapular skin fold (SSZ), and measured serum adipokines., RESULTS: Serum leptin was unaffected by chronologic age and gender, but was positively correlated with weight, Wt-LZ, AC, and SSZ at 1 and 3 y (P < 0.01). Female infants at 1 and 3 y had a more significant relationship than males between serum leptin and SSZ (P < 0.001, R = 0.75 and P < 0.001, R = 0.70, respectively). Adiponectin levels were 16-20% lower at 3 vs. 1-2 y (P = 0.02, ANOVA) and negatively correlated with SBP., CONCLUSION: Although serum leptin was unrelated to advancing age, gender, and SBP in PT-VLBW infants, levels correlated with measures of adiposity at 1 and 3 y, females > males, suggesting leptin resistance may occur in early infancy.

AB  - Placental regulation of fetal growth involves the integration of multiple signaling pathways that modulate an array of placental functions, including nutrient transport. As a result, the flux of oxygen and nutrients to the fetus is altered, leading to changes in placental and fetal growth. Placental insulin/insulinlike growth factor-1 and mechanistic target of rapamycin signaling and amino acid transport capacity are inhibited in fetal growth restriction and activated in fetal overgrowth, implicating these placental functions in driving fetal growth. With novel approaches to specifically target the placenta, clinical interventions to modulate placental function in high-risk pregnancies can be developed. Copyright © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Catch-up growth early in life (after fetal, neonatal or infantile growth retardation) is a major risk factor for later obesity, type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases. These risks are generally interpreted alongside teleological arguments that environmental exposures which hinder growth early in life lead to programming of 'thrifty mechanisms' that are adaptive during the period of limited nutrient supply (or growth constraint), but which increase risks for diseases during improved nutrition and catch-up growth later in life. This paper addresses this notion of 'thrifty mechanisms' in the light of evidence that catch-up growth is characterized by a disproportionately higher rate of fat gain relative to lean tissue gain, and that such preferential catch-up fat is in part driven by energy conservation mechanisms operating via suppressed thermogenesis. It provides a molecular-physiological framework which integrates emerging insights into mechanisms by which this thrifty 'catch-up fat' phenotype cross-links with insulin and leptin resistance.

AB  - Being born small is associated with an increased risk of visceral obesity and insulin resistance in adult life. We have investigated the effect of IUGR on adipogenic and lipogenic gene expression in visceral fat in the lamb at 3 wk of age. Perirenal fat mass, but not adipocyte size was greater in females than males, independent of birth weight. Plasma insulin concentrations during the first 24 It after birth predicted the size of the adipocytes and expression of adiponectin in visceral adipose tissue in both males and females. In females, plasma nonesterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations during the first 24 h after birth were directly related to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) mRNA expression in the perirenal fat depot at 3 wk of age. In the males, in contrast to the females, PPAR gamma and leptin expression in perirenal visceral fat were significantly lower in IUGR compared with control lambs. Thus, the early nutritional environment programs adipocyte growth and gene expression in visceral adipose tissue. The differential effect of sex and IUGR on PPAR gamma and leptin expression in visceral fat may be important in the subsequent development of visceral obesity and the insulin resistant phenotype in later life.

AB  - Placental restriction of fetal growth decreases IGF1 and leptin mRNA expression in the perirenal adipose tissue of late gestation fetal sheep. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 294: R1413-R1419, 2008. First published February 13, 2008; doi: 10.1152/ ajpregu. 00787.2007.-Placental restriction ( PR) of fetal growth results in a low birth weight and an increased visceral fat mass in postnatal life. We investigated whether PR alters expression of genes that regulate adipogenesis [ IGF1, IGF1 receptor ( IGF1R), IGF2, IGF2R, proliferator-activated receptor-gamma, retinoid-X-receptor-alpha], adipocyte metabolism ( lipoprotein lipase, G3PDH, GAPDH) and adipokine signaling ( leptin, adiponectin) in visceral adipose tissue before birth. PR was induced by removal of the majority of endometrial caruncles in nonpregnant ewes before mating. Fetal blood samples were collected from 116 days gestation, and perirenal visceral adipose tissue ( PAT) was collected from PR and control fetuses at 145 days. PAT gene expression was measured by quantitative RT-PCR. PR fetuses had a lower weight ( PR 2.90 +/- 0.32 kg; control, 5.12 +/- 0.24 kg; P < 0.0001), mean gestational arterial P-O2 ( P < 0.0001), plasma glucose ( P < 0.01), and insulin concentrations ( P < 0.02), than controls. The expression of IGF1 mRNA in PAT was lower in the PR fetuses ( PR, 0.332 +/- 0.063; control, 0.741 +/- 0.083; P < 0.01). Leptin mRNA expression in PAT was also lower in PR fetuses ( PR, 0.077 +/- 0.009; control, 0.115 +/- 0.013; P < 0.05), although there was no difference in the expression of other adipokine or adipogenic genes in PAT between PR and control fetuses. Thus, restriction of placental and hence, fetal substrate supply results in decreased IGF1 and leptin expression in fetal visceral adipose tissue, which may alter the functional development of the perirenal fat depot and contribute to altered leptin signaling in the growth-restricted newborn and the subsequent emergence of an increased visceral adiposity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Large for gestational age infants have an increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular and metabolic complications during life. Knowledge of the key predictive factors of neonatal adiposity is required to devise targeted antenatal interventions. Our objective was to determine the fetal metabolic factors that influence regional neonatal adiposity in a cohort of women with previous large for gestational age offspring., METHODS: Data from the ROLO [Randomised COntrol Trial of LOw Glycaemic Index in Pregnancy] study were analysed in the ROLO Kids study. Neonatal anthropometric and skinfold measurements were compared with fetal leptin and C-peptide results from cord blood in 185 cases. Analyses were performed to examine the association between these metabolic factors and birthweight, anthropometry and markers of central and generalised adiposity., RESULTS: Fetal leptin was found to correlate with birthweight, general adiposity and multiple anthropometric measurements. On multiple regression analysis, fetal leptin remained significantly associated with adiposity, independent of gender, maternal BMI, gestational age or study group assignment, while fetal C-peptide was no longer significant., CONCLUSION: Fetal leptin may be an important predictor of regional neonatal adiposity. Interventional studies are required to assess the impact of neonatal adiposity on the subsequent risk of childhood obesity and to determine whether interventions which reduce circulating leptin levels have a role to play in improving neonatal adiposity measures.

AB  - Context: Impaired maternal lipid metabolism in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) has detrimental effects on maternal health and fetal growth. We previously reported the excessive expression of adrenomedullin (ADM) and its receptors in GDM adipose tissues compared with normal glucose-tolerant pregnancies. In the present study, we determined the mechanisms underlying enhanced expression of ADM and its receptors. Design: Omental adipose tissue (OAT) samples were collected from women during cesarian section of term pregnancy with nonoverweight (NOW; n = 9), overweight (OW; n = 8), obese (OBS; n = 10), and GDM (n = 10) status. Results: The expression of ADM and its receptors was greater in OATs from GDM than from women who were NOW, OW, and OBS. The expression of adipokines, leptin, and resistin were significantly increased, but adiponectin was decreased in OATs from patients with GDM compared with those without GDM. Macrophage infiltration and TNF-alpha expression were greater in OAT from pregnant women with GDM than in pregnant women without GDM. Furthermore, TNF-alpha dose dependently increased mRNA for ADM and its receptor components calcitonin receptor-like receptor and receptor activity-modifying proteins 2 and 3 in OAT explants from women who were NOW. Human adipocytes treated with ADM significantly increased glycerol release in culture medium, and the increases of glycerol in culture medium of OAT from women with GDM were attenuated by ADM antagonists, ADM22-52. Conclusions: Increased macrophage infiltration and TNF-alpha expression in adipose tissue from GDM, but not from OBS, tissues stimulate ADM and its receptor overexpression, leading to enhanced lipolysis and hyperlipidemia. This might contribute to fetal macrosomia and adiposity in diabetic pregnancies.

AB  - Context: Fetal overgrowth is associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes in adulthood. It is unclear whether there are alterations in insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in early life., Objective: To determine whether large-for-gestational-age (LGA) (birth weight > 90th percentile), an indicator of fetal overgrowth, is associated with altered fetal insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function., Study Design, Population, and Outcomes: In the Design, Development, and Discover birth cohort in Canada, we studied 106 pairs of LGA and optimal-for-gestational-age (OGA; birth weight, 25th to 75th percentiles) infants matched by maternal ethnicity, smoking status, and gestational age. Cord plasma glucose-to-insulin ratio was used as an indicator of fetal insulin sensitivity, and proinsulin-to-insulin ratio was used as an indicator of beta-cell function. Cord plasma leptin and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin concentrations were measured., Results: Comparisons of infants who were born LGA vs OGA, adjusted for maternal and newborn characteristics, showed that cord blood insulin, proinsulin, and leptin concentrations were significantly higher, whereas HWM adiponectin concentrations were similar. Glucose-to-insulin ratios were significantly lower (15.4 +/- 28.1 vs 22.0 +/- 24.9; P = 0.004), and proinsulin-to-insulin ratios significantly higher (0.73 +/- 0.82 vs 0.60 +/- 0.78; P = 0.005) in LGA vs OGA newborns, indicating lower insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function in LGA newborns. These significant differences were almost unchanged after further adjustment for cord blood adiponectin levels but disappeared upon additional adjustment for cord blood leptin levels., Conclusions: This study demonstrates that LGA may be associated with decreases in both fetal insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function. The alterations appear to be linked to elevated leptin levels.

AB  - Background: Laminopathies, due to mutations in LMNA, encoding A type-lamins, can lead to premature ageing and/or lipodystrophic syndromes, showing that these diseases could have close physiopathological relationships. We show here that lipodystrophy and extreme insulin resistance can also reveal the adult progeria Werner syndrome linked to mutations in WRN, encoding a RecQ DNA helicase. Methods: We analysed the clinical and biological features of two women, aged 32 and 36, referred for partial lipodystrophic syndrome which led to the molecular diagnosis of Werner syndrome. Cultured skin fibroblasts from one patient were studied. Results: Two normal-weighted women presented with a partial lipodystrophic syndrome with hypertriglyceridemia and liver steatosis. One of them had also diabetes. Both patients showed a peculiar, striking lipodystrophic phenotype with subcutaneous lipoatrophy of the four limbs contrasting with truncal and abdominal fat accumulation. Their oral glucose tolerance tests showed extremely high levels of insulinemia, revealing major insulin resistance. Low serum levels of sex-hormone binding globulin and adiponectin suggested a post-receptor insulin signalling defect. Other clinical features included bilateral cataracts, greying hair and distal skin atrophy. We observed biallelic WRN null mutations in both women (p.Q748X homozygous, and compound heterozygous p. Q1257X/p.M1329fs). Their fertility was decreased, with preserved menstrual cycles and normal follicle-stimulating hormone levels ruling out premature ovarian failure. However undetectable anti-mullerian hormone and inhibin B indicated diminished follicular ovarian reserve. Insulin-resistance linked ovarian hyperandrogenism could also contribute to decreased fertility, and the two patients became pregnant after initiation of insulin-sensitizers (metformin). Both pregnancies were complicated by severe cervical incompetence, leading to the preterm birth of a healthy newborn in one case, but to a second trimester-abortion in the other. WRN-mutated fibroblasts showed oxidative stress, increased lamin B1 expression, nuclear dysmorphies and premature senescence. Conclusions: We show here for the first time that partial lipodystrophy with severe insulin resistance can reveal WRN-linked premature aging syndrome. Increased expression of lamin B1 with altered lamina architecture observed in WRN-mutated fibroblasts could contribute to premature cellular senescence. Primary alterations in DNA replication and/or repair should be considered as possible causes of lipodystrophic syndromes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In addition to obesity, low birth weight (LBW) has been proposed as another independent risk factor associated with cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus., OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the influence of birth weight on abdominal fat distribution, adipocytokine levels and associated metabolic alterations in obese children., METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in 92 children. Children were divided into three groups according to their body mass index and birth weight. Glucose and insulin (0 and 120 min), lipid profile and adipocytokines were measured. Abdominal fat distribution was assessed by magnetic resonance imaging., RESULTS: Obese LBW children had higher fasting glucose (P = 0.054) and insulin (P < 0.001), and 120 min glucose (P < 0.001) and insulin levels (P < 0.001), such as increased HOMA-IR (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance index) (P < 0.001). Obesity and LBW were associated with lower concentrations of high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin (-2.38 [IC 95% -4.27; -0.42, P = 0.018]) and higher subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) (28.05 [IC 95% 0.40; 55.7, P = 0.047]) compared with NBW obese children, independent of age or sex., CONCLUSIONS: LBW in obese children is associated with lower HMW adiponectin, increased insulin resistance and greater SAT.

AB  - Leptin is a 16-kDa polypeptide, encoded in humans by the LEP gene. This protein is probably involved in the regulation of ovarian function, oocyte maturation and embryo development, and in the implantation process. During pregnancy, leptin is produced in the placenta; its values increase in the maternal blood particularly in the second trimester and decline postpartum. Leptin levels may be abnormally high in pregnancies complicated by conditions such as diabetes mellitus and pre-eclampsia. The role of leptin in fetal physiology has not been clarified, although cord blood values correlate significantly with birth weight. It is expected that further research will provide new insight into the physiological importance of leptin in the pregnant woman and fetus.

AB  - Context: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with a disturbance of carbohydrate and lipid metabolism., Objective: To determine whether T1DM alters maternal and neonatal fatty acid (FA) levels., Design: Observational study., Setting: Academic hospital., Patients: Sixty pregnant women (30 women with T1DM with good glycemic control and 30 healthy women) were included in the study. Maternal blood, umbilical vein, and artery blood samples were collected immediately upon delivery. Following lipid extraction, the FA profiles of the total FA pool of maternal serum and umbilical vein and artery serum were determined by gas chromatography., Results: Total FA concentration in maternal serum did not differ between the study groups; it was significantly higher in umbilical vein serum of the T1DM group compared with that in the control group [median (interquartile range)]: T1DM 2126.2 (1446.4 to 3181.3) and control 1073.8 (657.5 to 2226.0; P < 0.001), and in umbilical artery vein serum: T1DM 1805.7 (1393.1 to 2125.0) and control 990.0 (643.3 to 1668.0; P < 0.001). Composition of FAs in umbilical vein serum showed significantly higher concentrations of saturated, monounsaturated, and polyunsaturated FAs (SFAs, MUFAs, and PUFAs, respectively) in the T1DM group than compared with those in the control group (P = 0.001). Furthermore, cord blood levels of leptin (P < 0.001), C-peptide (P < 0.001), and insulin resistance (P = 0.015) were higher in the T1DM group compared with controls., Conclusion: The neonates born to mothers with T1DM had higher concentrations of total FAs, SFAs and MUFAs, as well as PUFAs, compared with control newborns.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Maternal obesity increases the risk of poor pregnancy outcome including stillbirth, pre-eclampsia, fetal growth restriction and fetal overgrowth. These pregnancy complications are associated with dysfunctional syncytiotrophoblast, the transporting epithelium of the human placenta. Taurine, a beta-amino acid with antioxidant and cytoprotective properties, has a role in syncytiotrophoblast development and function and is required for fetal growth and organ development. Taurine is conditionally essential in pregnancy and fetal tissues depend on uptake of taurine from maternal blood. We tested the hypothesis that taurine uptake into placental syncytiotrophoblast by the taurine transporter protein (TauT) is lower in obese women (body mass index (BMI)30 kg m(-)(2)) than in women of ideal weight (BMI 18.5-24.9 kg m(-)(2)) and explored potential regulatory factors., SUBJECTS/METHODS: Placentas were collected from term (37-42-week gestation), uncomplicated, singleton pregnancies from women with BMI 19-49 kg m(-)(2). TauT activity was measured as the Na(+)-dependent uptake of (3)H-taurine into placental villous fragments. TauT expression in membrane-enriched placental samples was investigated by western blot. In vitro studies using placental villous explants examined whether leptin or IL-6, adipokines/cytokines that are elevated in maternal obesity, regulates TauT activity., RESULTS: Placental TauT activity was significantly lower in obese women (BMI30) than women of ideal weight (P<0.03) and inversely related to maternal BMI (19-49 kg m(-)(2); P<0.05; n=61). There was no difference in TauT expression between placentas of ideal weight and obese class III (BMI40) subjects. Long-term exposure (48 h) of placental villous explants to leptin or IL-6 did not affect TauT activity., CONCLUSIONS: Placental TauT activity at term is negatively related to maternal BMI. We propose that the reduction in placental TauT activity in maternal obesity could lower syncytiotrophoblast taurine concentration, compromise placental development and function, and reduce the driving force for taurine efflux to the fetus, thereby increasing the risk of poor pregnancy outcome.

AB  - Arachidonic acid (AA) is considered essential in fetal development and some of its metabolites are thought to be important mediators of the immune responses. Therefore, we studied whether prenatal exposure to AA is associated with some immune-related clinical conditions and plasma markers in childhood. In 280 children aged 7 years, atopy, lung function and plasma inflammation markers were measured and their relationships with early AA exposure were studied by linear and logistic regression analyses. AA exposure was deduced from AA concentrations in plasma phospholipids of the mothers collected at several time points during pregnancy and at delivery, and in umbilical cord plasma and arterial and venous wall phospholipids. In unadjusted regression analyses, significant positive associations were observed between maternal AA concentrations at 16 and 32 weeks of pregnancy (proxies for fetal AA exposure) and peak expiratory flow decline after maximal physical exercise and plasma fibrinogen concentrations of their children, respectively. However, after correction for relevant covariables, only trends remained. A significant negative relationship was observed between AA concentrations in cord plasma (reflecting prenatal AA exposure) and the average daily amplitude of peak expiratory flow at rest, which lost significance after appropriate adjustment. Because of these few, weak and inconsistent relationships, a major impact of early-life exposure to AA on atopy, lung function and selected plasma inflammation markers of children at 7 years of age seems unlikely.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study blood Leptin level of 154 (78 male, 76 female) Chinese obese/non-obese children aged 0 - 14 years during 1999 - 2001., METHODS: The gender- and age-specific distribution pattern of Leptin and its relationship with anthropometric parameters (waist circumference, waist/hip ratio, lean body mass, fat mass, body fat percentage, BMI/Kaup index etc.) and blood insulin level were recorded., RESULTS: (1) The blood Leptin level in healthy non-obese kids ranged from 1.01 - 29.92 (ng/ml), the mean values and SD were 2.99 +/- 2.13 (ng/ml) [90% confidence interval was 1.36 - 14.21 (ng/ml) in boys and 1.74 - 21.17 (ng/ml) in girls]. There was no significant difference in the blood Leptin level between serum and plasma. (2) The blood Leptin level was higher in overweight/obese kids than that in non-obese kids (P < 0.001). (3) There was significant difference in the blood Leptin levels between boys and girls groups (P = 0.023), especially in non-obese group (P = 0.004). The multiple regression analysis showed that there was no correlation between gender and blood Leptin level when body fat factor was added (P = 0.138, 0.241, 0.990), but there was still a strong correlation between blood leptin level and BMI, FM and BF% (P < 0.001). (4) There was a correlation between blood Leptin level and age (P = 0.005), especially in overweight/obese group and in girls (P = 0.001). The blood Leptin level rose from early puberty, especially in girl group (P = 0.045). There was significant difference in blood Leptin level in different age groups (P < 0.001) (5) There were strong positive correlation between blood Leptin level and BMI, BM and FM%, a weak correlation with LBM, and no correlation with W/H ratio in boys and a positive relationship in girls. The Quatatic equation was better than the linear equation in description of the correlation mentioned above. (6) There was a correlation between blood Leptin from 0 to 7 yr and birth weight (P = 0.001), after 7 yr of age this correlation disappeared (P = 0.456). (7) A positive correlation was seen between blood Leptin level and blood insulin level (P < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The blood Leptin level of 0 - 14 years old children is consistent with the level of growth of adiposity tissue and the degree of adiposity rebound.

AB  - Purpose: Exosomes play a key role in cell-to-cell communication by transferring their cargo to target tissues. Little is known on the course of exosome size and number in infants and children., Methods: Longitudinally, we assessed the size and number of circulating exosomes at birth and at ages 2 and 7 yr in 75 infants/children born appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA; n=40) or small-for-gestational-age (SGA; n=35 with spontaneous catch-up), and related those results to concomitantly assessed measures of endocrine-metabolic health (HOMA-IR; IGF-1), body composition (by DXA at ages 0 and 2) and abdominal fat partitioning (subcutaneous, visceral and hepatic fat by MRI at age 7)., Results: Circulating exosomes of AGAs decreased in size (on average by 4.2%) and increased in number (on average by 77%) between birth and age 7. Circulating exosomes of SGAs (as compared to those of AGAs) had a larger size at birth [146.8 vs 137.8 nm, respectively; p=0.02], and were in lower number at ages 2 [4.3x1011 vs 5.6x1011 particles/mL, respectively; p=0.01] and 7 [6.3x1011 vs 6.8x1011 particles/mL, respectively; p=0.006]. Longitudinal changes were thus more pronounced in SGAs for exosome size, and in AGAs for exosome number. At age 7, exosome size associated (P<0.0001) to liver fat in the whole study population., Conclusion: Early-life changes in circulating exosomes include a minor decrease in size and a major increase in number, and these changes may be influenced by fetal growth. Exosome size may become one of the first circulating markers of liver fat in childhood. Copyright © 2023 Diaz, Casano, Quesada, Lopez-Bermejo, de Zegher, Villarroya and Ibanez.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Progranulin (PGRN) displays pleiotropic biological functions and has been proposed as a biomarker for metabolic diseases. We longitudinally assessed PGRN concentrations in infants born appropriate (AGA) or small for gestational age (SGA), the latter being at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes, especially if they experience an excessive postnatal catch-up in weight and are formula-fed (FF)., METHODS: The study population consisted of 183 infants who were exclusively breast-fed [(BF), AGA, n = 66; SGA, n = 40], or FF (AGA, n = 31; SGA, n = 46) over the first 4 months. Assessments included auxology, fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-1, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, PGRN and body composition (by DXA), at birth, and at age 4 and 12 months., RESULTS: PGRN levels were low at birth and unaffected by prenatal growth. PGRN increased at 4 and 12 months, although to a lesser extent in SGA infants, and was unrelated to the mode of feeding. PGRN correlated with markers of adiposity, inflammation and insulin resistance in both AGA and SGA infants, especially in those FF., CONCLUSIONS: The attenuated increase of PGRN levels in SGA infants over the first year of life, along with the association to markers of unhealthy metabolic profile, might point to a role of PGRN in future disease risks., IMPACT: Progranulin (PGRN) displays pleiotropic biological functions and has been proposed as a biomarker for metabolic diseases. In healthy infants, PGRN concentrations are low at birth and experience a significant and progressive increase up to age 12 months, which is less marked in infants born small for gestational age (SGA) and is unrelated to the mode of feeding. Circulating PGRN is related to markers of adiposity, inflammation, and insulin sensitivity, especially in formula-fed SGA infants. PGRN may play a role in the metabolic adaptations of SGA infants during early life, potentially contributing to the risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes in this population. Copyright © 2023.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diazepam-binding inhibitor (DBI) controls feeding behaviour and glucose homeostasis. Individuals born small-for-gestational-age (SGA) with excessive postnatal catch-up in weight are at risk for obesity and type 2 diabetes., OBJECTIVE: To assess serum concentrations of DBI (0-2 years) in appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA, n = 70) vs SGA infants (n = 33) with spontaneous catch-up and their relationship with endocrine-metabolic and adiposity markers., METHODS: Longitudinal assessments included auxology, fasting glucose, insulin, insulin-like growth factor, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, DBI and body composition (absorptiometry). DBI was measured cross-sectionally in pregnant and non-pregnant women and in 2-day-old newborns. DBI mRNA expression levels were assessed in adult and neonatal tissues., RESULTS: Cord blood DBI concentrations were similar in AGA and SGA newborns and about fivefold higher than those in women. Serum DBI levels decreased by age 2 days, were higher in SGA vs AGA infants at age 2 years and associated negatively with markers of adiposity and insulin resistance and positively with high-molecular-weight adiponectin. DBI mRNA expression was lower in placenta than in other tissues., CONCLUSION: The increased DBI concentrations at birth are unrelated to prenatal growth. The higher DBI levels in SGA subjects at age 2 years may be related to catch-up growth or represent an adaptive mechanism to promote lipogenesis. Copyright © 2021 World Obesity Federation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Growth-and-differentiation-factor-15 (GDF15) is a regulator of energy homeostasis. To determine the relationship between circulating GDF15 and parameters of metabolic health, we assessed longitudinally GDF15 concentrations in infants born either appropriate- (AGA) or small-for-gestational-age (SGA), the latter population known to be at risk for metabolic alterations, particularly after a rapid postnatal catch-up in weight., METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 103 infants (70 AGA and 33 SGA). Assessments included body length, weight, and ponderal index (PI); fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-I, high-molecular-weight adiponectin, GDF15; and body composition (by absorptiometry) at birth, and at age 4, 12 and 24 months., RESULTS: GDF15 levels at birth were significantly higher than those at each subsequent time point and were similar in AGA and SGA subjects. GDF15 concentrations dropped at age 4 months, more substantially in SGA infants, and continued to decline in both subgroups reaching adult concentrations by age 24 months. GDF15 levels correlated inversely with the changes in PI, IGF-I and body fat throughout follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: Early life is associated with supra-adult concentrations of GDF15. The lower levels of GDF15 in SGA subjects may be an adaptive mechanism to promote catch-up in weight and might increase the risk for obesity later in life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Children born small-for-gestational-age (SGA) who experience rapid postnatal catch-up in weight are at risk for central adiposity and hyperinsulinemia., OBJECTIVES: To study the effects of prepubertal metformin intervention over 24 months on the body composition and endocrine-metabolic profile of catch-up SGA children., METHODS: Double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot study including 23 post-catch-up non-obese prepubertal SGA children [age, 7.7 yr; body mass index standard deviation score (BMI SDS) >50th and <97th centile for age] with increased visceral fat [by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) both p > 75th for age]. Patients were randomized to receive either placebo or metformin (425 mg/d) for 24 months. Clinical, biochemical [IGF-I, glucose, insulin, lipids, androgens, sex-hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) and high-molecular-weight (HMW)-adiponectin] and imaging [body composition (absorptiometry and MRI; carotid intima-media thickness (ultrasonography)] variables were assessed at baseline, and at 6, 12, and 24 months., RESULTS: After 24 months, metformin-treated children were leaner, had higher SHBG levels, and less total and abdominal fat than placebo-treated children (all p <= 0.05). Longitudinal analyses showed that metformin had a significant effect on anthropometric (weight, BMI, and waist) and biochemical variables [glucose, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and triglycerides] (all p <= 0.05); and in total and abdominal fat (p = 0.01 and p = 0.02)., CONCLUSIONS: Prepubertal intervention with metformin reduces central adiposity and improves insulin sensitivity in non-obese catch-up SGA children.

AB  - Prenatal growth restraint associates with the risk for later diabetes, particularly if such restraint is followed by postnatal formula-feeding (FOF) rather than breast-feeding (BRF). Circulating incretins can influence the neonatal programming of hypothalamic setpoints for appetite and energy expenditure, and are thus candidate mediators of the long-term effects exerted by early nutrition. We have tested this concept by measuring (at birth and at age 4 months) the circulating concentrations of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in BRF infants born appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA; n=63) and in small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants receiving either BRF (n=28) or FOF (n=26). At birth, concentrations of GLP-1 were similar in AGA and SGA infants. At 4 months, pre-feeding GLP-1 concentrations were higher than at birth; SGA-BRF infants had GLP-1 concentrations similar to those in AGA-BRF infants but SGA-FOF infants had higher concentrations. In conclusion, nutrition appears to influence the circulating GLP-1 concentrations in SGA infants and may thereby modulate long-term diabetes risk.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to determine whether newborn birth weights were associated with insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), zinc, and leptin in preeclamptic and normotensive pregnancies., METHODS: This study was done cross-sectionally and included 15 women with moderate preeclampsia (PE group) and 11 normotensive pregnant women (NT group) of similar gestational age. Maternal and umbilical cord serum levels of zinc, IGF-I, IGF binding proteins (IGFBPs), leptin, and placental zinc were assessed in each group., RESULTS: As compared with the NT group, the PE group had significantly (p <0.05) lower newborn birth weight [3.33 (3.11-3.55) vs. 2.80 (2.40-3.17) kg], maternal IGF-I [303 (276-364) vs. 198 (153-244) ng/mL], and umbilical IGF-I [87 (71-126) vs. 44 (26-98) ng/mL]. In addition, low IGFBP-3 and high IGFBP-1 were observed in the PE group. In the PE group, birth weight correlated positively with placental zinc (rho = 0.56, p = 0.04), maternal IGF-I (rho = 0.76, p = 0.004), umbilical cord IGF-I (rho = 0.75, p = 0.005), and umbilical cord leptin (rho = 0.61, p = 0.02) levels. Stepwise multiple regression analysis showed that among these variables, umbilical IGF-I was the major predictor of birth weight. In the NT group, birth weight did not correlate with any of these variables., CONCLUSIONS: The present study indicates that moderate preeclampsia is associated with low newborn birth weight, IGF-I, IGFBP-3, and high IGFBP-1 without significant changes in zinc and leptin levels. In addition, umbilical IGF-I was the major predictor of newborn birth weight.

AB  - AIM: Rapid growth in infancy may be associated with later onset childhood obesity. The aim in this study was to evaluate the relationships of adipokines to growth of infants at 6-10 months of age and to serum insulin, glucose, and auxological parameters of infants and their mothers., METHODS: Thirty-seven healthy term AGA formula fed infants, 21 males, mean age 7.0 +/- 1.2 (SD) months, were evaluated during a nutritional assessment at a county health department. Length, weight, head circumference, waist circumference, mid-arm circumference, and subscapular skin fold and triceps skin fold thickness were determined. Mothers were weighed and their height measured, birth weight recorded from clinic records, and the infant's dietary history reviewed. Following finger stick for assessment of hemoglobin, a bedside blood glucose was determined and 250 microl of additional serum taken for assay of total adiponectin, high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin (n=12), leptin, and insulin., RESULTS: The infants' total adiponectin to leptin ratio correlated significantly with the change in body weight from birth to mid-infancy (r = 0.349, p < 0.05). The mean total adiponectin was 34.2 - 16.6 microg/ml (n=37), mean HMW adiponectin 12.2 +/- 9.0 microg/ml (n=12), mean HMW/total adiponectin ratio 34.3 +/- 17.6%, and mean leptin 1.3 +/- 1.2 ng/ml. Neither total nor HMW adiponectin, leptin, nor the leptin/adiponectin ratio, correlated with serum insulin, glucose/insulin ratio, hemoglobin, birth weight, or auxological determinations of the infants or mothers., CONCLUSIONS: As leptin and adiponectin are both insulin sensitizing hormones that change inversely with acquisition of body fat, and the leptin/adiponectin ratio correlates significantly with weight gain in mid-infancy, we postulate that this ratio might provide a marker relating to infantile growth and later adiposity.

AB  - Various biological factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of postpartum depression (PPD), although exact mechanism is still unclear. Adipokines leptin and adiponectin have been independently associated with depression in general population. We measured the concentration of leptin and adiponectin in women with and without postpartum depression, and observe their association with parameters of neonatal physiological health (APGAR score, and birth weight). Women were screened for the presence of depression using Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) on their visit at 6 weeks postpartum. Serum was used to analyze lipid profile (spectrophotometric method), and leptin and adiponectin(commercially available ELISA kits). 90 women with PPD and 90 age-matched controls were included in the final analysis. Leptin and adiponectin concentration did not differ statistically between two groups, although a higher level of leptin was observed in depressed women. Leptin levels were positively correlated with infant birth weight, whereas APGAR score at 1 min was positively correlated with adiponectin levels, and negatively correlated with leptin/adiponectin ratio at 5 min in women without depression. This relationship was lost in women with postpartum depression. These findings suggest an alteration in the dynamics of adipokine secretion in postpartum depression, which may have both fetal and maternal effects.

AB  - Abdominal obesity may be defined as excess deposits of fat in the abdominal region. It is a common health condition seen in South Asians and is positively related to non-communicable diseases (NCDs). It is independent of body mass index and measured by raised waist circumference for men >= 90 cm and women >= 80 cm. The reason for its prevalence being common in Indians finds its root from pregnancy, during fetal period and has emerged as a concept of 'Thin Fat Indian'. Malnutrition in such a critical period of growth has consequences in the form of reduced basal metabolic rate (BMR), reduced blood flow to growing tissues, reduced functional ability of vital organs, endocrine changes and reduced capacity of primary adipose tissue. However, excess of visceral fat facilitates high dosage of adipokines in the portal vein to liver and other body tissues having serious implications seen in the form NCDs like diabetes, hypertension, heart diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, kidney disorders, cancer and other health problems. Abdominal obesity should be addressed before it has progressed further to defined health issues by exercise and diet, so that people can live a quality life.

AB  - Adipose tissue is no longer considered as inert; the literature describes the role it plays in the production of many substances, such as adiponectin, visfatin, ghrelin, S100B, apelin, TNF, IL-6 and leptin. These molecules have specific roles in humans and their potential as biomarkers useful for identifying alterations related to intrauterine growth retardation and large for gestational age neonates is emerging. Infants born in such conditions have undergone metabolic changes, such as fetal hypo- or hyperinsulinemia, which may lead to development of dysmetabolic syndrome and other chronic diseases in adulthood. In this review, these biomarkers are analyzed specifically and it is discussed how metabolomics may be an advantageous tool for detection, discrimination and prediction of metabolic alterations and diseases. Thus, a holistic approach, such as metabolomics, could help the prevention and early diagnosis of metabolic syndrome.

AB  - It is well known that adverse conditions during intrauterine life, such as intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), can result in permanent changes in the physiology and metabolism of the newborn, which in turn leads to an increased risk of disease in adulthood (fetal origin of adult disease hypothesis). In the first part of this review the epidemiological studies in which a correlation between low birth weight and chronic pathologies in adulthood was observed are reported. The second part of the review is focused on metabolomics studies that have revealed an altered metabolism in IUGR patients compared to controls. Together with more classic biomarkers of IUGR, such as endothelin-1, leptin, protein S100B and visfatin, the new holistic metabolomics approach has assumed a crescent role in the identification of disorders in the neonatal metabolic profile, determined by the interconnection of the different processes.

AB  - Although the use of folic acid supplements before and in the early stages of pregnancy is becoming increasingly well known, messages about the importance of obtaining a healthy body weight 'before' becoming pregnant do not appear to be as widely known and significantly add to financial stains placed upon health services. For women, being overweight or obese can reduce fertility, and increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and delivery complications in pregnancy. Equally, being underweight before becoming pregnancy can has its own health implications, including increased risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) deliveries. Consequently, body weights outside recommended reference ranges before pregnancy may contribute to a cycle of poor intergenerational health. Health interventions are needed to help women obtain a healthy bodyweight and educate them about the importance of eating a healthy diet 'before' becoming pregnant. © 2011 Bentham Science Publishers Ltd.

AB  - Women seem to be aware that they should reduce their alcohol and caffeine intakes in the run up to pregnancy and some may take folic acid supplements. However, the importance of attaining a 'healthy' body weight before becoming pregnant seems to be one key area that is overlooked. For women, being overweight or obese can reduce fertility, and increase the risk of certain medical conditions such as gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and delivery complications in pregnancy. Equally, being underweight before conception brings with it separate health implications, including fertility problems and increased risk of small-for-gestational age (SGA) deliveries. Consequently, body weights outside recommended reference ranges before pregnancy may contribute to a cycle of poor intergenerational health, as well as driving up health care costs. Health interventions are needed to increase women's understanding about why it is important to achieve a healthy body weight before becoming pregnant and how this can be safety achieved without impacting on nutrition status. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Epidemiological evidence has shown an association between prenatal malnutrition and a higher risk of developing metabolic disease in adult life. An inadequate intrauterine milieu affects both growth and development, leading to a permanent programming of endocrine and metabolic functions. Programming may be due to the epigenetic modification of genes implicated in the regulation of key metabolic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and microRNAs (miRNAs). The expression of miRNAs in organs that play a key role in metabolism is influenced by in utero programming, as demonstrated by both experimental and human studies. miRNAs modulate multiple pathways such as insulin signaling, immune responses, adipokine function, lipid metabolism, and food intake. Liver is one of the main target organs of programming, undergoing structural, functional, and epigenetic changes following the exposure to a suboptimal intrauterine environment. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of the effects of exposure to an adverse in utero milieu on epigenome with a focus on the molecular mechanisms involved in liver programming.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The study was performed to determine whether catch-up growth is associated with the development of insulin resistance and to explore serum endocrine markers associated with the metabolism of adipose tissue in a Chinese population born small for gestational age(SGA) SUBJECTS AND METHODS: We recruited 56 children born SGA with catch-up growth and 55 born without catch-up growth, who were further grouped into groups I (with BMI catch-up) and II (without BMI catch-up) respectively, as well as 52 children born appropriate for gestational age (AGA) with normal height. Their serum fasting insulin, fasting glucose, insulin-like growth factor-1, adiponectin, IGFBP-1, triglyceride concentrations, and the homeostasis assessment model for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) were evaluated., RESULTS: (1) The HOMA-IR values in SGA-I with catch-up growth group were significantly higher than those in SGA-II with catch-up growth, SGA-I without catch-up growth and AGA children respectively. (2) The serum adiponectin levels of individuals in the SGA-I without catch-up growth and SGA-II with catch-up growth groups were significantly lower than those from the SGA-II without catch-up growth group. There was no difference in triglyceride or IGFBP-1 levels among the groups. (3) The degree of HOMA-IR was positively correlated with age, current BMI and height SDS in SGA children., CONCLUSION: The development of insulin resistance and lower levels of adiponectin were closely correlated with higher BMI and the postnatal height catch-up growth in SGA children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the role of adiponectin and visfatin in the pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia (PE) and how their concentrations correlate with the severity of the disease and neonatal outcomes., STUDY DESIGN: A prospective case-control study was carried out in 52 preeclamptic and 28 healthy pregnant women during the third trimester. The maternal plasma concentrations of adiponectin and visfatin were determined. Neonatal outcomes were also recorded., RESULTS: Mean maternal plasma adiponectin concentrations in healthy pregnant women did not differ significantly from those of mild PE and severe PE groups. The plasma adiponectin levels of PE patients with small for gestational age (SGA) and those without SGA did not differ significantly, but the median plasma visfatin concentration of patients with SGA fetus was significantly higher if the patient was preeclamptic (p = 0.036)., CONCLUSION: The severity of preeclampsia did not change the plasma levels of adiponectin and visfatin, but the median plasma visfatin concentration of patients with SGA fetuses were significantly higher if the patient was preeclamptic. Altered levels of adipocytokines strongly imply that the regulation of adipocytokines in PE is different and more complex compared to that in healthy pregnancy.

AB  - The study aimed to determine the relationship between glucose, C-peptide, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and leptin between mother and fetus and neonatal weight., METHODS: In the prospective observational cohort study, we included 66 women with type-1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM). According to the z-score for neonatal weight, patients were divided into healthy-weight neonates (n = 42) and overweight neonates (n = 24). The maternal blood samples were taken during pregnancy and cesarean section when the umbilical vein blood sample was also withdrawn. The maternal vein sera were analyzed for fasting glucose, C-reactive protein (CRP), leptin, BDNF, TSH, FT3, and FT4. The umbilical vein sera were analyzed for glucose, C-peptide, leptin, TSH, thyroid-stimulating protein (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and BDNF concentration. The neonatologist measured the skinfold thickness on the third day of neonatal life., RESULTS: A strong correlation was confirmed between maternal and umbilical vein glucose concentration and maternal glucose and C-peptide in umbilical vein blood. A negative correlation was found between the concentration of BDNF in the umbilical vein and glucose in maternal blood. A strong correlation was seen between BMI and maternal blood leptin concentration, neonatal fat body mass, and umbilical vein blood leptin concentration. Higher BMI elevated BDNF, and TSH increase the odds for overweight neonates in the first trimester of pregnancy. Maternal higher leptin concentration in the first trimester decrease the odds of overweight neonates., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal glucose concentrations affect the fetus's glucose, C-peptide, and BDNF concentrations. Leptin levels increase in maternal blood due to increased body mass index, and in the neonate, fat body mass is responsible for increased leptin concentrations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood (CB) leptin is positively associated with adiposity at birth, but the association with child adiposity is unclear., OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that CB leptin is positively associated with adiposity in peripubertal children and with childhood leptin., METHODS: Leptin was measured in 986 CB and 931 childhood stored samples from a prospective birth cohort. Adiposity measures were collected at birth and mean age 11.5 years. Linear and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate associations between log-transformed CB leptin and neonatal and childhood adiposity measures as continuous and categorical variables, respectively., RESULTS: CB leptin was positively associated with neonatal and childhood adiposity. Childhood associations were attenuated when adjusted for maternal body mass index (BMI) and glucose, but remained statistically significant for childhood body fat percentage (beta = 1.15%, confidence interval [CI] = 0.46-1.84), body fat mass (beta = 0.69 kg, 95% CI = 0.16-1.23), sum of skin-folds (beta = 1.77 mm, 95% CI = 0.31-3.24), log-transformed child serum leptin (beta = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.06-0.20), overweight/obesity (OR = 1.21, 95% CI = 1.03-1.42), obesity (OR = 1.31, 95% CI = 1.04-1.66) and body fat percentage >85th percentile (OR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.12-1.73). Positive associations between newborn adiposity measures and CB leptin confirmed previous reports., CONCLUSION: CB leptin is positively associated with neonatal and childhood adiposity and child leptin levels, independent of maternal BMI and maternal hyperglycemia. CB leptin may be a biomarker of future adiposity risk. Copyright © 2023 The Authors. Pediatric Obesity published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd on behalf of World Obesity Federation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing physical activity in pregnancy may improve pregnancy outcomes for obese women. Exercise could reduce gestational weight gain, improve the maternal circulating lipid profile as well as alter leptin, Interleukin-8 (IL-8) and Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1) levels., AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of exercise on gestational weight gain, maternal circulating lipids, IL-8, MCP-1 and leptin levels in obese pregnant women., MATERIALS AND METHODS: The analysis was performed in the 35 obese women enrolled in the pilot BAMBINO randomised controlled trial who provided blood samples at 12- and 28-weeks gestation. Women in the exercise intervention arm received an individualised exercise plan. Blood samples, exercise diary and pedometer data were obtained at 12-, 20-, 28- and 36-weeks' gestation. Cord blood was obtained at delivery., RESULTS: Women in the exercise arm exercised more than those in the control arm (P = 0.038). There was no difference in gestational weight gain, excess gestational weight gain, MCP-1 and leptin levels between women in the exercise intervention (n = 19) or the control arm (n = 16). IL-8 was not detectable. Exercise did not alter the maternal lipid profile., CONCLUSIONS: The low level of physical activity achieved in obese women in the exercise intervention arm was insufficient to alter gestational weight gain, MCP-1, leptin or circulating lipid levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal lifestyle during pregnancy has an effect of gestational development and neonatal outcome. Overweight gravidas and gravidas with excessive weight gain have an increased risk of gestational complications and neonatal metabolic disorder. The underlying mechanisms are still under discussion, but the hormonally active fat mass and its biomarkers, adipocytokines, may play a key role by potentially having a direct impact on the metabolic homeostasis of the system in concert with other biomarkers like hepatokines and myokines. Up to now little is known in terms of lifestyle habits and their effect on this complex model on maternal and fetal outcome. Therefore, we aim to investigate the influence of maternal lifestyle clusters during pregnancy on the maternal and fetal biomarkers of compartments, specifically those implying maternal fat and muscle mass, maternal liver and the placenta and who are associated with maternal body composition and birth weight., METHODS: In this exploratory pilot study at least 100 singleton pregnancies and their newborns will be included. The women will undergo assessments of anthropometric measurements, venous blood samples will be drawn and physical activity and nutritional status will be collected through questionnaires. Newborns will undergo assessments of anthropometric measurements, umbilical cord samples will be drawn and birth outcomes will be evaluated. We will measure adipokines, myokines and hepatokines and relate them to maternal lifestyle clusters and fetal outcome., CONCLUSION: Our study will be the first to examine the relationship between maternal body composition, birth weight and potential biomarkers based on an innovative compartment model.

AB  - Although bariatric surgery is approved for a woman of child-bearing age with an interest in subsequent pregnancy, reports of in utero growth issues during pregnancy have garnered a closer look at the impact of maternal surgical weight loss on the pre- and postpartum periods. Offspring of dams having received vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) are born small-for-gestational age and have increased risk for metabolic syndrome later in life. Here, we aimed to determine whether the postnatal catch-up growth trajectory of bariatric offspring may be affected by milk composition. Milk samples were collected at postnatal day 15/16 from dams having received VSG surgery and fed a high-fat diet (HFD) (H-VSG), Sham surgery and fed chow (C-Sham), or Sham surgery and fed HFD (H-Sham). Milk obtained from H-VSG dams had elevated glucose (P < 0.05) and significantly reduced triglyceride content (P < 0.01). Milk from H-Sham dams had the lowest amount of milk protein (P < 0.05). Fatty acid composition measured by fractionation was largely not affected by surgery but rather maternal diet. No difference was observed in milk leptin levels; however, insulin, adiponectin, and growth hormone levels were significantly increased in milk from H-VSG animals. H-Sham had the lowest level of immunoglobulin (Ig)A, whereas IgG was significantly reduced in H-VSG. Taken together, the quality of milk from H-VSG dams suggests that milk composition could be a factor in reducing the rate of growth during the lactation period.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence suggests that developmental exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POP) and to some non persistent pesticides may disrupt metabolic regulation of glucose metabolism and insulin secretion, and thereby contribute to the current epidemic of obesity and metabolic disorders. Quasi-experimental situations of undernutrition in utero have provided some information. However, the evidence in humans concerning the role of the prenatal environment in these disorders is contradictory, and little is known about long-term outcomes, such as type 2 diabetes, of prenatal exposure., OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to evaluate the effects of prenatal exposure to POP and organophosphate pesticides on fetal markers of glucose metabolism in a sample of newborns from the Pelagie mother-child cohort in Brittany (France)., METHODS: Dialkylphosphate (DAP) metabolites of organophosphate pesticides were measured in maternal urine collected at the beginning of pregnancy. Cord blood was assayed for polychlorinated biphenyl congener 153 (PCB153), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethene (DDE) and other POP. Insulin and adiponectin were determined in cord blood serum (n=268)., RESULTS: A decrease in adiponectin and insulin levels was observed with increasing levels of DDE, but only in girls and not boys. Adiponectin levels were not related to the concentrations of other POP or DAP metabolites. Decreasing insulin levels were observed with increasing PCB153 concentrations. Insulin levels increased with DAP urinary levels. Additional adjustment for BMI z-score at birth modified some of these relations., CONCLUSIONS: Our observations bring support for a potential role of organophosphate pesticides and POP in alterations to glucose metabolism observable at birth.

AB  - Context and Objective: Sexagenarians born large are at lower risk for type 2 diabetes than those born small, a key feature of their body composition being a higher muscle mass, which explains their higher body mass index and also their lower fat-to-lean-mass ratio. Myogenesis is completed in early infancy under the inhibitory control of myostatin. We tested whether large-born infants from nondiabetic mothers develop an early surplus of lean mass while having a lower myostatinemia. Design, Methods, Study Participants, and Main Outcomes: In a longitudinal study (0-4 mo), we compared the body composition and endocrine markers (fasting glucose, insulin, IGF-1, high molecular weight adiponectin) of breast-fed appropriate-vs large-for-gestational-age infants (n = 125) from nondiabetic mothers. Circulating myostatin concentrations were assayed after collection of the above-mentioned data. Setting: The study was conducted at the University Hospital for Women and Children. Intervention: There were no interventions. Results: Between 0-4 months, large-for-gestational-age infants switched from an adipose to a lean body composition (due to a nearly 20% excess of lean mass) and to an insulin-sensitive and hyperadiponectinemic state while having low IGF-1 concentrations and the lowest myostatinemia hitherto reported in the human (all between P <= .01 and P <= .0001). Conclusion: Large-born infants from nondiabetic mothers were found to combine a low myostatinemia with an excess of lean mass. The fetal-neonatal control of myostatinemia deserves further attention because it could become a target of interventions that aim at reducing the risk for diabetes in later life by augmenting myogenesis in early life.

AB  - CONTEXT: Fetal growth restraint, if followed by rapid weight gain, confers risk for adult disease including diabetes. How breast-feeding may lower such risk is poorly understood. OBJECTIVE, STUDY PARTICIPANTS, INTERVENTION, OUTCOMES: In infants born small-for-gestational-age (SGA), we studied the effects of nutrition in early infancy (breast-feeding vs formula-feeding; BRF vs FOF) on weight partitioning and endocrine markers in late infancy. Body composition (by absorptiometry), fasting glycemia, insulin, IGF-I, and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin were assessed at 4 and 12 months in BRF controls born appropriate-for-GA (N = 31) and in SGA infants receiving BRF (N = 48) or FOF (N = 51), the latter being randomized to receive a standard formula (FOF1) or a protein-rich formula (FOF2)., SETTING: The study was conducted in a University Hospital., RESULTS: SGA-BRF infants maintained a low fat mass and normal levels of IGF-I and HMW adiponectin. In contrast, SGA-FOF infants normalized their body composition by gaining more fat; this normalization was accompanied by a marked fall in HMW adiponectinemia and, in FOF2 infants, by elevated IGF-I levels. In late infancy, SGA-BRF infants were most sensitive to insulin, even more sensitive than appropriate-for-GA-BRF controls., CONCLUSIONS: Because the health perspectives are better for SGA-BRF than for SGA-FOF infants, the present results suggest that FOF for SGA infants should aim at maintaining normal IGF-I and HMW-adiponectin levels rather than at normalizing body composition. Nutriceutical research for SGA infants may thus have to be redirected.

AB  - Prenatal growth restraint, if followed by postnatal overweight, confers risk for adult disease including diabetes. The mechanisms whereby neonatal nutrition may modulate such risk are poorly understood. We studied the effects of nutrition (breast-feeding [BRF] vs. formula-feeding [FOF]) on weight partitioning and endocrine state (as judged by high-molecular-weight [HMW] adiponectin and IGF-I) of infants born small for gestational age (SGA). Body composition (by absorptiometry), HMW adiponectin, and IGF-I were assessed at birth and 4 months in BRF infants born appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n = 72) and SGA infants receiving BRF (n = 46) or FOF (n = 56), the latter being randomized to receive a standard (FOF1) or protein-rich formula (FOF2). Compared with AGA-BRF infants, the catchup growth of SGA infants was confined to lean mass, independently of nutrition. Compared with AGA-BRF infants, SGA-BRF infants had normal HMW adiponectin and IGF-I levels at 4 months, whereas SGA-FOF infants had elevated levels of HMW adiponectin (particularly SGA-FOF1) and IGF-I (particularly SGA-FOF2). In conclusion, neonatal nutrition seems to influence endocrinology more readily than body composition of SGA infants. Follow-up will disclose whether the endocrine abnormalities in SGA-FOF infants can serve as early markers of an unfavorable metabolic course and whether they may contribute to design early interventions that prevent subsequent disease, including diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The use of long-term corticosteroids during pregnancy has been growing over the past decades. Corticosteroids can be given when an auto-inflammatory disease like rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is too active. Several studies have shown that long-term corticosteroids use in pregnancy is associated with maternal and fetal adverse outcomes, like preeclampsia, shorter gestational age, lower birth weight, and rapid catch-up growth. These last two outcomes could influence the insulin resistance later in life. Our objective was to investigate whether prednisone use in pregnant women with RA induces insulin resistance in offspring., METHODS: One hundred three children were included after their mother had participated in a prospective cohort study on RA and pregnancy. Forty-two children were in utero exposed to prednisone and 61 were non-exposed. To assess insulin resistance, we measured homeostasis model of assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and serum adiponectin and lipid levels, corrected for body fat distribution., RESULTS: An average of 6 mg prednisone on a daily use gave no difference in mean HOMA-IR (SD) between the children who were prednisone-exposed in utero (1.10 (0.84)) and those non-exposed (1.09 (0.49)). No difference was found in mean adiponectin level, body fat distribution, or lipid levels such as total cholesterol, fasting triglyceride, or high-density lipoprotein., CONCLUSION: Children who are prednisone-exposed in utero (low dose) have no increased risk for insulin resistance at the age of approximately 7 years. These findings are reassuring because the prednisone use during pregnancy is increasing worldwide. Further research has to be performed to evaluate if the insulin resistance remains absent in the future. Key Points * What is already known on this topic-long-term corticosteroids use in pregnancy is associated with fetal adverse outcomes, like lower birth weight and rapid catch-up growth which can influence the insulin resistance later in life. * What this study adds-long-term corticosteroids use in pregnant women with rheumatoid arthritis has no increased risk for insulin resistance in the offspring. * How this study might affect research, practice, or policy-findings are reassuring because prednisone use during pregnancy is increasing worldwide. Further research should evaluate if the insulin resistance remains absent in the future. Copyright © 2022. The Author(s).

AB  - Metabolic malprogramming has been associated with low birth weight; however, the interplay between insulin secretion disruption and adrenal function upon lipid metabolism is unclear in adult offspring from protein-malnourished mothers during the last third of gestation. Thus, we aimed to study the effects of a maternal low-protein diet during the last third of pregnancy on adult offspring metabolism, including pancreatic islet function and morphophysiological aspects of the liver, adrenal gland, white adipose tissue, and pancreas. Virgin female Wistar rats (age 70 d) were mated and fed a protein-restricted diet (4%, intrauterine protein restricted [IUPR]) from day 14 of pregnancy until delivery, whereas control dams were fed a 20.5% protein diet. At age 91 d, their body composition, glucose-insulin homeostasis, ACTH, corticosterone, leptin, adiponectin, lipid profile, pancreatic islet function and liver, adrenal gland, and pancreas morphology were assessed. The birth weights of the IUPR rats were 20% lower than the control rats (P < .001). Adult IUPR rats were heavier, hyperphagic, hyperglycemic, hyperinsulinemic, hyperleptinemic, and hypercorticosteronemic (P < .05) with higher low-densitylipoprotein cholesterol and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, adiponectin, ACTH, and insulin sensitivity index levels (P < .01). The insulinotropic action of glucose and acetylcholine as well as muscarinic and adrenergic receptor function were impaired in the IUPR rats (P < .05). Maternal undernutrition during the last third of gestation disrupts the pancreatic islet insulinotropic response and induces obesity-associated complications. Such alterations lead to a high risk of metabolic syndrome, characterized by insulin resistance, visceral obesity, and lower high-density lipoprotein cholesterol.

AB  - Background: Although lipids transfer through placenta is very limited, modification in dietary fatty acids can lead to implications in fetal and postnatal development. Trans fatty acid (TFA) intake during gestation and lactation have been reported to promote dyslipidemia and increase in pro-inflammatory adipokines in offspring. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether the alterations on pro-inflammatory cytokines and dyslipidemia observed previously in 21-d-old offspring of rats fed a diet containing hydrogenated vegetable fat during gestation and lactation were related to alterations in TLR-4, TRAF-6 and adipo-R1 receptor in white adipose tissue and muscle. On the first day of gestation, rats were randomly divided into two groups: (C) received a control diet, and (T) received a diet enriched with hydrogenated vegetable fat, rich in trans fatty acids. The diets were maintained throughout gestation and lactation. Each mother was given eight male pups. On the 21st day of life the offspring were killed. Blood, soleus and extensor digital longus (EDL) muscles, and retroperitoneal (RET) white adipose tissue were collected. Results: 21-d-old of T rats had higher serum triacylglycerols, cholesterol, and insulin. The Adipo R1 protein expression was lower in RET and higher in EDL of T group than C. TLR-4 protein content in all studied tissues were similar between groups, the same was verified in TRAF-6 protein expression in soleus and EDL. However, TRAF-6 protein expression in RET was higher in T than C. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that maternal ingestion of hydrogenated vegetable fat rich in TFAs during gestation and lactation decrease in Adipo R1 protein expression and increase in TRAF-6 protein expression in retroperitoneal adipose tissue, but not in skeletal muscle, which could contributed for hyperinsulinemia and dyslipidemia observed in their 21-d-old offspring.

AB  - In neonatal medicine, nutritional research is focusing more and more on thrifty phenotype effects, in order to understand and prevent the development of long-term diseases. lschemic placental disease which brings together Gestational diabete, Preeclamptic Toxemia, and Intrauterine Growth Restriction, the "Great Obstetrical Syndromes" (GOS), originates from sugar.and lipid metabolism. Adipokines and metabolomics can be valuable tools for the diagnosis of obstetrical syndromes and addressing nutrition. Inappropriate nutrition, even in the first periods of life, can accelerate the development of chronic metabolic diseases, especially in the pediatric age. The purpose of this review is firstly to critically examine the information provided by the studies of metabolomics on GOS's and better understand their origin. Secondly, it reflects on the IUGR metabolism and on applications of metabolomics in nutrition and its "nutrimetabolomic" effects and then to discuss the principles that guide nutrition of IUGR children in the light of these.

AB  - The serum adiponectin/leptin ratio (A/L ratio) is a surrogate marker of insulin sensitivity. Pre-eclampsia (PE) is associated with maternal metabolic syndrome and occasionally impaired fetal growth. We assessed whether the A/L ratio in first-trimester maternal serum was associated with PE and/or birth weight. Adiponectin and leptin were quantitated in first-trimester blood samples (gestational week 10+3-13+6) from 126 women who later developed PE with proteinuria (98 mild PE; 21 severe PE; 7 HELLP syndrome), and 297 controls, recruited from the Copenhagen First-Trimester Screening Study. The A/L ratio was reduced in PE pregnancies, median 0.17 (IQR: 0.12-0.27) compared with controls, median 0.32 (IQR: 0.19-0.62) (p < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression showed that PE was negatively associated with log A/L ratio independent of maternal BMI (odds ratio = 0.315, 95% CI = 0.191 to 0.519). Adiponectin (AUC = 0.632) and PAPP-A (AUC = 0.605) were negatively associated with PE, and leptin (AUC = 0.712) was positively associated with PE. However, the A/L ratio was a better predictor of PE (AUC = 0.737), albeit not clinically relevant as a single marker. No significant association was found between A/L ratio and clinical severity of pre-eclampsia or preterm birth. PE was associated with a significantly lower relative birth weight (p < 0.001). A significant negative correlation was found between relative birth weight and A/L ratio in controls (beta = -0.165, p < 0.05) but not in PE pregnancies), independent of maternal BMI. After correction for maternal BMI, leptin was significantly associated with relative birth weight (beta = 2.98, p < 0.05), while adiponectin was not significantly associated. Our findings suggest that an impairment of the A/L ratio (as seen in metabolic syndrome) in the first trimester is characteristic of PE, while aberrant fetal growth in PE is not dependent on insulin sensitivity, but rather on leptin-associated pathways.

AB  - Leptin is secreted by the placenta and has a multi-facetted role in the regulation of functions related to pregnancy. Metabolic disorders and insufficient homeostatic compensatory mechanisms involving leptin during pregnancy play a decisive role in the development of pre-eclampsia (PE) and give rise to compromised intrauterine growth conditions and aberrant birth weight of offspring. This review was compiled to elucidate the metabolic background of PE and its relationship with adverse intrauterine growth conditions through the examination of leptin as well as to describe possible mechanisms linking leptin to fetal growth restriction. This review illustrates that leptin in PE is dysregulated in maternal, fetal, and placental compartments. There is no single set of unifying mechanisms within the spectrum of PE, and regulatory mechanisms involving leptin are specific to each situation. We conclude that dysregulated leptin is involved in fetal growth at many levels through complex interactions with parallel pregnancy systems and probably throughout the entirety of pregnancy.

AB  - Reproductive success consists of a sequential events chronology, starting with the ovum fertilization, implantation of the embryo, placentation, and cellular processes like proliferation, apoptosis, angiogenesis, endocrinology, or metabolic changes, which taken together finally conduct the birth of healthy offspring. Currently, many factors are known that affect the regulation and proper maintenance of pregnancy in humans, domestic animals, or rodents. Among the determinants of reproductive success should be distinguished: the maternal microenvironment, genes, and proteins as well as numerous pregnancy hormones that regulate the most important processes and ensure organism homeostasis. It is well known that white adipose tissue, as the largest endocrine gland in our body, participates in the synthesis and secretion of numerous hormones belonging to the adipokine family, which also may regulate the course of pregnancy. Unfortunately, overweight and obesity lead to the expansion of adipose tissue in the body, and its excess in both women and animals contributes to changes in the synthesis and release of adipokines, which in turn translates into dramatic changes during pregnancy, including those taking place in the organ that is crucial for the proper progress of pregnancy, i.e. the placenta. In this chapter, we are summarizing the current knowledge about levels of adipokines and their role in the placenta, taking into account the physiological and pathological conditions of pregnancy, e.g. gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, or intrauterine growth restriction in humans, domestic animals, and rodents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adiponectin (APN) may play a role in adapting energy metabolism at the maternal-fetal unit. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between placental APN mRNA expression, maternal serum APN concentration and umbilical cord serum APN concentration in full-term healthy newborns., METHODS: Serum APN levels were compared in 46 samples (23 from healthy newborns; gestational age 37.0 to 41.5 weeks) and their mothers (n=23). The APN concentration was measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We analyzed the mRNA expression profile of APN in 22 placenta tissue samples using real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)., RESULTS: The highest APN serum concentrations were found in umbilical cord blood, these were significantly higher than maternal APN levels (mean concentration+/-SD; 38.48+/-12.8 vs. 6.6+/-2.3 mug/mL, p<0.001). Otherwise, there were no significant correlation between maternal APN and umbilical cord APN concentration. APN gene expression was very low and only found in 8 out of 22 placentas. There were no significant correlation between placental APN mRNA and umbilical cord serum APN or maternal serum APN concentration. Umbilical cord APN concentrations were positively associated with birth weight (r=0.535; p=0.012) and gestational age (r=0.559; p=0.013). Maternal APN concentration revealed a negative correlation between maternal body weight (r=-0.623; p=0.009) and body mass index (BMI) (r=-0.634; p=0.008) at delivery. Additionally, no significant correlation was found between newborn birth weight and maternal weight., CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that high serum APN concentrations in umbilical cord blood are not regulated by placental APN mRNA gene expression. The high concentration of APN in cord blood is independent from maternal APN concentration, suggesting an important physiological role of APN and implicating that umbilical APN concentration reflects its exclusive production by fetal tissues.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify parameters that may assist clinicians in predicting which women will develop preeclampsia (PE) after initially presenting with gestational hypertension (GH)., METHODS: 118 women were recruited to the study with GH or PE. They were divided into three groups based on their diagnosis at delivery- (1) GH, (2) PE from the time of presentation, (3) those with an initial diagnosis of GH who progressed to PE. Women underwent 24 hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) and had serum estrogen, progesterone, beta-HCG, leptin and adiponectin measured as possible predictors of transformation of GH to PE., RESULTS: Women who presented with GH, and progressed to PE, presented four weeks earlier (33 vs 37 weeks, p < 0.001) than those who did not progress. Women with PE, either as their initial diagnosis or after progression from GH, were delivered earlier (p < 0.001) and had more small for gestational age (SGA) babies than women with GH at delivery (p < 0.05). Those who developed PE after presenting with GH generally had higher blood pressures than those who remained as GH, significant for awake and 24 hour systolic blood pressures (p < 0.05). beta-HCG, estrogen, progesterone or leptin values were similar across the groups. Adiponectin was higher in women with established PE at presentation compared to women with GH (p = 0.02) but adiponectin failed to discriminate those women with an initial diagnosis of GH who progressed to PE., CONCLUSION: 24 hr ABPM may provide a non-invasive method of identifying this 'at risk' GH population, particularly in the case of early presentation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Singleton infants with intrauterine growth restriction have an adaptive hormonal profile characterized by decreased levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-3 and insulin and elevated levels of IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-2. This study examined the association between cord serum levels of six growth factors and anthropometric features at birth in twins in order to determine the intrauterine growth factor interactions and to characterize the specific hormonal profile of small discordant twins., DESIGN: Prevalent case-control study., PATIENTS: Twenty pairs of discordant twins (5 monozygotic, 15 dizygotic) and 20 pairs of concordant twins (6 monozygotic, 14 dizygotic) matched for gestational age., MEASUREMENTS: Cord blood levels of IGF-1, IGF-2, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-3, insulin, leptin and anthropometric measurements at birth. Intra- and inter-pair differences and correlation coefficients were calculated, and the data were fitted to multivariate regression models., RESULTS: In both discordant and concordant groups, the smaller twins had a significantly lower level of IGF-1 (P < 0.03) and significantly higher level of IGFBP-1 (P < 0.02) than their larger cotwins. IGFBP-1 was inversely correlated with IGF-1 (P < 0.05). Insulin levels were significantly higher in the smaller discordant than the smaller concordant twins (P < 0.001) and in the larger discordant than the larger concordant twins (P < 0.004). Among the monozygotic twins, the leptin level was significantly higher in the larger discordant than the larger concordant twins (P < 0.025). Percentage birth weight discordancy was statistically correlated with twin-pair differences in IGF-1 and IGFBP-1., CONCLUSIONS: Of the six factors studied, IGF-1 appears to be the main indicator of intrauterine growth. Twin discordancy may involve compensatory rather than adaptive mechanisms or a multihormone relative resistance syndrome.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic autoimmune neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by demyelination, neuronal loss, and permanent neurological impairments. The etiology of MS is not clearly understood, but genetics and environmental factors can affect the susceptibility of individuals. Obesity or a body mass index of (BMI)>30kg/m2 is associated with serious health consequences such as lipid profile abnormalities, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, reduced levels of vitamin D, and a systemic low-grade inflammatory state. The inflammatory milieu can negatively affect the CNS and promote MS pathogenesis due in part to the increased blood-brain barrier permeability by the actions of adipose tissue-derived cytokines or adipokines. By crossing the blood-brain barrier, the pro-inflammatory adipokines such as leptin, resistin, and visfatin activate the CNS-resident immune cells, and promote the inflammatory responses; subsequently, demyelinating lesions occur in the white matter of the brain and spinal cord. Therefore, better knowledge of the adipokines' role in the induction of obesity-related chronic inflammation and subsequent events leading to the dysfunctional blood-brain barrier is essential. In this review, recent evidence regarding the possible roles of obesity and its related systemic low-grade inflammation, and the roles of adipokines and their genetic variants in the modulation of immune responses and altered blood-brain barrier permeability in MS patients, has been elucidated. Besides, the results of the current studies regarding the potential use of adipokines in predicting MS disease severity and response to treatment have been explored.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We sought to investigate the relationship between a panel of angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers measured in midpregnancy and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa., STUDY DESIGN: Concentrations of 18 angiogenic and inflammatory biomarkers were determined in 432 pregnant women in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, who participated in a trial examining the effect of multivitamins on pregnancy outcomes. Infants falling below the 10th percentile of birthweight for gestational age relative to the applied growth standards were considered SGA. Multivariate binomial regression models with the log link function were used to determine the relative risk of SGA associated with increasing quartiles of each biomarker. Restricted cubic splines were used to test for nonlinearity of these associations., RESULTS: A total of 60 participants (13.9%) gave birth to SGA infants. Compared to those in the first quartile, the risk of SGA was reduced among those in the fourth quartiles of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (adjusted risk ratio [RR], 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.19-0.74), placental growth factor (adjusted RR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.12-0.61), soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (adjusted RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.23-1.01), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (adjusted RR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.25-0.92), and leptin (adjusted RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.22-0.96)., CONCLUSION: Our findings provide evidence of altered angiogenic and inflammatory mediators, at midpregnancy, in women who went on to deliver SGA infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Being born as large for gestational age (LGA) has an increased risk of developing insulin resistance. Hypoadiponectinaemia is associated with insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate adiponectin levels and insulin resistance in association with body composition in LGA born non-obese children at prepubertal ages., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-five (17 female and 18 male) LGA born non-obese children (mean age 4.8 +/- 0.3 years) were evaluated with respect to glucose, insulin, IGFBP-1, leptin, adiponectin levels and body composition by DEXA. Their data were compared to that of non-obese 49 (20 female, 29 male) appropriate for gestational age (AGA) children (mean age 3.8 +/- 0.1 year)., RESULTS: LGA children, who had similar body mass index standard deviation scores (BMI SDS) as AGA children, had significantly higher insulin (P = 0.043) and statistically borderline significant homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) levels (P = 0.054) than those of AGA children. Adiponectin levels were significantly lower in LGA than AGA children (P = 0.004) even after controlling for age, sex and BMI (P = 0.016). IGFBP-1, leptin levels and body composition did not show a difference. When the LGA group was divided into subgroups according to birth weight, the analysis revealed that after controlling for BMI, being an LGA and having a higher birth weight in the upper half were associated with lower adiponectin levels (estimated marginal means of logarithmic adiponectin levels 2.6 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.2 microg/ml, P = 0.042)., CONCLUSION: LGA children have higher insulin and lower adiponectin levels than AGA children in spite of similar BMI. Adiponectin is a better indicator of insulin resistance in LGA children at prepubertal ages and is affected by birth weight.

AB  - AIMS: To evaluate midtrimester amniotic fluid leptin levels in pregnancies subsequently complicated by gestational diabetes., METHODS: We studied 32 pregnant women with gestational diabetes and a control group of 43 normal pregnancies with an adequate gestational age fetus. All underwent a midtrimester amniocentesis: leptin and insulin were measured in the amniotic fluid. Data were compared with the Mann-Whitney U-test., RESULTS: Median leptin concentrations in the amniotic fluid of the gestational diabetes mellitus patients were significantly higher than in the control group (15.1 vs. 7.9 ng/ml) (p = 0.001); amniotic insulin concentrations were also higher in the gestational diabetes mellitus than in the control group (0.67 vs. 0.38 microU/ml) (p = 0.02). Furthermore, amniotic fluid leptin levels were directly correlated with amniotic insulin concentrations; instead, there was no correlation with maternal BMI and birth weight., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that in pregnancies subsequently complicated by gestational diabetes, amniotic fluid leptin and insulin levels are higher in the early fetal period.

AB  - Objective: Adiponectin is an exclusively adipose tissue-derived protein. Low plasma adiponectin levels have been found in hypertensive men. Our objective was to evaluate whether low first-trimester plasma adiponectin values were predictive of hypertensive disorders later in pregnancy. Methods: A nested case-control study was carried out on a cohort of 1,842 pregnant women who participated in the first-trimester Down syndrome screening program; 34 developed preeclampsia and 48 gestational hypertension. A control group of 82 nonhypertensive uneventful pregnancies was selected. Plasma adiponectin was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Results: Adiponectin median concentrations in the group which subsequently became hypertensive were significantly lower than those in the control group (7.6 versus 13.0 mu g/mL) (P < .001). When the 2 hypertensive subgroups were considered, the plasma adiponectin median value in the preeclampsia group was significantly lower than that in the gestational hypertension group (6.6 versus 9.3 mu g/mL) (P = .01). Regression analysis showed an inverse correlation between plasma adiponectin concentrations and maternal age, gestational age, body mass index, systolic blood pressure, and proteinuria. Approximately 34% of hypertensive pregnancies, compared with 7% of controls (P < .001), had plasma adiponectin concentrations less than 6.4 mu g/mL (mean value of lower quartile of distribution among control patients). After adjusting for maternal age, all these women experienced a 6.6-fold (95% confidence interval 2.5-17.8) increased risk of pregnancy hypertension, compared with those women who had higher concentrations Conclusion: Our findings suggest a strong association between hypoadiponectinemia and the risk of hypertensive disorders in pregnancy, especially with preeclampsia.

AB  - Consistent with findings from experimental research in nonhuman primates exposed to early-life stress, children exposed to maltreatment are at high risk of detrimental physical health conditions, such as obesity and systemic inflammation. Because leptin is a key molecule involved in the regulation of both energy balance and immunity, we investigated abnormalities in leptin physiology among maltreated children. We measured leptin, body mass index and C-reactive protein in 170 12-year-old children members of the Environmental-Risk Longitudinal Twin Study, for whom we had prospectively-collected information on maltreatment exposure. We found that maltreated children exhibited blunted elevation in leptin levels in relation to increasing levels of physiological stimuli, adiposity and inflammation, compared with a group of non-maltreated children matched for gender, zygosity and socioeconomic status. These findings were also independent of key potential artifacts and confounders, such as time of day at sample collection, history of food insecurity, pubertal maturation and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, using birth weight as a proxy measure for leptin, we found that physiological abnormalities were presumably not present at birth in children who went on to be maltreated but only emerged over the course of childhood, after maltreatment exposure. Leptin deficiency may contribute to onset, persistence and progression of physical health problems in maltreated children.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the relation between cord blood bisphenol A (BPA), leptin, adiponectin, birth weight, height, skin thickness, and postnatal results. Method: This study was performed in near East University Medical Faculty, Nicosia, Cyprus with 150 healthy newborns. Cord blood leptin, adiponectin, BPA levels were measured by ELISA and birth weight, heights and back, waist, and arm skin thickness were measured and postnatal problems noted. Results: One hundred eighty-seven newborns were included in the study. Mean +/- SD of BPA, adiponectin, leptin levels were 48.3 +/- 2.22 ng/mL, 65.60 +/- 15.29 microg/mL and 3.08 +/- 2.08 ng/mL. Mean birth weight, height, head circumferences were 3156.76 +/- 493.45 g, 48.28 +/- 2.04 cm, 34.14 +/- 1.74 cm. The association anthropometric measurements, BPA, leptin, and adiponectin levels were not statistically significant (p>.05). The relation between cord blood leptin, adiponectin, and BPA levels and small for gestation, large for gestation and average for gestation groups were not significant (p>.05). Moreover, relation between back, waist and arm skin thickness and BPA, leptin, and adiponectin were not statistically significant (p>.05). However, newborns who were hospitalized and had newborn jaundice had higher BPA levels (p<.05). Conclusion: In previous studies, higher BPA levels were associated with small for gestational age (SGA) birth, however, this relation was not noted in our study. Furthermore, there is no relation between skin thickness, BPA, leptin, and adiponectin. This difference may be as a result of higher cord BPA levels compared with previous studies.

AB  - Objectives: Our aim in this study was to compare the values of omentin-1, which is an adipokine associated with postnatal metabolic complications, in the cord blood of newborns who were small for gestational age (SGA), appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and large for gestational age (LGA). Method(s): This prospective, cross-sectional study was carried out with the measurement of omentin-1 values by Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent method in the cord blood of the infants who were born at the delivery room of Ministry of Health, Istanbul Okmeydani Training and Research Hospital between 01/08/2016 and 31/01/2017. Result(s): In the study, omentin-1 values of 30 infants with AGA, 25 infants with LGA and 20 infants with SGA were measured and compared with each other. The mean of cord blood omentin-1 values in the newborn group with SGA was found to be significantly low compared to that of the newborns with AGA. However, no statistically significant difference was found between omentin-1 values of the three groups. Conclusion(s): We have determined serum omentin-1 levels to be lower in infants with SGA. Metabolic follow-up of infants with SGA is thought to be beneficial because low levels of omentin-1, which is an adipokine in metabolic functions in infants with SGA, may lead to the development of metabolic complications.Copyright © 2019, Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the endocrine and cardiometabolic cord blood characteristics of offspring of mothers with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) with those of healthy controls., DESIGN: Cross-sectional case control study., SETTING: University medical centers., PATIENT(S): Offspring from mothers with PCOS (n = 61) and healthy controls (n = 82)., INTERVENTION(S): Cord blood withdrawal from neonates., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Cord blood estradiol, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), testosterone, sex hormone-binding globulin, free androgen index (FAI), insulin, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, c-reactive protein, adiponectin, and leptin., RESULT(S): Androstenedione and leptin concentrations were increased in the offspring of women with PCOS compared with the controls: androstenedione median 2.9 (interquartile range [IQR] 2.3-3.9) nmol/L vs. 2.2 [IQR 1.6-2.7] nmol/L; and leptin median 13.6 [IQR 8.3-22.9] mug/L vs. 9.8 [IQR 6.0-16.5] mug/L. After adjusting for maternal and pregnancy-related confounders (such as maternal age, gestational age, birth weight), androstenedione appeared associated with PCOS in both male (relative change 1.36 [1.04; 1.78]) and female offspring (relative change 1.40 [1.08; 1.82]). Similarly, in male offspring the leptin concentrations appeared associated with PCOS after correction for confounders (relative change 1.55 [1.12; 2.14]). After correction for multiple testing, these associations attenuated., CONCLUSION(S): Observed results suggest that androstenedione concentrations are increased in the cord blood of male and female offspring of women with PCOS, although this requires confirmation. This finding would support the hypothesis that a maternal hyperandrogenic environment during pregnancy in women with PCOS may predispose their offspring to fetal hyperandrogenism. The potential associations between fetal hyperandrogenism and long-term health effects remain to be elucidated., CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT00821379.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Gestational hypertension is one of the most common complications of pregnancy and childbirth worldwide and may be associated with metabolic disorders. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific plasma protein with insulin-sensitizing, vascular-protective, anti-inflammatory properties, and its role in metabolic disorders in prenatal and postnatal development in neonates remains unclear. The primary purpose of this study was to determine whether gestational hypertension is a condition lowering cord blood adiponectin level. Next, we have evaluated whether cord blood adiponectin level correlates with selected anthropometric parameters in neonates., MATERIAL AND METHODS: The case-control study included 89 newborns divided into two groups: 30 neonates in the study group whose mothers were diagnosed with gestational hypertension and 59 healthy neonates born from normotensive pregnancies. Adiponectin determinations were performed in both groups, and neonatal anthropometric measurements and perinatal data were collected., RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.27) between adiponectin concentration in cord blood of newborns from the study group [median (Q1-Q3) 9.86 mug/ml (8.16-13.26 mug/ml)] compared with the control group [median (Q1-Q3) 10.65 mug/ml (8.69-14.29 mug/ml)]. No statistically significant correlations were observed between adiponectin level and gestational age, body weight, body length, and chest circumference. A significant correlation was observed between adiponectin level and head circumference among newborns in the control group and among the entire population of newborns included in the study., CONCLUSION: No significant influence of gestational hypertension on cord blood adiponectin levels or their correlation with neonatal anthropometric measurements was observed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) therapy on insulin sensitivity in short children born small for gestational age (SGA)., STUDY DESIGN: Twelve short (height standard deviation score, -3.2 +/- 0.1) non-GH-deficient children SGA (7 boys/5 girls) were studied at 9.3 +/- 1.0 years of age. The insulin sensitivity index was measured with Bergman's minimal model before (11 children) and during (12 children) rhGH therapy (21 +/- 6 months) administered daily at 20 IU/m(2) per week. No child had a change in pubertal status during the study. In addition, 5 children who remained prepubertal had insulin sensitivity remeasured 3 months after rhGH therapy was suspended., RESULTS: With rhGH therapy, insulin sensitivity fell 44% +/- 10% (P =.018), with a compensatory rise in the acute insulin response of 123% +/- 59% (P <.009). Reassessment of insulin sensitivity in 5 children (3 boys/2 girls) 3 months after suspension of rhGH occurred at 9.9 +/- 0.7 years. Insulin sensitivity remained unchanged after rhGH therapy was stopped: 31.6 (20.5-42.3) before treatment, 11.5 (5.7-24.4) with treatment, and 10.7 (6.2-16.9) 10(-4). min(-1) microU/mL after treatment., CONCLUSIONS: Children SGA are known to have reduced insulin sensitivity. There was a further reduction in insulin sensitivity with rhGH therapy that did not recover 3 months after rhGH therapy was stopped.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the long-term impact of intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) among a diverse, contemporary cohort of U.S. children., DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective cohort of 42 children exposed to IUGR and 464 unexposed who were members of Kaiser Permanente of Colorado. Height and weight measurements since birth and measures of abdominal adiposity and insulin-resistance were measured at an average age of 10.6 (+/-1.3) years., RESULTS: Infants born IUGR experienced "catch-up growth" in the first 12 months of life at a rate of 3.58 kg/m2 compared to 2.36 kg/m2 in unexposed infants (P = 0.01). However, after 1 year of age, no differences in BMI growth velocity were observed. Nevertheless children exposed to IUGR had higher waist circumference (67.0 vs. 65.3 cm, P = 0.03), higher insulin (15.2 vs. 11.0 muU/ml, P = 0.0002), higher HOMA-IR (2.8 vs. 2.3, P = 0.03), and lower adiponectin levels (9.0 vs. 12.0 mug/ml, P = 0.003) in adolescence, independent of other childhood and maternal factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our data from a contemporary US cohort suggests that children exposed to IUGR have increased abdominal fat and increased insulin resistance biomarkers despite no differences in BMI growth patterns beyond 12 months of age. These data provide further support for the fetal programming hypothesis. Copyright © 2013 The Obesity Society.

AB  - The control of fetal growth depends on multiple hormones, including both IGF-I and placental GH (PGH) in the mother, and IGF-I rather than pituitary GH (pitGH) in the fetus. Leptin, which is produced by adipocytes and syncitiotrophoblast cells, has also been thought to influence fetal growth by an as yet unknown mechanism. This study assessed the relationships between the GH-IGF-I axis in mothers and newborns, and maternal smoking, neonate gender, and maternal and fetal leptin. We collected blood in 87 mothers at the onset of labor and cord blood immediately after birth in their 87 healthy full-term newborns. GH concentrations were log(10) transformed, and data were expressed as the geometric mean (-1, +1 tolerance factor). PGH was lower in the 30 smoking mothers, as compared with the 57 nonsmoking mothers [18.2 (11.5; 28.6) vs. 27.0 (15.1; 48.2) microg/liter, P < 0.01]. Cord blood IGF-I was lower in neonates from smoking mothers (90 +/- 44 vs. 135 +/- 65 microg/liter, mean +/- SD, P < 0.01), consistent with their lower birth weight percentile (P < 0.01). A gender effect was observed for PGH, which was higher when the newborn was female, and for newborn pitGH and newborn leptin, which were, respectively, lower and higher in females, even after adjustment for birth weight and maternal smoking category (P < 0.05 for all comparisons). Multiple regression analyses identified maternal leptin as a negative predictor of PGH (P < 0.05) and newborn leptin as a positive predictor of newborn IGF-I (P < 0.05). Maternal smoking is associated to decreased maternal PGH and cord blood IGF-I concentrations. A sexual dimorphism for PGH, newborn pitGH, and newborn leptin exists at the time of birth, but its physiological significance remains to be studied. The relationships between maternal leptin and PGH and between cord blood leptin and IGF-I are consistent with the hypothesis that leptin could contribute to the control of fetal growth.

AB  - Objective: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is associated with adverse maternal and fetal outcomes. This study aimed to identify early and reliable GDM predictors that would enable implementation of preventive and management measures. Methods: The participants were a 28-week prospective cohort of in vitro fertilization (IVF)-conceived pregnant women (<= 39 years, body mass index [BMI] 18.5-38 kg/m(2)) without a known history of diabetes mellitus. Fasting blood samples were analyzed at baseline (pre-IVF) and 12 weeks' gestation for reproductive hormones, glucose, serum insulin, lipids, thyroid function, adiponectin, and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein. At 28 weeks, a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test was used to screen for GDM. Results: For the overall group at baseline, 22% had BMI >= 30 kg/m(2), 45% had polycystic ovary syndrome, 16% had hemoglobin A1C of 5.7% to 6.1%, and 14% had a past history of GDM. At 28 weeks of gestation (n = 158), 34 women had developed GDM and 124 had not. Significant baseline predictors of GDM onset included greater BMI (29.0 vs 25.8 kg/m(2)), older age (34 vs 32 years), higher levels of follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone ratio (1.2 vs 1.0), hemoglobin A1C (5.5 vs 5.2%), insulin (10.6 vs 7.1 mu IU/mL), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (2.2 vs 1.7), total cholesterol (199 vs 171 mg/dL), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (123 vs 105 mg/dL), and lower triglyceride levels (74 vs 76 mg/dL). Significant 12-week GDM predictors included greater maternal weight gain (delta: 3.4 vs 1.5 kg) and higher levels of insulin (11.3 vs 7.6 mu IU/mL), triglycerides (178 vs 120 mg/dL), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (2.3 vs 1.5). Twelve-week BMI is a predictor of GDM following adjustment for polycystic ovary syndrome status and maternal age. Conclusion: While preconception maternal BMI, age, and follicle-stimulating hormone/luteinizing hormone ratio are predictors of subsequent development of GDM, early IVF-conceived gestational weight gain is the best predictor of GDM onset.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is closely linked with metabolic diseases, appetite disorders and obesity at adulthood. Leptin, a major adipokine secreted by adipose tissue, circulates in direct proportion to body fat stores, enters the brain and regulates food intake and energy expenditure. Deficient leptin neuronal signalling favours weight gain by affecting central homeostatic circuitry. The aim of this study was to determine if leptin resistance was programmed by perinatal nutritional environment and to decipher potential cellular mechanisms underneath. We clearly demonstrated that 5 months old IUGR rats develop a decrease of leptin sentivity, characterized by no significant reduction of food intake following an intraperitoneal injection of leptin. Apart from the resistance to leptin injection, results obtained from IUGR rats submitted to rapid catch-up growth differed from those of IUGR rats with no catch-up since we observed, for the first group only, fat accumulation, increased appetite for food rich in fat and increased leptin synthesis. Centrally, the leptin resistant state of both groups was associated with a complex and not always similar changes in leptin receptor signalling steps. Leptin resistance in IUGR rats submitted to rapid catch-up was associated with alteration in AKT and mTOR pathways. Alternatively, in IUGR rats with no catch-up, leptin resistance was associated with low hypothalamic expression of LepRa and LepRb. This study reveals leptin resistance as an early marker of metabolic disorders that appears before any evidence of body weight increase in IUGR rats but whose mechanisms could depend of nutritional environment of the perinatal period.

AB  - The increasing prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in numerous populations throughout the world is currently of major concern, and presents a huge global health problem. The link between low birth weight and the subsequent development of obesity, disrupted glucose homeostasis and hypertension is now well established, and there is extensive evidence supporting these associations in both epidemiological and experimental studies. Alterations in the secretion of, and responses to, the circulating hormones insulin and leptin are likely candidates in terms of disease development. The aim of current research is to define how the central and peripheral pathways in which these signals exert their effects may be disrupted following poor early growth, and how this disruption contributes to the development of metabolic disease. The present review aims to outline the existing evidence whereby alterations in early growth may programme an individual to be at increased risk of the metabolic syndrome. The development of central appetite and expenditure circuits and of peripheral metabolic tissues, are likely to play a key role in the long-term regulation of energy balance.

AB  - Background: Children exposed to gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are at a higher risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes. This susceptibility might involve brown adipose tissue (BAT), which is suspected to protect against obesity. The objective of this study is to assess whether fetal exposure to maternal hyperglycemia is associated with DNA methylation variations in genes involved in BAT genesis and activation. Methods: DNA methylation levels at the PRDM16, BMP7, CTBP2, and PPARGC1a gene loci were measured in placenta samples using bisulfite pyrosequencing in E-21 (n = 133; 33 cases of GDM) and the HumanMethylation450 array in Gen3G (n = 172, all from non-diabetic women) birth cohorts. Glucose tolerance was assessed in all women using an oral glucose tolerance test at the second trimester of pregnancy. Participating women were extensively phenotyped throughout pregnancy, and placenta and cord blood samples were collected at birth. Results: We report that maternal glycemia at the second and third trimester of pregnancy are correlated with variations in DNA methylation levels at PRDM16, BMP7, and PPARGC1a and with cord blood leptin levels. Variations in PRDM16 and PPARGC1a DNA methylation levels were also correlated with cord blood leptin levels. Mediation analyses support that DNA methylation variations at the PPARGC1a gene locus explain 0.8% of the cord blood leptin levels variance independently of maternal fasting glucose levels (p = 0.05). Conclusions: These results suggest that maternal glucose in pregnancy could produce variations in DNA methylation in BAT-related genes and that some of these DNA methylation marks seem to mediate the impact of maternal glycemia on cord blood leptin levels, an adipokine regulating body weight.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Maternal obesity increases risk for childhood obesity, but molecular mechanisms are not well understood. We hypothesized that primary umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) from infants of overweight and obese mothers would harbor transcriptional patterns reflecting offspring obesity risk., SUBJECTS/METHODS: In this observational cohort study, we recruited 13 lean (pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) <25.0 kg m-2) and 24 overweight-obese ('ov-ob', BMI25.0 kg m-2) women. We isolated primary HUVEC, and analyzed both gene expression (Primeview, Affymetrix) and cord blood levels of hormones and adipokines., RESULTS: A total of 142 transcripts were differentially expressed in HUVEC from infants of overweight-obese mothers (false discovery rate, FDR<0.05). Pathway analysis revealed that genes involved in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism were negatively correlated with maternal BMI (FDR<0.05). To test whether these transcriptomic patterns were associated with distinct nutrient exposures in the setting of maternal obesity, we analyzed the cord blood lipidome and noted significant increases in the levels of total free fatty acids (lean: 95.5+/-37.1 mug ml-1, ov-ob: 124.1+/-46.0 mug ml-1, P=0.049), palmitate (lean: 34.5+/-12.7 mug ml-1, ov-ob: 46.3+/-18.4 mug ml-1, P=0.03) and stearate (lean: 20.8+/-8.2 mug ml-1, ov-ob: 29.7+/-17.2 mug ml-1, P=0.04), in infants of overweight-obese mothers., CONCLUSIONS: Prenatal exposure to maternal obesity alters HUVEC expression of genes involved in mitochondrial and lipid metabolism, potentially reflecting developmentally programmed differences in oxidative and lipid metabolism.

AB  - Background: this study has examined the associations aIMT measured in utero during the early third trimester of pregnancy and neonatal and maternal lipid and hormone profile at delivery. Method(s):AGA=97, SGA=57 IUGR=11 were enrolled. The lipid profile (LP), Adiponectin (A), and insulin (I) and leptin (L) were measured in mothers (M) and fetuses (F) at delivery. Data were analyzed by Analyset.it,considering significant p <0.05. Result(s): aIMT was significantly higher in IUGR than SGA and AGA (P <0.05).The LP maternal was significant higher compared to neonatal. The fetal concentration of L is lower than maternal but this difference is only significantly in IUGR (P=0.0343).Fetal L was positively correlated with birthweight (p <0.05).The fetal concentration of LDLox was significantly higher in IUGR than SGA and AGA (P <0.05).There was a hypertrigliceridaemia in SGA and IUGR groups than AGA (P= 0.05) and among SGA fetuses there is a significant positive correlation between fetal aIMT and tryglicerids concentration (P <0.05).There is a negative correlation between oxidized LDL and aIMT that among IUGR and SGA was not significantly positive.A and I have a significant positive correlation between maternal and fetal values.The concentration of A was significantly lower in the M than in the F (P <0.05) while NEFA were higher. Maternal A and NEFA in SGA group were significantly higher than in AGA ones (P <0.05). in SGA we had a significant negative correlation of increased fetal I with low aIMT, while in AGA we had no correlation and in IUGR a non significant positive correlation.There was in a non-significant way a correlation between high aIMT and maternal high I (SGA and IUGR). In AGA there is a significant negative correlation between mother A and fetal aIMT, while in the SGA group the correlation was significantly positive (P <0.05). Conclusion(s): metabolic syndrome of the mother might reflect on the fetal metabolism and probably influence the health of fetal vessels. LP of the mother is correlated with LP of the F and newborns with low birthweight had higher chances to present higher colesterol and LDL. Low birthweight was associated with dislipidemic state as well as high tryglicerids were associated with increase aIMT in IUGR.

AB  - Breast milk (BM) is important for adequate infant development, and it contains bioactive compounds, such as bacteria, cytokines and some adipokines which play a role in infant microbial, metabolic, and immunological maturation. However, little is known about its impact on growth and development in early life. The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of milk microbiota, cytokine, and adipokine profiles on the risk of overweight at 12 months of life to find the possible mechanisms of host-microbe interactions. In this study, BM samples from 100 healthy women collected during 15 d after birth were included. BM microbiota was analysed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and cytokine and adipokine levels were measured by the Luminex approach. In addition, infant weight and length were recorded during the first 12 months and z-scores were obtained according to the WHO databases. Infants were classified as risk of overweight (ROW) and no-risk of overweight (NOROW) based on their body mass index z-score (BMIZ) and infant weight-for-length z-score (WLZ) at 12 months. In order to study host-microbe interactions, epithelial intestinal and mammary cell lines were exposed to milk microbes to assess the host response by interleukin (IL)-6 production as a potential inflammatory marker. BM was dominated by Staphylococcus and Streptococcus genera, and the most abundant cytokines were IL-6 and IL-18. Leptin levels were positively correlated with the pregestational body mass index (BMI). Higher relative abundance of the Streptococcus genus was associated with higher IL-10 and higher relative abundance of the Bifidobacterium genus was associated with lower IL-6 concentrations in milk. Infant WLZ at 12 months could be partially predicted by Streptococcus genus proportions and IL-10 and IL-18 levels in BM. BM microbiota significantly induced cytokine responses in mammary epithelial cells. Higher levels of IL-6 production were observed in mammary cells exposed to BM microbiota from mothers with ROW offspring compared to mothers with NOROW offspring. In conclusion, BM microbiota is related to the cytokine profile. IL-10 and IL-18 levels and the abundance of the Streptococcus genus could affect early infant development. Further research is needed to clarify the specific impact of BM microbiota and cytokines on infant growth and the risk of overweight.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate how resistin and adiponectin (ApN) are involved in maternal energy metabolism and foetal growth., DESIGN: A cross-sectional study., PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: Resistin and ApN were measured in 30 healthy nonpregnant women, 73 pregnant women [10-41 weeks of gestation; 18 with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), five with pregnancy-induce hypertension (PIH), nine with pre-eclampsia (PE), eight with chronic hypertension (CH) and 33 normal] and 40 foetal samples (20-41 weeks of gestation; 18 from GDM mothers and 22 from normal mothers)., RESULTS: Resistin levels were significantly higher in normal pregnant women than in nonpregnant controls (13.7 +/- 2.1 vs. 6.3 +/- 1.6 ng/ml; P < 0.005) and showed a negative correlation with gestational age (P < 0.0001, r = -0.7). Only women with PE presented resistin levels significantly lower than normotensive women of the same gestational age (8.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 17.9 +/- 4.3 ng/ml; P < 0.005). ApN levels, although similar in normal pregnant women to those in nonpregnant controls, were significantly lower in women with GDM (37-41 weeks; 5.2 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.2 +/- 0.8 mg/l; P < 0.0001) and PE (20-37 weeks; 5.0 +/- 0.7 vs. 9.5 +/- 0.7 mg/l; P = 0.008) than those found in normal women matched for gestational age. Resistin was detected in the umbilical venous blood in foetuses from 20 to 41 weeks of gestation. In all newborns, both resistin and ApN levels were significantly higher than those recorded in adult life and did not correlate with maternal levels (P = ns, r = 0.03 for resistin and P = ns, r = -0.3 for ApN). Foetuses from diabetic mothers had ApN significantly lower than normal foetuses (26.8 +/- 2.6 vs. 37.5 +/- 3.5 mg/l; P = 0.02), while resistin levels were similar (17.3 +/- 3.7 vs. 18.2 +/- 1.5 ng/ml; P = ns)., CONCLUSION: The secretion pattern of ApN in normal and complicated pregnancies strongly suggests an involvement of ApN in insulin resistance during gestation, while resistin seems to have a minor role. Moreover, the detection of high levels of resistin and ApN in cord blood during gestation is consistent with a regulatory action of these adipokines on tissue differentiation and foetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ghrelin is a GH secretagog isolated recently from rat stomach and involved in the stimulation of food intake and adiposity in rodents and humans. Moreover, subsequent studies showed that ghrelin is expressed in rat and human placenta, suggesting a possible influence of the peptide on fetal growth. The aim of this study was to evaluate circulating levels of ghrelin in appropriate for gestational age (AGA) or intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetuses., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ghrelin levels between 20 and 39 weeks of gestation were measured in 16 AGA and nine IUGR fetuses in whom blood was collected by cordocentesis performed for prenatal diagnosis of different diseases or during elective cesarean section. In most samples, GH, cortisol and leptin levels were also evaluated. Results are expressed as means+/-S.D. Differences were tested using the Student's t-test with Welch correction. P<0.05 was considered significant., RESULTS: All fetuses showed levels of ghrelin in the umbilical venous blood (100+/-99 pmol/l) that did not correlate with the gestational age or the maternal ghrelin levels. No difference was found between umbilical venous and arterial concentrations, suggesting that fetal tIssues are a source of ghrelin. Ghrelin levels in IUGR fetuses were significantly higher than those found in AGA fetuses (176+/-125 vs 58+/-44 pmol/l; P<0.005). Moreover, in samples obtained at birth, ghrelin concentrations correlated negatively with birth weight (P<0.05). In IUGR fetuses, GH and cortisol concentrations were higher and leptin levels lower than in AGA fetuses, although no significant correlation between these parameters and ghrelin levels was found., CONCLUSION: The presence of ghrelin in the fetal circulation as well as its increase in IUGR fetuses suggest a role of this peptide during intrauterine development.

AB  - Aim: To determine leptin and adiponectin levels in maternal and fetal blood and the possible correlations with metabolic and growth parameters. Patients and Methods: Maternal and neonatal blood samples were collected at delivery and after 72h from birth in 20 pregnant women at third trimester of uncomplicated pregnancy and their babies. Result(s): Maternal leptin and adiponectin levels were significantly lower at 72h from delivery than at birth. Mean leptin concentration was significantly reduced in neonatal blood at 72h after delivery whereas mean adiponectin concentration did not change. A positive correlation was present between leptin and adiponectin levels in fetal blood. Fetal adiponectin levels were significantly correlated with neonatal biometric (cranial circumference) and biochemical (cholesterol and triglycerides) parameters. Conclusion(s): The different correlation of adipokines concentrations in fetus and adults could be due to a different metabolism of fatty acids during prenatal life or to factors that regulate adiponectin secretion from fetal adipocyte. It is not known the role of these two adipokines during pregnancy, growth and fetal development, however the findings suggest that leptin and adiponectin participate in fetal development of the system that regulates energetic homeostasis and endocrine feed-back between adipose tissue, central nervous system (hypothalamus) and peripheral tissues (pancreas, skeleton muscles, etc). © Copyright 2007, CIC Edizioni Internazionali, Roma.

AB  - Adiponectin (ApN), an adipocytokine expressed in adipocytes with antidiabetic and antiatherogenic actions, has been detected in cord blood, suggesting a putative role in intrauterine fetal development. The aim of this study was to confirm the presence of ApN in the fetal circulation and directly investigate ApN expression in fetal tissues. The study showed high ApN levels in umbilical venous blood from fetuses [n = 44; 31.2 +/- 14.1 (sd) mg/liter in umbilical vs. 8.4 +/- 4.0 in maternal circulation (P < 0.0001)] that positively correlated with gestational age. By using RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry, ApN was detected in several fetal tissues at mid- and late gestation (from 14 to 36 wk) but not in the placenta. ApN was expressed in tissues of mesodermic origin, i.e. brown and white adipocytes, skeletal muscle fibers of diaphragm and iliopsoas, smooth muscle cells of small intestine and arterial walls, perineurium and renal capsule, and tissues of ectodermal origin, i.e. epidermis and ocular lens. The distribution of ApN expression in nonadipose tissues showed a general decline during the progression of gestation. The unexpected pattern of ApN expression in the human fetus may account for the high ApN levels in cord blood and predicts novel roles for ApN during fetal development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipocytokines participate in the regulation of glucose metabolism and fetal development. The transcription factor activating protein 2B (TFAP2beta) has been associated with adipocytokine regulation, and gene variations with type 2 diabetes and obesity. This study investigated associations between maternal TFAP2B variation, adipocytokine levels, and maternal and neonatal anthropometric characteristics., DESIGN AND METHODS: A population-based sample of women was followed from delivery to 6 months postpartum. Adiponectin, leptin, and interleukin-6 levels at delivery, and maternal as well as neonatal anthropometric variables were assessed. The TFAP2beta intron 1 variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) was genotyped., RESULTS: Maternal interleukin-6 correlated positively with leptin at delivery, with peripartum weight changes and weight of newborn males, adjusted for potential confounders. Leptin at delivery was associated with TFAP2beta intron 1 VNTR genotype, adjusted for confounders, maternal weight and negatively with birth weight among female neonates. A path model suggested a link between TFAP2beta genotype, leptin levels, and newborn females' weight., CONCLUSIONS: The present results stress a role for the TFAP2 beta in adiposity-related conditions and intrauterine growth. The association between neonatal birth weight and maternal adipocytokine levels, together with the observed sex effect, call for further studies on the mechanisms behind neuroendocrine fetal programming.

AB  - Context. Adipokines secreted by fat cells are vital to the control of energy metabolism, communicating the nutrient status with the tissues responsible for controlling both energy intake and expenditure and insulin sensitivity. Objective. We aimed to prove in an experimental animal study that maternal obesity has long term adverse fetal metabolic consequences, which pass on even to the next generation of descendants. Design. The effects of maternal obesity have been studied on animal model using 50 obese female Wistar rats, in which we induced obesity by high-calorie high-fat diet administered by gavage. Subjects and Methods. Obese rat females were sacrificed at gestation term and we analyzed the secretion of adipokines from maternal venous blood: leptin and adiponectin, placental, pancreatic, liver and brain homogenates lipid peroxidation levels estimated by: MDA (malonyl-dialdehyde), total thiols and GSH - as antioxidant factors and routine biochemistry. Results. Low levels of adiponectin and increased levels of leptin positively correlated with the value of placental and fetal tissue lipid peroxidation (from the liver, pancreas and brain) measured by elevated MDA and total thiols and low levels of GSH. The lipid peroxidation in the organs examined generated consistent results, showing high levels of peroxidation expressed through high values of MDA in the groups with Omega 6 supplements respectively no supplementation, and low levels of antioxidants expressed through glutathione and thiols. Conclusions. Endocrine secretion of adipokines from the adipocytes and the recruited macrophages of obese mothers is positively correlated with placental and tissue lipid peroxidation level and routine biochemical parameters.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Most human research on leptin has involved well-nourished subjects or clinical states such as anorexia nervosa or cancer cachexia., OBJECTIVE: We studied the development of leptin as a monitor of energy status in young African infants whose growth patterns probably reflect the evolutionary norm., DESIGN: We enrolled a prospective birth cohort of 138 rural Gambian mother-infant pairs. Plasma leptin was analyzed in maternal blood in late pregnancy, in cord blood, and at 8, 16, and 52 wk in the infants. Body mass index (BMI; in kg/m2) was used as a proxy for fatness. The mothers were lean (BMI: 21.6+/-2.5), and the infants grew poorly compared with Western standards (average weight-for-age z score of -1.9 at 52 wk)., RESULTS: Maternal and cord blood leptin and birth weight were all positively correlated. Throughout infancy, leptin was highly correlated with BMI. A strong sex difference existed at birth (ie, leptin concentrations were significantly higher in females than in males), disappeared at 8 wk, and reappeared at 16 and 52 wk. Absolute leptin concentrations declined by almost 90% from birth to 52 wk, but leptin's ability to discriminate across a range of BMI values improved with age. In early infancy, leptin concentrations were uncorrelated with recent changes in BMI, but, by 52 wk, leptin was able to assess both the size of energy stores and the direction of recent changes., CONCLUSIONS: Leptin concentrations signal energy status from fetal life onward. As infancy progresses, leptin's power to discriminate both chronic and dynamic energy status increases, and this discrimination is achieved at much lower circulating peptide concentrations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Physical activity performed while pregnant is beneficially associated with maternal cardiovascular health. It is unknown if benefits extend to neonatal cardiovascular health. This study investigated associations of maternal physical activity with neonatal cord blood lipid and lipoprotein concentrations., METHODS: Cord blood lipids were measured at birth in a pseudorandomly selected subgroup of Born in Bradford birth cohort participants (N = 1634). Pregnant women were grouped into 4 activity categories (inactive/somewhat active/moderately active/active) based on their self-reported physical activity at 26- to 28-weeks gestation. Regression was used to calculate adjusted mean differences in neonatal cord blood lipid concentrations among the 4 groups of physical activity., RESULTS: Maternal physical activity was associated with higher neonatal cord blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Cord blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was higher in neonates of women who were somewhat and moderately active compared with neonates of women who were inactive. There were no associations of pregnancy physical activity with triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein, very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or adiponectin levels., CONCLUSIONS: Maternal physical activity is favorably associated with neonatal cord blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels. This novel beneficial finding highlights the potential for physical activity in pregnancy to aid the early prevention of cardiovascular disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure amniotic fluid leptin levels in fetuses with twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) with and without placental insufficiency (PI) and determine its usefulness as a biomarker of PI., STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective case control study of TTTS stage III patients from 2009 to 2011 was conducted. Cases were pregnancies with PI (TTTS-PI, n = 18) matched by stage, gestational age, and degree of cardiomyopathy to controls without PI (TTTS, n = 26). PI was strictly defined using biometric parameters. Amniotic fluid from recipient twins (RT) was taken during second trimester fetoscopic laser therapy. Leptin concentrations were determined and compared to growth parameters and birth weight., RESULTS: RT-adjusted leptin was 66% higher in TTTS-PI (p = 0.016) compared to TTTS controls. Cases had significantly higher growth discordance (p = 0.004) and lower RT birth weight (p = 0.041) compared to controls. Significantly higher adjusted leptin levels were observed at birth in the TTTS-PI group when comparing those with SGA donor twins to those of normal weight (p = 0.016)., CONCLUSION: These data suggest a role for leptin in pregnancies complicated by TTTS with placental insufficiency. However, further studies are needed to define its mechanism and potential role as a biomarker in amniotic fluid for placental pathophysiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hypoglycaemia is common in preterm and intrauterine growth retarded (IUGR) newborns. Although preterm and IUGR infants have limited adipose tissue stores, the role of adipose tissue and the associated adipocytokines in glucose physiology is not known., AIM: We report the case of a premature intrauterine growth retarded infant who had poor weight gain for the first 6 weeks of life and then developed severe hypoinsulinaemic hypoketotic hypoglycaemia., RESULTS: There was markedly reduced adiposity with low serum leptin and adiponectin levels. Total energy expenditure and body composition measurements showed that body fat as a percentage of weight averaged 7% at 20 weeks and 28% at 28 weeks. At 20 weeks of age, the patient was equivalent to a deficit of >2 SD scores of body fat, but average fatness by 28 weeks. The hypoglycaemia completely resolved when the patient started gaining weight with an increase in fat mass and a concomitant increase in serum leptin and adiponectin level., CONCLUSIONS: Although the precise mechanism of this patient's severe hypoglycaemia is unclear, further studies are required to understand the role of adipose tissue and adipocytokines in glucose homeostasis in preterm and IUGR infants.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the relationship between leptin levels and fat mass at the time of birth to test the hypothesis that the level of leptin in the fetal circulation is primarily an index of fetal fat mass., METHODS: Leptin concentration was measured in cord blood obtained from the offspring of 42 women. Trimmed, drained placental weight and neonatal morphometrics were obtained after delivery., RESULTS: The ranges in maternal weight (46.7-93.2 kg), weight gain (3.2-22.6 kg), percent body fat (10-34%), placental weight (290-688 g), birth weight (2.63-4.32 kg), neonatal fat mass (179-782 g), and cord blood leptin (1.7-26.7 ng/mL) were wide. The only morphometric variable that explained a significant portion of the variation in cord blood leptin levels was neonatal fat mass (r2 = 0.41), and this relationship was not significantly improved by best subset regression of additional fetal and placental morphometric variables (r2 = 0.46)., CONCLUSION: These data support the hypothesis and suggest that in the fetus, as in the child and the adult, fat mass is the major determinant of circulating leptin levels.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cord blood leptin is an indicator of neonatal fat mass and could shape postnatal adiposity trajectories. Investigating genetic polymorphisms of the leptin receptor gene (LEPR) could help understand the mechanisms involved., OBJECTIVES: We aimed to investigate the association of cord blood leptin level and the LEPR rs9436303 polymorphism, with body mass index (BMI) at adiposity peak (AP) and age at adiposity rebound (AR)., METHODS: In the EDEN cohort, BMI at AP and age at AR were estimated with polynomial mixed models, for 1713 and 1415 children, respectively. Multivariable linear regression models allowed for examining the associations of cord blood leptin level and LEPR rs9436303 genotype with BMI at AP and age at AR adjusted for potential confounders including birth size groups. We also tested interactions between cord blood leptin level and rs9436303 genotype., RESULTS: Increased leptin level was associated with reduced BMI at AP and early age at AR (comparing the highest quintile of leptin level to the others). Rs9436303 G-allele carriage was associated with increased BMI at AP and later age at AR but did not modulate the association with leptin level., CONCLUSION: These results illustrate the role of early life body composition and the intrauterine environment in the programming of adiposity in childhood.

AB  - Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can disrupt metabolism. Early-to-mid pregnancy is characterized by amplified metabolic processes and inflammation to support maternal adaptations and fetal growth. Thus, we cross-sectionally evaluated whether PFAS are individually and jointly associated with these processes in early-to-mid pregnancy. 'Methods: Pregnant Illinois women (n = 452) provided fasted blood samples at median 17 weeks gestation. We quantified serum perfluorononanoic (PFNA), perfluorooctane sulfonic (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic (PFOA), methyl-perfluorooctane sulfonamide acetic acid (Me-PFOSA-AcOH), perfluorohexanesulfonic (PFHxS), perfluorodecanoic (PFDeA), and perfluoroundecanoic (PFUdA) acid. Key outcomes were plasma glucose, insulin, Cpeptide, insulin -like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), adiponectin, leptin, triglycerides, free fatty acids, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein -1 (MCP-1), and interleukin 6. We calculated homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA -IR), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). We evaluated associations of PFAS with each metabolic/inflammatory biomarker individually using covariateadjusted linear regression and jointly using quantile-based g-computation. Results: In linear regression, all PFAS (except Me-PFOSA-AcOH) were negatively associated with insulin, HOMAIR, and leptin, whereas all PFAS were positively associated with HDL cholesterol. We also observed negative associations of some PFAS with TNF-alpha and MCP-1; positive associations with adiponectin and total cholesterol also emerged. Additionally, PFOS was positively, whereas Me-PFOSA-AcOH was negatively, associated with triglycerides and VLDL. Each 25% increase in the PFAS mixture was associated with -31.3% lower insulin (95% CI: -45.8, -12.9), -31.9% lower HOMA-IR (95%CI: -46.4, -13.4), and -9.4% lower leptin (95%CI: -17.3, -0.8), but 7.4% higher HDL cholesterol (95%CI: 4.6, 10.3). For most outcomes, the major contributors to the PFAS mixture often differed compared to single-PFAS analyses. Implications: Individual and joint PFAS exposures were associated with markers of maternal metabolism and inflammation in pregnancy. Further investigation is needed to elucidate possible mechanisms and consequences of these findings.

AB  - Infants born to diabetic mothers have elevated cord blood leptin levels. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the situation persists at the 2nd postnatal day, taking the fasting and satiety states into account and the influence of fetal exposure to hyperinsulinemia, which are proven important contributing factors to plasma leptin levels. Twenty infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes (Group I) and 20 controls (Group II) were included in the study. Groups were similar for sex and anthropometric measurements. Group I had higher leptin concentrations compared to Group II in fasting and satiety states (p < 0.01). Fasting state leptin levels were significantly lower than seen in satiety in both groups (p < 0.01). There was a positive and significant correlation between leptin concentrations and body mass index of infants. Leptin concentrations were positively correlated with plasma insulin levels in Group I. These findings suggest that plasma leptin levels are high in both fasting and satiety states on the 2nd postnatal day in infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes. The possible mechanism underlying this condition is fetal exposure to hyperinsulinemia due to hyperglycemia. The uniqueness of this report are that fasting and satiety states were taken into account and that the data was collected from the samples taken on the 2nd postnatal day, thus reflecting the exact milieu of the infant excluding the effects of the mother and the placenta.

AB  - Obese women offspring have a higher risk of developing chronic diseases associated with an altered immune function. We aim to determine, in neonatal monocyte-derived macrophages, whether maternal obesity is associated with an altered expression and DNA methylation of pro- and anti-inflammatory genes, along with a higher pro-inflammatory response. Cord blood from newborns of obese (Ob) and lean (control) women were obtained at delivery. Monocytes were isolated and differentiated into macrophages, in which M1 (LPS/IFNgamma) and M2 (IL-4) polarization were assayed. The mRNA levels for TNFalpha, IL-1beta, IL-12A, IL-12B, IL-10, and IL-4R were quantified by qPCR and the DNA methylation of candidate genes determined by pyrosequencing., RESULTS: Ob-monocytes had decreased levels of mRNA for pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1beta, IL-10, and IL-12B compared with controls. Conversely, Ob-macrophages showed increased levels of mRNA for TNFalpha, IL-4R, and IL-10 compared with controls. M1 response was comparable between both groups, characterized by an important induction of TNFalpha and IL-1beta. In response to an M2 stimulus, control macrophages showed a decreased expression of inflammatory mediators while Ob-macrophages had an additional suppression of the anti-inflammatory mediator IL-10. Changes in IL-1beta (monocytes) and IL-10 (macrophages) in Ob-monocytes were paralleled by changes in their promoter DNA methylation in fetal monocytes. These results suggest that monocyte-derived macrophages from obese newborns show a basal anti-inflammatory phenotype with an unbalanced response to M1 and M2 polarization stimuli. The presence of changes in DNA methylation of key inflammatory genes in neonatal monocytes suggests an intrauterine programing of immune function by maternal obesity.

AB  - Adiponectin is an adipocytokine with insulin-sensitizing and antiatherogenic properties. Reduced concentrations of adiponectin precede the onset of type 2 diabetes and the development of atherosclerosis. Our aim was to quantify adiponectin concentrations in small for gestational age (SGA) children. Fifty-one SGA children, 24 obese, and 17 short-normal children with birth weight appropriate for gestational age (short-AGA) were studied. The statures of the SGA children were corrected for their midparental height and subdivided into two groups according to their corrected height: catch-up growth group, children with corrected height of 0 z-score or greater (n = 17); and noncatch-up growth group, subjects with corrected height less than 0 z-score (n = 34). SGA children showed adiponectin levels significantly lower than short- normal children (35.2 +/- 3.5 vs. 80.4 +/- 26.6 micro g/ml; P < 0.0001) and obese children (77.5 +/- 39.4 micro g/ml; P < 0.0001). Catch-up growth children showed adiponectin levels significantly lower than noncatch-up growth subjects (29.4 +/- 10.3 vs. 38.1 +/- 11.5 micro g/ml; P = 0.01). Adiponectin concentrations were inversely related to height z-score, corrected stature, weight, and body mass index and were positively related to birth weight. Our results suggest that adiponectin levels are reduced in SGA children and are even lower in those with postnatal catch-up growth. Whether this finding implies a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and atherosclerosis remains to be established.

AB  - The insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system is the dominant endocrine regulator of fetal growth, whereas insulin has a permissive role. Although a role for leptin in fetal growth has been suggested recently, the mechanism by which leptin may be related to fetal growth is not known; but leptin may interact with the IGF system in utero as it does in the extrauterine life. In the context of a hospital-based case control study, we collected anthropometric and demographic data and measured serum leptin, IGF-I, IGF-II, insulin, cortisol, and IGF binding protein 3 concentrations in 142 cord blood samples from full-term deliveries. Cord leptin, IGF-I, and insulin levels correlated positively with birth weight (r = 0.46, r = 0.41, and r = 0.21, respectively, P < 0.01) by univariate analysis and were significantly higher in large-for-gestational-age (LGA) infants, compared with appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants. Cord leptin concentrations correlated with insulin levels (r = 0.36, P < 0.01) but not with IGF-I levels (r = 0.20). Multiple linear and logistic regression analysis demonstrated an independent positive relationship of both leptin and IGF-I with birth weight and AGA/LGA status. The positive association of leptin levels with birth weight and AGA/LGA status cannot be attributed to IGF-I. This suggests the existence of alternative mechanisms underlying leptin's associations with fetal growth that should be further explored.

AB  - Background: Conditions in utero influence intrauterine and postnatal infant growth and a few studies indicate that maternal inflammation and insulin resistance might affect birth and breastfeeding outcomes. Furthermore, hormones in human milk (HM) may influence infant appetite-regulation and thereby milk intake, but the associations are less understood., Objective: (1) To investigate associations between maternal inflammatory, lipid and metabolic markers and birth and breastfeeding outcomes, and (2) to assess predictors of maternal inflammatory, lipid and metabolic markers in pregnancy., Methods: Seventy-one mother-infant dyads participating in the Mothers, Infants and Lactation Quality (MILQ) study were included in the present study. Fasting blood samples were collected around 28th gestational week, and HM samples at three time points from 1.0 to 8.5 months, where milk intake was assessed using 24-h test weighing. Maternal plasma inflammatory, lipid and metabolic markers included high-sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), tumor-necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha), interferon-gamma (IFNgamma), Interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, high-, low-, and very-low-density lipoprotein (HDL, LDL, VLDL), total-cholesterol, triglycerides, leptin, adiponectin, insulin, C-peptide, the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and glucose concentration at t = 120 min following an oral glucose tolerance test. Of these, TNFalpha, IFNgamma, IL-6, IL-8, leptin, adiponectin and insulin were also measured in HM samples., Results: HDL in pregnancy was inversely associated with gestational age (GA) at birth and GA-adjusted birthweight z-score, whereas triglycerides and glucose (t = 120) were positively associated with GA-adjusted birthweight z-score. Higher hs-CRP, VLDL and triglycerides were associated with a higher placental weight. Furthermore, higher HDL, insulin, leptin and HOMA-IR were associated with longer duration of exclusive breastfeeding (EBF). Higher pre-pregnancy BMI was the main predictor of higher levels of hs-CRP, log-TNFalpha, leptin, insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR., Conclusion: Maternal lipid and metabolic markers influenced birthweight z-score and placental weight as well as duration of EBF. Furthermore, pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal age predicted levels of several inflammatory and metabolic markers during pregnancy. Our findings indicate that maternal lipid and metabolic profiles in pregnancy may influence fetal growth and breastfeeding, possibly explained by overweight and/or higher placental weight., Clinical trial registration: https://clinicaltrials.gov/, identifier NCT03254329.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bisphenol A (BPA) is a sealant and flux of plastic materials and has been determined to be an endocrine-disrupting chemical. Prenatal exposure to BPA can lead to substantial adverse effects on fetal growth and development. This study was conducted to assess BPA concentration in pregnant women and umbilical cord blood, and to investigate whether maternal BPA exposure affected fetal outcomes including lower birth weight (LBW), smaller size for gestational age (SGA), and high leptin (HLP) and low adiponectin (LAD) secretion., METHODS: We measured the BPA levels of maternal blood (n = 97) and umbilical cord blood (n = 97) with a high-performance liquid chromatography/UV detector. The protein secretion of leptin and adiponectin were separately determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A logistic regression was performed to estimate the effects of maternal exposure to BPA on LBW, SGA, and adverse action of adipokines in newborns., RESULTS: The geometric means of BPA concentration in maternal blood and fetal cord blood were 2.5 ng/ml and 0.5 ng/ml, respectively. Elevated risks of LBW (OR 2.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.72-3.36), SGA (OR 2.01, 95% CI 1.39-3.01), and adverse action of leptin (OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.12-2.25) and adiponectin (OR 1.25, 95% CI 1.52-3.97) were observed in male neonates in the highest quartile of maternal BPA exposure., CONCLUSIONS: Elevated prenatal BPA exposure increased the risk of LBW, SGA, and adverse actions of adipokines in neonates, especially in male infants. These results provide further evidence that maternal exposure is correlated with adverse birth outcomes. Copyright © 2011 Chou et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Metabolic syndrome comprises central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, glucose intolerance, and insulin resistance. Children sometimes develop metabolic syndrome, and it is strongly associated with the same syndrome in adulthood. Recently, there is evidence that obesity and metabolic syndrome originate from fetal life. Possible explanations of fetal and developmental origin of metabolic syndrome are the thrifty genotype and thrifty phenotype hypothesis, which together confer insulin resistance on developing fetus. Poor nutrition in utero as well as extrauterine growth restriction of preterm infants are important triggers of this hypothesis. Like metabolic syndrome in adulthood, the high levels of inflammatory cytokines and adipokines are certainly characteristic in pediatric patients. Increased fat mass was also observed in these patients, although their birth weight was lower than average. The mitochondrial genome is responsible for the inheritance of obesity from the maternal line. This can be a key as to why the phenotypes of obesity and metabolic syndrome start in fetal life with an association with poor maternal nutrition. In such circumstances, catch-up growth with an over-nutrition strategy can aggravate those features, suggesting that rapid catch-up growth in early infancy should not be encouraged. © Korean Medical Association.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Resistin is a novel hormone secreted by human adipocytes and mononuclear cells. It is expressed in the human placenta, and has been postulated to play a role in the regulation of energy metabolism during pregnancy. However, correlations between umbilical and maternal serum resistin levels and neonatal birth weight remain poorly understood. The purpose of the study was to clarify the correlation between umbilical cord and maternal serum resistin levels and neonatal birth weight., MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study included 37 healthy mothers, neonates. Resistin levels were determined by ELISA, and compared for correlation between umbilical cord and maternal serum resistin levels and neonatal birth weight., RESULTS: The ranges of resistin levels for umbilical and maternal sera were 10.61-40.81 and 1.14-25.54 ng/ml, respectively. Mean umbilical serum resistin level (21.34+/-1.07 ng/ml) was significantly higher than maternal serum resistin level (10.13+/-1.12) (p<0.001). Umbilical serum resistin levels were positively correlated with maternal serum resistin levels (r=0.607, p<0.001) and negatively with neonatal birth weight (r= - 0.345, p=0.037). No significant differences in resistin levels were discovered between the female and male neonates. In addition, there were no correlation between the umbilical resistin levels and maternal body mass indices, umbilical leptin levels, or insulin levels., CONCLUSIONS: It is suggested that resistin not only affects energy homeostasis by existing in high levels in the fetus, but may play an important role in controlling body weight through effective regulation of adipogenesis by negative feedback.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Insulin, growth hormone (GH), and growth factors (insulin-like growth factors [IGFs] and their binding proteins [IGFBPs]) are known to influence fetal growth and also the synthesis/secretion of the recently discovered hormones leptin and ghrelin., METHODS: In 153 delivering mothers and their offspring at birth, we prospectively investigated the association between mothers' and babies' serum concentrations of ghrelin, leptin, insulin, IGF-1, and IGFBP-3 and neonatal anthropometric characteristics and the growth of the fetus. We also tried to put babies' serum glucose and GH measurements in this context., RESULTS: Birth weight (BW), birth length, head circumference, and ponderal index (PI) were positively associated with cord IGF-1, IGFBP-3, and leptin and negatively associated with GH. BW was independently associated with maternal stature and prepartum weight, birth length with maternal stature, PI with maternal insulin and prepartum weight, and head circumference with maternal ghrelin. Compared with preterm infants whose development was appropriate for gestational age (AGA), preterm growth-restricted babies displayed alteration in GH-IGF axis (increased GH and low IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations), low leptin and glucose concentrations, and increased ghrelin concentrations. In large-for-gestational-age (LGA) babies, leptin, IGFBP-3, insulin, and glucose concentrations were significantly higher in asymmetric LGA newborns than in symmetric LGA and AGA newborns., CONCLUSIONS: We found relationships between metabolic factors, fetal growth, and anthropometry. Intrauterine growth restriction involved alteration in the fetal GH-IGF axis, with relatively low leptin and glucose concentrations and increased ghrelin concentrations. Leptin, insulin, and IGFBP-3 delineated subtypes of fetal overgrowth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Factors influencing intraamniotic adiponectin levels and their functional significance remain incompletely elucidated. We prospectively measured adiponectin in amniotic fluid and identified its associations with maternal parameters, mediators in amniotic fluid and pregnancy outcomes., STUDY DESIGN: Mid-trimester amniotic fluid from 571 women was tested for adiponectin, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8 and alpha-amylase by enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), after which clinical data were obtained. Correlations between adiponectin and clinical or laboratory variables were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis, Mann-Whitney and Spearman rank correlation tests., RESULTS: As compared to median levels in 462 women with a term delivery (7.8 ng/mL), adiponectin was elevated in 14 women who subsequently developed preterm premature rupture of membranes (pPROM) (17.3 ng/mL) and 24 women with an iatrogenic preterm birth (IPTB) (13.9 ng/mL) (P=0.0003), but not in 30 women who subsequently had a spontaneous preterm birth with intact membranes (8.1 ng/mL) (P>0.05). Median adiponectin was also elevated in 13 women whose babies developed fetal growth restriction (FGR) (20.6 ng/mL) (P=0.0055) and in 22 women whose babies had respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) (23.0 ng/mL) (P<0.0001). The adiponectin concentration was positively correlated with amylase (P=0.0089) and inversely correlated with maternal body mass index (P=0.0045)., CONCLUSION: Adiponectin is a component of mid-trimester amniotic fluid and its concentration varies with maternal body mass index and subsequent development of pPROM, IPTB, FGR and RDS.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Leptin, one of the peptide hormones secreted by adipocytes, plays a vital part in metabolism, but its role in early-life neurodevelopment remains poorly understood., METHODS: We performed leptin analysis on 323 cord blood samples collected from a birth cohort in Yunnan rural area, China, and assessed infants' neurodevelopment at one year of age by the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development-Third Edition (BSID-III). Multiple linear regression and binary logistic regression models were used to explore the associations between cord blood leptin (CBL) concentrations and infants' neurodevelopment and the ability of CBL to predict the probabilities of infants' neurodevelopment delay., RESULTS: Overall, 323 infants were included in this study. The median concentration of CBL was 4.7 ng/ml. The proportion of 1-year-old infants identified as being neurodevelopmental delayed was 34.5%, and delays in cognitive, language, and motor domains were 11.1%, 26.6%, and 13.9%, respectively. Multiple linear regression analyses manifested that the CBL concentration (log10-transformed) was positively correlated with the cognitive, language, and motor composite scores in infants, respectively (beta = 7.76, 95%CI: 3.81-11.71; beta = 6.73, 95%CI: 3.41-10.06; and beta = 6.88, 95%CI: 3.48-10.29, respectively). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that compared with the higher, lower CBL (< 4.7 ng/ml) yielded a 1.41-fold increase in the risk of language development delay (OR = 2.41,95%CI: 1.42-4.09), a 1.49-fold higher risk of motor development delay (OR = 2.49, 95%CI: 1.25-4.96), and a 1.71-fold higher risk of neurodevelopment delay (OR = 2.71, 95%CI: 1.64-4.48) among infants. The prediction models showed that the probabilities of development delay in infants' language, motor, and neurodevelopment increased with the decline of CBL concentrations [rs = -0.63 (95% CI: -0.71, -0.56), rs = -0.46 (95% CI: -0.55, -0.38), rs = -0.55 (95% CI: -0.63, -0.46), respectively]., CONCLUSION: The decline of CBL was associated with the decrease in infants' neurodevelopment scores at one year of age. CBL below 4.7 ng/ml may increase the risk of infants' neurodevelopment delay. The probabilities of infants' neurodevelopment delay increased with the decrease of CBL concentrations. CBL may be a predictor of the probability of children's neurodevelopment delay. Copyright © 2022. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the protective effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) modified by the LIF gene on the retinal function of diabetic model rats and preliminarily explore the possible mechanism. METHODS: A stably transfected cell line of hUCMSCs overexpressing leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was constructed. Overexpression was verified by fluorescent quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Forty-eight adult Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal control group (group A), streptozotocin-induced diabetic control group ( group B), diabetic rats at 3mo injected with empty vector-transfected hUCMSCs (group C) or injected with LIF-hUCMSCs (group D). Four weeks after the intravitreal injection, analyses in all groups included retinal function using flash electroretinogram (F-ERG), retinal blood vessel examination of retinal flat mounts perfused with fluorescein isothiocyanate-dextran (FITCdextran), and retinal structure examination of sections using hematoxylin and eosin staining. Expression levels of adiponectin (APN), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and neurotrophin-4 (NT-4) in each group was detected using immunohistochemistry, PCR, Western blotting, and ELISA, respectively. RESULTS: A stable transgenic cell line of LIF-hUCMSCs was constructed. F-ERG and FITC-dextran examinations revealed no abnormalities of retinal structure and function in group A, severe damage of the retinal blood vessels and function in group B, and improved retinal structure and function in group C and especially group D. qPCR, ELISA, and Western blot analyses revealed progressively higher APN and NT-4 expression levels in groups B, C, and D than in group A. hs-CRP expression was significantly higher in group B than in groups A, C, and D, and was significantly higher in group C than in group D (P<0.05). CONCLUSION: LIF-hUCMSCs protect the retina of diabetic rats by upregulating APN and NT-4 expression and downregulating hs-CRP expression in the retina.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate prenatal, perinatal, and early childhood factors, including cord and early childhood plasma leptin, on a clinical diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) among children in the Boston Birth Cohort., STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a secondary analysis of 2867 mother-child pairs from the Boston Birth Cohort who were enrolled between 1998 and 2014 at Boston Medical Center and followed from birth to age 16 years. Child's OSA was defined based on clinical diagnoses documented in the medical record. Plasma leptin was measured in cord and early childhood blood samples. Logistic regression was used to examine individual and combined effects of early life factors on the risk of OSA, adjusting for potential confounders., RESULTS: The mean age of the study children was 6.39 years (SD = 3.77); 49.3% were girls, and 209 (7.3%) had ever been diagnosed with OSA. Four significant risk factors for OSA were identified: maternal obesity/diabetes during pregnancy (OR, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.21-2.21; P = .001), preterm/low birth weight (OR, 1.74; 95% CI, 1.30-2.32; P < .001), early childhood obesity (OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.37-2.62; P < .001), and high leptin levels in early childhood (OR, 1.94; 95% CI, 1.22-3.09; P = .005). The presence of all these 4 risk factors significantly amplified the odds of OSA by about 10 times (OR, 9.95; 95% CI, 3.42-28.93; P < .001) compared with those lacking these factors., CONCLUSIONS: Our findings, if further confirmed, provide new insight into the early life risk factors of pediatric OSA and underscore the need for early screening and prevention of OSA among children with those risk factors.

IUGR and NBW piglets were fed diets of either normal nutritional level (NN, 880 kcal/L, 50 g of protein/L) or high nutritional level (HN, 1320 kcal/L, 75 g protein/L) for 21 days. IUGR decreased the average daily dry matter intake (ADMI), the average daily growth (ADG) and leaf fat relative weight. Regardless of body weight, HN could increase the ADMI, ADG and intramuscular fat content, and enhance serum insulin, IGF-I and leptin concentrations, but decreased serum adiponectin concentrations in IUGR piglets. Furthermore, HN could increase the PGC-1a of liver and C/EBPa of longissimus expression in IUGR piglets. These results suggested that the IUGR piglets had lower growth performance and adipose deposition than NBW piglets. However, HN in diets could make up the defect of IUGR piglets in the uterus, and regulated the expression of lipid metabolism genes in some tissues of IUGR piglets.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the association between leptin level, adiponectin level, gestational weight gain, maternal constitutional factors, and the weights at birth and at 1 year of age in infants born to women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM)., Study Design: Fifty-one women with GDM were recruited from June 2011 to September 2011. Leptin and adiponectin levels in maternal and cord blood were measured and their correlations with infant's birth weight and weight after 1 year were evaluated using Pearson correlation analysis. The weight correlations were also determined with maternal constitutional factors., Results: The neonatal birth weight positively correlates with cord blood leptin (r=0.316, p=0.024) and adiponectin (r=0.855, p=0.026) levels. One-year-old infant's weight correlates only with the cord blood adiponectin level (r=0.753, p=0.036). The infant's birth weight had positive correlations with maternal constitutional factors such as prepregnancy weight (r=0.340, p=0.015), prepregnancy BMI (r=0.289, p=0.040), prepartum weight (r=0.404, p=0.003), prepartum BMI (r=0.348, p=0.012), and gestational weight gain (r= 0.280, p=0.047)., Conclusion: The infant's birth weight is closely associated with cord blood levels of both leptin and adiponectin and with pregravid and prepartum maternal obesity. The 1-year weight of infants born to GDM mothers is only associated with levels of adiponectin in cord blood.

AB  - Generating engraftable hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) is an ideal approach for obtaining induced HSCs for cell therapy. However, the path from PSCs to robustly induced HSCs (iHSCs) in vitro remains elusive. We hypothesize that the modification of hematopoietic niche cells by transcription factors facilitates the derivation of induced HSCs from PSCs. The Lhx2 transcription factor is expressed in fetal liver stromal cells but not in fetal blood cells. Knocking out Lhx2 leads to a fetal hematopoietic defect in a cell non-autonomous role. In this study, we demonstrate that the ectopic expression of Lhx2 in OP9 cells (OP9-Lhx2) accelerates the hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs. OP9-Lhx2 significantly increased the yields of hematopoietic progenitor cells via co-culture with PSCs in vitro. Interestingly, the co-injection of OP9-Lhx2 and PSCs into immune deficient mice also increased the proportion of hematopoietic progenitors via the formation of teratomas. The transplantation of phenotypic HSCs from OP9-Lhx2 teratomas but not from the OP9 control supported a transient repopulating capability. The upregulation of Apln gene by Lhx2 is correlated to the hematopoietic commitment property of OP9-Lhx2. Furthermore, the enforced expression of Apln in OP9 cells significantly increased the hematopoietic differentiation of PSCs. These results indicate that OP9-Lhx2 is a good cell line for regeneration of hematopoietic progenitors both in vitro and in vivo. Copyright © 2015. Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Placental insufficiency-induced intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) fetuses have chronic hypoxaemia and elevated plasma catecholamine concentrations. In this study, we determined whether adrenergic responsiveness becomes desensitized in the perirenal adipose tissue of IUGR fetuses and lambs by measuring adrenergic receptor (AR) mRNA and protein levels. We also tested the ability of adrenaline to mobilize non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) in young lambs. Perirenal adipose tissue was collected from IUGR and control fetuses at 133 days of gestational age (dGA) and lambs at 18 days of age (dA). beta(2)-AR mRNA concentrations were 59% and 74% lower (P < 0.05) in IUGR fetuses and lambs compared to controls, respectively, which also resulted in lower protein levels (P < 0.05). No treatment differences were detected for alpha(1A)-, alpha(1B)-, alpha(1D)-, alpha(2A)-, alpha(2B)-, alpha(2C)-, beta(1)- and beta(3)-AR expression. mRNA concentrations were also determined for hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), perilipin (lipid droplet-associated protein), and two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin. Adiponectin and HSL were not different between treatments at either age. Compared to controls, perilipin and leptin mRNA concentrations were lower (P < 0.05) in IUGR fetuses but not in lambs. Because of the beta(2)-AR results, we challenged a second cohort of lambs with exogenous adrenaline at 21 dA. The ability of adrenaline to mobilize NEFA was 55 +/- 15% lower (P < 0.05) in IUGRs than controls. Collectively, our findings indicate that elevated catecholamine exposure in utero causes desensitization of adipose tissue by down-regulation of beta(2)-AR, and this persists in lambs. This impairment in adrenergic stimulated lipolysis might partially explain early onset obesity in IUGR offspring.

AB  - Alcohol exposure during pregnancy is associated with fetal growth restriction and programs the offspring to insulin resistance later in life. The underlying mechanisms are still uncertain, but a dysregulation of gluconeogenesis and adipose hormones may be contributory. Newborn rats from dams that had been given ethanol (EtOH) or water (controls) during pregnancy were studied. Adiponectin mRNA was determined in subcutaneous fat by RT-PCR, and serum adiponectin was measured by RIA. Subsets of rats were killed before and after intraperitoneal administration of insulin, to determine, by RT-PCR, the hepatic expression of gluconeogenic enzymes and that of the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-coactivator (PGC)-1, which promotes gluconeogenesis. EtOH offspring had delayed hypoglycemic response to insulin but normal adiponectin mRNA and serum levels compared with controls. The inhibitory response of the gluconeogenic enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and PGC-1 mRNAs to insulin was blunted in EtOH offspring compared with controls. The data suggest that intrauterine EtOH exposure causes insulin resistance of genes for PGC-1 and PEPCK early in life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Leptin is an adipocyte-derived hormone regulating body weight and energy balance in animals and human being. Although the physiological functions of leptin in human are still unclear, its secretion is closely related to fat mass and energy expenditure in both adults and children. This study investigated whether the plasma leptin level was reduced in connection with the weight loss during the neonatal period and try to find out the role of leptin in body weight regulation and energy balance of premature infants., METHODS: The radioimmunoassay was used to determine the plasma leptin concentration. The first blood samples were obtained at the delivered, and then collected the samples every two days until the infants' body weight recovered to the birth weight or above. At the same time, the essential fluid and energy for the patients were supplied to keep their physiological functions. One person was appointed to take responsibility to examine the body weight, body length and head circumference. Then computed out their Kaup index from the first day to the seventh or twelfth day., RESULTS: A total of 26 premature infants were selected into the study, of which 14 cases were male and 12 female, and their gestational age ranged from 30 to 36 weeks. There was a significantly positive correlation between the premature newborns' body weight loss and their plasma leptin levels (the 1st day: n = 26, r = 0.766; the 3rd day: n = 26, r = 0.636; the 5th day: n = 26, r = 0.629; the 7th day: n = 26, r = 0.717; the 9th-12th day: n = 24, r = 0.587; P < 0.01). The time of body weight loss and the plasma leptin level which declined to extremely low were positively correlated. (r = 0.611, P < 0.01). The time when body weight loss declined to extremely low in 26 premature infants ranged form the 3rd to the 9th day after birth [(5.2 +/- 1.6) day], and that of the plasma leptin levels ranged form the 3rd to the 8th day after birth (4.7 +/- 1.4) day. The maximal ranges of the body weight loss and the plasma leptin decrease in 26 premature infants were (6.5 +/- 3.0)% and (59.6 +/- 11.3)%, respectively. In addition, there were significantly positive correlations among the plasma leptin level, the premature newborns' body length (the 1st day: n = 26, r = 0.609, P < 0.01; the 3rd day: n = 26, r = 0.419, P < 0.05; the 5th day: n = 26, r = 0.583, P < 0.01; the 7th day: n = 26, r = 0.626, P < 0.01; the 9th-12th day: n = 24, r = 0.482; P < 0.05), and the Kaup index (the 1st day: n = 26, r = 0.634; the 3rd day: n = 26, r = 0.534; the 5th day: n = 26, r = 0.542; the 7th day: n = 26, r = 0.611; the 9th-12th day: n = 24, r = 0.539; P < 0.01). Although the head circumference correlated positively with the plasma leptin level at the first week after the delivery (the 1st day: n = 26, r = 0.580, P < 0.01; the 3rd day: n = 26, r = 0.417, P < 0.05; the 5th day: n = 26, r = 0.426; P < 0.01). There was a lower correlation between them one week after the delivery (the 7th day: n = 26, r = 0.369; the 9th-12th day: n = 24, r = 0.323; P > 0.05)., CONCLUSION: There was a significantly positive correlation between the plasma leptin level and the premature newborns weight loss. Leptin may participate in the regulation of energy balance and body weight of premature infants during neonatal life. Leptin may play an important role in growth and development of premature infants.

AB  - High-fat diet and intrauterine growth retardation may predispose to obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. Because prenatal ethanol (ETOH) exposure causes intrauterine growth retardation, we investigated its interactions with postnatal high-fat diet on glucose tolerance and adipocyte-derived hormones in the rat offspring. High-fat-fed offspring had increased adiposity, serum leptin, and muscle uncoupling protein-3, but decreased adiponectin mRNA, compared with corresponding chow-fed groups. ETOH-exposed offspring had normal adiponectin, but increased resistin mRNA and protein, compared with controls, regardless of postnatal diet. Skeletal muscle glucose transporter-4 content was decreased after both ETOH exposure and high-fat feeding. Glycemic and insulin responses to an ip glucose challenge were equally increased in non-ETOH-exposed high-fat-fed offspring and in ETOH-exposed chow-fed offspring, with additive effects of ETOH and high-fat diet. Pancreatic insulin content was elevated only in non-ETOH-exposed high-fat-fed offspring. The data suggest that high-fat diet worsens glucose intolerance in offspring of rats exposed to ETOH. Prenatal ETOH exposure and postnatal high-fat diet might cause insulin resistance through separate mechanisms, involving resistin and adiponectin, respectively.

AB  - The aim of the study was to determine the relationships between maternal smoking, total adiponectin, high molecular weight adiponectin (HMW adiponectin), selected somatomedins, and the birth weight of newborns. A total of 78 women with a healthy, singleton pregnancy, 41 active smokers and 37 non-smokers, and their offspring were studied. Total and HMW adiponectin, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) and 2 (IGFBP-2) were determined in maternal and cord blood by enzyme-link immunosorbent assay. Serum levels of total and HMW adiponectin were lower in smokers compared to the tobacco abstinent in both the mothers (p = 0.013; p = 0.006) and the infants (p = 0.001; p = 0.047). In smoking women and their children, serum concentrations of IGF-I were significantly lower (p = 0.014; p = 0.042), IGFBP-1 significantly higher (p = 0.009; p = 0.039), and IGFBP-2 did not differ from that observed in the non-smoking group. In multivariate analysis performed on the whole group of mothers, the highest impact of serum cotinine and IGFBP-2 levels were indicated for adiponectin and cotinine and the number of cigarettes/day for HMW adiponectin concentration. In correlation analysis estimated separately for smokers and non-smokers, neonatal birth weight was positively associated with total and HMW adiponectin concentrations in umbilical cord blood. Birth weight was also inversely associated with IGFBP-1 and positively correlated with IGF-I levels in maternal serum as well as in cord blood (r = -0.317, p = 0.005; r = -0.294, p = 0.004; r = 0.245, p = 0.031; r = 0.271, p = 0.009, respectively). The present study showed the levels of total and HMW adiponectin in umbilical cord blood may have a significant effect on fetal development. Both IGF-I and IGFBP-1 concentrations also play an essential role in fetal growth, which is an important predictor of birth weight. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy negatively affected adiponectin and the insulin growth factor profile in the serum of women and the cord blood and may be the reason for the lower birth weight of the smokers newborns compared with the nonsmokers offspring.

AB  - Aims. Maternal smoking is considered as a source of oxidative stress, which has been implicated to disrupted adipokines expression in adipose tissue. We examined the relationship between selected adipokines and markers of oxidative stress/antioxidant defence in the umbilical cord of neonates exposed and nonexposed in utero to tobacco smoke. Methods. Subjects including 85 healthy neonates (born to 41 smokers and 44 nonsmokers) were tested for adiponectin, visfatin, oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox-LDL), total oxidant capacity (TOC), and total antioxidant capacity (TAC). Results . Cord serum visfatin, ox-LDL, and TOC were significantly higher (p < 0.001) but adiponectin and TAC were lower (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, resp.) in smoking group than in tobacco abstinents. In whole group of children (adjusted for smoking status, gender, and birth weight) adiponectin showed negative and visfatin positive correlations with ox-LDL. In the model estimated separately for smokers ox-LDL explained 36% of adiponectin and 35.5% of visfatin variance, while in the model of nonsmokers it explained 36.8% and 69.4%, respectively. Conclusion . Maternal smoking enhances oxidative status and depletes antioxidant potential in newborns. Lower level of adiponectin and higher visfatin concentration seem to be related with a less beneficial oxidative stress profile and higher level of lipid peroxidation in neonates exposed and nonexposed in utero to tobacco smoke.

AB  - We examined the effect of tobacco smoking on the concentrations of leptin, soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), total adiponectin, and free leptin index (FLI) in the serum of maternal-cord pairs. We also investigated the correlations between these biochemical parameters and newborn birth weight and length. The study included eighty-five healthy pregnant women, who were divided into smoking and tobacco- abstinent groups according to serum cotinine concentrations. We found that maternal and fetal leptin, sOB-R concentrations, and free leptin index were similar in smoking and tobacco abstinent groups. We observed significant negative relationship between the reported number of cigarettes smoked daily during pregnancy and cord blood leptin (r=-0.37; p<0.05). In the group of smoking women, total serum adiponectin concentrations were significantly lower than in the tobacco abstinent group in mothers as well as in cord blood (p<0.05). A significant negative association between the number of cigarettes smoked per day and total adiponectin concentration in maternal as well as newborn serum was observed (r=-0.38; p<0.05). Umbilical serum leptin, sOB-R, and FLI levels were significantly lower and adiponectin higher compared with maternal concentrations at birth (p<0.05). Mean birth weight and body length of the smoking mothers' infants were significantly lower (p<0.001; p=0.015, respectively) compared with the abstinent group, and negatively correlated with the daily number of cigarettes consumed (birth weight r=-0.39; p<0.05; birth length r=-0.37; p<0.05). Cord blood values of leptin, FLI and adiponectin were significantly correlated with newborn birth weight. We also observed a positive relationship between cord blood adiponectin levels and the birth body length in the two studied groups (r=0.49; p<0.002). Tobacco smoking during pregnancy decreases maternal and fetal serum adiponectin levels but does not have a significant effect on blood leptin concentrations. The direct association between the cord blood values of these adipokines and birth weight and length suggest that rather fetal (not maternal) adiponectin and leptin concentrations may be involved in fetal development during pregnancy.

AB  - ObjectivesThe Extended Mechanistic Growth Function (EMGF) method (Clementi et al. [1999]: Am J Med Genet 87:317-323) is a possible alternative to the Cole and Green LMS method ([1992] Stat Med 11:1305-1319) to construct cross-sectional anthropometric charts. It differs from the technique used by Kuczmarski et al. ([2002]: Vital Health Stat 11:1-190) to trace the CDC growth charts in that all centiles are simultaneously fitted with a single function. The aim of this study is to show how an EMGF model can be designed. MethodsTo illustrate the structure and properties of the EMGF method, the data of the Italian Neonatal Study (Bertino et al. [2010]: J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 51:353-361) were analyzed. The dataset included the birth weight of 45,272 single liveborn babies with gestational ages ranging from 23 to 42 weeks. The EMGF method consists of three steps. In the preliminary step, selected age-dependent raw centiles of the anthropometric trait are computed. In the smoothing step, all centiles are simultaneously fitted with a growth function extended with the inclusion of a few extra parameters. In the transformation step, estimates of the age-dependent L (skewness), M (median), and S (coefficient of variation) parameters are derived. ResultsA four-parameter generalized logistic function, extended with five parameters to model between-sex differences, distance between centiles and their slope, was found to fit the raw centiles of birth weight distribution with a residual standard deviation of 51.3 g. ConclusionsThe EMGF method represents a bridge to link cross-sectional and longitudinal studies and allows us to identify milestones of the median growth in a population in the same way used for individual profiles.

AB  - Background Excess body fat is associated with an increase in risk of type 2 diabetes and hypertension in adulthood and these risks can adversely affect progression of arterial disease. We aimed to assess the impact of lifelong patterns of adiposity on cardiovascular risk factors and carotid intima media thickness (cIMT) in later life in participants in the 1946 British birth cohort study. Methods The National Survey of Health and Development Study was a nationally representative sample of 5362 singleton births to married parents in England, Scotland, and Wales, stratified by social class, during 1 week in March 1946. Our present study is based on the 60% of participants still alive and with a known present address in England, Scotland, or Wales who attended a clinic assessment after invitation aged 60-64 years. We included participants with lifetime adiposity measures, cardiovascular risk factors, and cIMT measured at 60-64 years. Participants were classified as normal weight or overweight or obese at each age (36, 43, 53, and 60-64 years) in adulthood, and childhood overweight was defined. Patterns of BMI change were identified and we used BMI to define adiposity status. We used multivariable linear regression to establish the cross-sectional association of BMI category at age 60-64 years with cIMT, adjusted for various confounders. Findings We included 1273 (45%) of 2856 participants eligible in 2006-10 (at age 60-64 years) in this study. Compared with normal weight, overweight and obesity were associated with higher cIMT (0.029 mm, 95% CI 0.014-0.043) and systolic blood pressure (7.95 mm Hg, 5.86-10.0). Increased cIMT, systolic blood pressure, leptin, prevalence of diabetes, and reduced adiponectin were all associated with duration of exposure to adult adiposity (p<0.0001 for all). We noted little additional effect of childhood overweight. Individuals who dropped a BMI category in adulthood had lower cIMT (-0.034 mm, -0.056 to -0.013) and leptin concentrations (-0.4 ng/mL, -0.47 to -0.32), even when this change was not maintained, than did those who never lost weight. Interpretation Longer exposure to high adiposity in adulthood had a cumulative adverse effect on cardiovascular phenotype in later life. Reductions in BMI category, even if not sustained, were associated with decreases in cIMT and improvements in cardiovascular risk-factor profile, suggesting that weight loss, at any age in adulthood, is worthwhile because it might result in long-term cardiovascular benefit.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Low early-life leptin concentrations may promote faster weight gain in infancy. We aimed to examine the associations between cord blood leptin concentrations and changes in weight and body composition during infancy., DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum leptin was measured at 15 weeks gestation, in umbilical cord blood collected at delivery and at 2 years in 334 children from the Cork Baseline Birth Cohort Study. Body composition was measured at 2 days and 2 months using air displacement plethysmography. Conditional change in weight standard deviation scores over a number of age intervals in the first 2 years and conditional change in fat mass index (FMI) and fat-free mass index (FFMI) (kg/(length)m(2)) between birth and 2 months were calculated and associations with cord blood leptin were examined using linear regression., RESULTS: At birth, cord blood leptin was positively correlated with FMI (r = 0.48, P < 0.001) and showed a weaker correlation with FFMI (r = 0.12, P = 0.05). After adjustment for confounders, higher cord blood leptin (per ng/mL) was associated with slower conditional weight gain between birth and 2 months (beta (95% CI): -0.024 (-0.035, -0.013), P < 0.001) but not over subsequent age intervals. Cord blood leptin was also inversely associated with conditional change in FMI (-0.021 (-0.034, -0.007, P = 0.003) but not FFMI between birth and 2 months., CONCLUSIONS: These are the first data to show that associations between higher cord blood leptin and slower weight gain during infancy are driven by lower increases in adiposity, at least in early infancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ghrelin is secreted by the stomach, the hypothalamus, and the placenta in humans and has growth hormone-secreting and orexigenic properties. Leptin is secreted mainly by the adipocyte, plays a major role in energy balance, and reflects fat mass in infants as well as adults. Leptin and ghrelin central effects are mediated, at least partly, through the neuropeptide Y/Y1 receptor pathway in the hypothalamus., METHODS: We determined whether ghrelin is also present in the fetus and investigated its relationship to leptin, growth hormone, birth weight, and calf and abdominal circumferences in 90 full-term neonates., RESULTS: Immunoreactive ghrelin was detected in all cord samples (mean +/- SD, 187 +/- 88 pmol/L; range, 66-594 pmol/L). In contrast to leptin, ghrelin concentrations of boys and girls were not statistically different. In female neonates, ghrelin is inversely correlated with anthropometric measures. In male neonates, ghrelin is positively correlated with leptin and negatively with growth hormone., CONCLUSION: The presence of significant ghrelin concentrations in all neonates before the first feeding is intriguing. Unlike the fairly constant concentrations and effects of leptin over the short term, the wide variability of ghrelin concentrations observed in newborns raises the possibility that ghrelin secretion causes short-term changes in feeding behavior. We suggest that ghrelin may play a physiologic role in the initiation of feeding.

AB  - Bone marrow and umbilical cord blood are reported to be the main sources of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have been proposed for many clinical applications. This study evaluated and quantitated the differentiation potential of bone marrow-derived MSCs (bmMSCs) and cord blood-derived MSCs (cbMSCs) by in vitro induction. Results indicated that cbMSCs had a significantly stronger osteogenic potential but lower capacity for adipogenic differentiation than bmMSCs. Leptin, an important regulator of mesenchymal differentiation, has a significantly stronger effect of promoting osteogenesis and inhibiting adipogenesis in bmMSCs than in cbMSCs. Moreover, Cbfa1 mRNA expression in bmMSCs and cbMSCs was affected to different degrees by leptin during osteogenesis. In contrast, leptin reduced PPARgamma2 mRNA expression to the same level during adipogenesis in both types of MSCs. These results demonstrate the disparate capacities of MSCs from bone marrow and cord blood and suggest that they be used differently in experimental and therapeutic studies. In addition, the disparate differentiation tendencies of MSCs from different sources should be considered in further applications.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Breastfeeding may protect against excessive weight gain during infancy. However, the breast milk components responsible for this effect are unknown. We examined the variation of three breast milk hormones (adiponectin, leptin and insulin) according to maternal characteristics and determined their association with infant body composition. SUBJECTS/METHODS: We studied a representative subset of 430 breastfed infants in the CHILD birth cohort. Breast milk was collected at 4 months postpartum and hormone concentrations were measured using the MesoScale Discovery System. Weight-for-length (WFL) and body mass index (BMI) z-scores were calculated according to the World Health Organization reference standard from infant anthropometrics measured at 4 months and 1 year. Maternal BMI and demographics were self-reported. RESULTS: Breast milk hormone concentrations varied widely between mothers. The geometric mean (range) was 19.4 (3.7-74.4) ng ml(-1) for adiponectin; 361 (31-3968) pg ml(-1) for leptin; and 589 (53-5557) pg ml(-1) for insulin. Maternal BMI was positively correlated with breast milk insulin (r = +0.40, P<0.0001) and leptin (r = +0.71, P<0.0001), but not adiponectin (r = -0.02, P = 0.68). Breast milk hormone concentrations were also associated with maternal ethnicity, parity and breastfeeding exclusivity at sample collection. Independent of these factors and maternal diabetes, smoking and breastfeeding duration, higher breast milk leptin was associated with lower infant WFL z-score at 4 months (beta -0.67, 95% confidence interval (CI): -1.17, -0.17 for highest vs lowest quintile) and 1 year (beta -0.58, 95% CI: -1.02, -0.14). Insulin showed a U-shaped association, with intermediate concentrations predicting the lowest infant WFL z-score at 4 months (beta -0.51, 95% CI: -0.87, -0.15 for third vs lowest quintile) and 1 year (beta -0.35, 95% CI: -0.66, -0.04). Similar results were seen with infant BMI. Breast milk adiponectin was not significantly associated with infant body composition. CONCLUSIONS: Breast milk hormone concentrations were associated with several fixed and modifiable maternal characteristics. Higher concentrations of leptin and intermediate concentrations of insulin were associated with lower infant WFL in the first year of life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To measure adiponectin levels in maternal serum and umbilical cord serum at delivery, and examine whether or not there are correlations between adiponectin levels and neonatal birthweights, maternal body weights and body mass indexes., STUDY DESIGN: The study included 84 healthy mothers who had given birth to healthy neonates. Adiponectin levels in maternal serum and umbilical cord serum were determined by radioimmunoassay and compared., RESULTS: The ranges of adiponectin levels for umbilical cord serum and maternal serum were 22.7-78.4 microg/ml and 4.0-43.3 microg/ml, respectively. Umbilical serum adiponectin levels (46.9 +/- 1.2 microg/ml) were significantly higher than maternal serum adiponectin levels (16.1 +/- 0.8 micro g/ml) (p < 0.001). No correlation was found between the adiponectin levels in maternal serum and those in umbilical cord serum (r = 0.158, p = 0.151). Umbilical serum adiponectin levels were significantly correlated with both neonatal birthweights (r = 0.454, p < 0.001) and gestational ages at birth (r = 0.295, p = 0.006), but not with maternal serum adiponectin levels. Maternal serum adiponectin levels were only negatively correlated to maternal weights and body mass index at delivery (r = 0.288, p = 0.008; r = 0.372, p < 0.001)., CONCLUSION: The levels of adiponectin were higher in umbilical cord serum than in maternal serum. Moreover, the adiponectin levels in umbilical cord serum were found to correlate positively with neonatal birthweights. Therefore, fetal adiponectin, not maternal serum adiponectin, may be involved in fetal development during late pregnancy.

Leptin levels in 16 amniotic fluid samples collected from small for gestational age (SGA) twin pregnancies were compared with those in 20 amniotic fluid samples collected from non-SGA twin pregnancies., RESULTS: A significant correlation was observed between amniotic fluid leptin levels and gestational age at delivery (r = 0.71, p < 0.001) as well as fetal birthweight (r = 0.72, p < 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between gestational age at delivery and fetal birthweight (r = 0.92, p < 0.001). The average gestational age at delivery was 30.4 +/- 1.4 weeks in the SGA group, with a mean birthweight of 1552 +/- 200 g at delivery. For the non-SGA group, the values were 37.3 +/- 0.5 weeks and 2759 +/- 115 g ( p < 0.001), respectively. Amniotic fluid leptin levels were found to be significantly higher ( p < 0.001) for women in the SGA group (11.4 +/- 1.5 ng/mL) than for those in the non-SGA group (5.4 +/- 0.5 ng/mL)., CONCLUSION: Higher amniotic fluid leptin levels in early second trimester were associated with both lower gestational age at delivery and lower birthweight. Our results suggest that amniotic fluid leptin levels in early second trimester may be a good marker for the prediction of perinatal complications in twin pregnancy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the IGF axis in pre-pubertal children born large for gestational age (LGA) differs from that of those born appropriate for gestational age (AGA)., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The study population consisted of 98 non-obese children aged 5.5-8 yr, of whom 37 were LGA, with birth weight (BW) > 90th percentile, and 61 AGA. The LGA children were subdivided into two subgroups, with BW 90th-97th percentile (no.=24) and BW > 97th percentile (no.=13), respectively. Total and free IGF-I, their binding proteins 1 and 3 (IGFBP-1 and IGFBP-3), leptin, adiponectin, fasting glucose (GF) and insulin (IF) were measured, and the homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR index) was determined., RESULTS: IGF-I, free IGF-I and IGFBP-1 were similar in both groups. Both LGA subgroups had lower IGFBP-3 levels than the AGA group (2.34 +/- 0.61 and 2.70 +/- 0.90, respectively, vs 3.92 +/- 1.1 mug/ml, p < 0.01). Adiponectin was higher in the 90th-97th percentile LGA subgroup than the AGA group (p<0.01). GF and IF were higher in the LGA group (86.5 +/- 5.6 mg/dl, p < 0.01, and 5.84 +/- 2.13 muU/ml, respectively, p < 0.05) than in the AGA group (82.6 +/- 7.7 mg/dl and 4.62 +/- 1.9 muU/ml, respectively), as was the HOMA-IR index (1.27 +/- 0.60 vs 0.94 +/- 0.43, p < 0.01). These three parameters were also found higher in the >97th percentile LGA subgroup., CONCLUSION: The IGF axis was not different in pre-pubertal children born LGA or AGA, with the exception of IGFBP-3, which was lower in the LGA children. In LGA pre-pubertal children the severity of intrauterine overgrowth was associated with the insulin resistance indices.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether being born small for gestational age (SGA) has an impact on adiponectin and leptin levels and the IGF system in relation to insulin sensitivity, taking into consideration the severity of growth restriction., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Serum levels of adiponectin, leptin, fasting glucose, fasting insulin (I(F)), the homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), IGF-1, free IGF-1, IGF-binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and -3, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglycerides were evaluated in 57 children at age 4-10 years. Of these, 32 had been born appropriate size for gestational age (AGA) and 25 SGA (14 in the <3rd percentile and 11 in the 3rd-10th percentile). RESULTS ; The SGA 3rd-10th percentile children were already insulin resistant at prepubertal age (I(F) 39.6 +/- 16.8 vs. 27 +/- 12 pmol/l, P < 0.01, and HOMA-IR 1.4 +/- 0.6 vs. 0.95 +/- 0.42 in SGA vs. AGA children, P < 0.05). Their IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations were significantly lower than those in AGA children (160.4 +/- 66.2 vs. 207 +/- 66.8 microg/l, P < 0.05 and 2.3 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.51 +/- 1.21 mg/l in SGA vs. AGA children, P < 0.01). The SGA <3rd percentile children had higher adiponectin (15.6 +/- 5.7 mg/l, P < 0.05) and IGFBP-1 levels (113.5 +/- 33.9 microg/l, P < 0.05) than AGA children (11.3 +/- 6.6 mg/l and 90.8 +/- 24.2 microg/l, respectively) and lower IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 concentrations (162.6 +/- 68.4 microg/l, P < 0.05 and 2.4 +/- 0.7 mg/l, P < 0.01). They also had significantly lower waist circumference (P < 0.05). Leptin levels did not differ among groups, but an inverse correlation with IGFBP-1 (r = -0.55, P < 0.01) was found in the pooled SGA group., CONCLUSIONS: Intrauterine growth restriction appears to affect the IGF axis at prepubertal age, and its severity plays a role in insulin sensitivity.

AB  - The endocrine system plays an important role in the adaptation to hypoxia. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of chronic hypoxia on insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin levels in a neonatal animal model. Sprague-Dawley rats were placed in a normobaric hypoxic environment at birth. Controls remained in room air. Rats were killed at 2 and 8 weeks of life. Insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and ghrelin were measured. At 2 weeks of life, there was no significant difference in insulin, adiponectin, and leptin levels between the hypoxic and control rats. The only statistically significant difference was found in ghrelin levels, which were lower in the hypoxic group (3.19 +/- 3.35 vs 24.52 +/- 5.09 pg/mL; P < .05). At 8 weeks of life, insulin was significantly higher in the hypoxic group (0.72 +/- 0.14 vs 0.44 +/- 0.26 ng/mL; P < .05) and adiponectin was significantly lower (1257.5 +/- 789.5 vs 7817.3 +/- 8453.7 ng/mL; P < .05). Leptin and ghrelin did not show significant difference in this age group, but leptin level per body weight was higher in the hypoxic group. Finally, we conclude that 2 weeks of continuous neonatal hypoxic exposure leads to a decrease in plasma ghrelin only with no significant change in insulin, adiponectin, and leptin and that 8 weeks of hypoxia leads to a decrease in adiponectin with an increase in insulin despite a significant decrease in weight.

AB  - Maternal obesity (MO) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are common in Western societies, which impair fetal development and predispose offspring to metabolic dysfunction. Placenta is the organ linking the mother to her fetus, and MO suppresses the development of vascular system and expression of nutrient transporters in placenta, thereby affecting fetal development. For maintaining its proper physiological function, placenta is energy demanding, which is met through extensive oxidative phosphorylation. However, the oxidative capacity of placenta is suppressed due to MO and GDM. Recently, several studies showed that physical activity during pregnancy enhances oxidative metabolism and improves placental function, which might be partially mediated by exerkines, referring to cytokines elicited by exercise. In addition, as an endocrine organ, placenta secretes cytokines, termed placentokines, including apelin, superoxide dismutase 3, irisin, and adiponectin, which mediate fetal development and maternal metabolism. Possible molecular mechanisms linking maternal exercise and placentokines to placental and fetal development are further discussed. As an emerging field, up to now, available studies are limited, mostly conducted in rodents. Given the epidemics of obesity and metabolic disorders, as well as the prevalence of maternal sedentary lifestyle, the effects of exercise of pregnant women on placental function and placentokine secretion, as well as their impacts on fetal development, need to be further examined.

AB  - The aims of this prospective study were to detect maternal serum chemerin level in patients with preeclampsia and investigate its association with disease severity and neonatal outcomes. Maternal serum chemerin levels were significantly elevated in severe preeclamptic women (394.72 +/- 100.01 ng/ml) compared to mild preeclamptic women (322.11 +/- 37.60 ng/ml) and healthy pregnant women (199.96 +/- 28.05 ng/ml) (p = .001). Maternal serum chemerin levels were positively correlated with systolic and diastolic blood pressure, C-reactive protein levels, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, proteinuria, AST, ALT, and duration of hospitalisation. Gestational week at delivery, birthweight, and APGAR scores at 1 and 5 min were negatively correlated with maternal serum chemerin level. A maternal serum chemerin level of >252.0 ng/ml indicated preeclampsia with 95.5% sensitivity and 95.7% specificity. There was a positive correlation between maternal serum chemerin level and severity of preeclampsia. Additionally, adverse neonatal outcomes were significantly associated with high maternal serum chemerin levels.

AB  - Children born large for gestational age (LGA) may be at risk for development of obesity and insulin resistance (IR). The reciprocal relationship of adipokines and proinflammatory cytokines is suggested to play a putative role in fine tuning of insulin secretory dynamics. To evaluate serum interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), leptin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations in idiopathic LGA-born children to appropriate for gestational age (AGA) and idiopathic LGA-born children at prepubertal ages and investigate their associations with IR, evaluated by homeostasis model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR), we conducted a cross-sectional study to compare 40 (19 females) idiopathic LGA-born prepubertal children [mean +/- SD age 6.1 +/- 2.5 years] and 49 (25 females) (5.4 +/- 1.8 years) AGA-born BMI-matched peers with respect to anthropometric and laboratory data. Both groups were further divided into subgroups as being obese/overweight (OW) and non-OW, and the analyses were repeated. LGA-born children were taller and heavier than AGA-born children (p < 0.001). Fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and leptin were higher in LGA-born children than in AGA-born counterparts (p < 0.001). Serum TNF-alpha levels were lower and IL-6 levels were significantly higher in LGA- than in AGA-born children (p < 0.001). In the LGA group, TNF-alpha was correlated with HOMA-IR (r = -0.49, p = 0.002). LGA-born non-OW children had higher serum insulin concentrations and HOMA-IR than AGA-born counterparts. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that HOMA-IR was best explained by (R (2) = 0.517) birth weight SDS (beta = +0.418, p = 0.002), leptin (beta = +0.620, p = 0.000), and TNF-alpha (beta = -0.374, p = 0.003) in LGA-born children. Idiopathic LGA-born children have significantly lower TNF-alpha and higher IL-6 levels than AGA-born children. Reduced TNF-alpha levels are associated with increased IR.

AB  - Pregestational obesity is a significant risk factor for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Maternal obesity is associated with a specific proinflammatory, endocrine and metabolic phenotype that may lead to higher supply of nutrients to the feto-placental unit and to excessive fetal fat accumulation. In particular, obesity may influence placental fatty acid (FA) transport in several ways, leading to increased diffusion driving force across the placenta, and to altered placental development, size and exchange surface area. Animal models show that maternal obesity is associated with increased expression of specific FA carriers and inflammatory signaling molecules in placental cotyledonary tissue, resulting in enhanced lipid transfer across the placenta, dislipidemia, fat accumulation and possibly altered development in fetuses. Cell culture experiments confirmed that inflammatory molecules, adipokines and FA, all significantly altered in obesity, are important regulators of placental lipid exchange. Expression studies in placentas of obese-diabetic women found a significant increase in FA binding protein-4 expression and in cellular triglyceride content, resulting in increased triglyceride cord blood concentrations. The expression and activity of carriers involved in placental lipid transport are influenced by the endocrine, inflammatory and metabolic milieu of obesity, and further studies are needed to elucidate the strong association between maternal obesity and fetal overgrowth.

AB  - Knowledge of fetal nutrient supply has greatly increased in the last decade due to the availability of fetal blood samples obtained under relatively steady-state conditions. These studies, together with studies utilizing stable isotope methodologies, have clarified some aspects of the supply of the major nutrients for the fetus such as glucose, amino acids and fatty acids. At the same time, the relevance of intrauterine growth has been recognized not only for the well-being of the neonate and child, but also for later health in adulthood. The major determinants of fetal nutrient availability are maternal nutrition and metabolism together with placental function and metabolism. The regulation of the rate of intrauterine growth is the result of complex interactions between genetic inheritance, endocrine environment and availability of nutrients to the fetus.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) is characterized by the failure of the fetus to grow at a normal rate in utero and is associated with a number of endocrine and metabolic changes. Our knowledge of the placental nutrient supply and the endocrine status of the fetal-placental unit during pregnancies involving IUGR has greatly increased over the past decade as a result of the availability of fetal blood samples obtained under relatively steady state conditions. These studies have provided evidence that the supply of glucose is impaired only under severe conditions, whereas placental transfer of amino acids is reduced even in fetuses with normal oxygenation and feto-placental blood flow. Moreover, significant in utero relationships have been reported between fetal weight and circulating levels of growth factors such as insulin-like growth factor-I and leptin. When measured per kg fetal weight, however, levels of leptin are significantly higher in growth-retarded fetuses, with abnormal feto-placental blood flow and reduced oxygen content. The metabolic and endocrine changes observed should be interpreted in relation to the severity of the disease.

AB  - The relationship between in utero fetal growth and fetal leptin concentrations was investigated between 19 and 41 wk in 40 normal (appropriate for gestational age, AGA) fetuses, in 25 intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) fetuses, and in 18 fetuses from gestational diabetic mothers (GDM), representing different intrauterine growth patterns. Umbilical venous plasma leptin concentrations were determined at the time of either in utero fetal blood sampling or delivery. Plasma leptin was measurable as early as 19 wk of gestation. A significant difference was observed between umbilical venous and arterial plasma leptin concentrations (0.6+/-0.6 ng/mL; p<0.01). In AGA and in IUGR fetuses, significant positive relationships were found between fetal leptin concentrations and both gestational age (p<0.001) and fetal weight (p<0.001). Leptin concentrations were significantly higher in AGA than IUGR only after 34 wk (p<0.05), but leptin per kilogram fetal weight (leptin/kg) was not significantly different. In IUGR with abnormal umbilical arterial Doppler velocimetry and fetal heart rate, leptin/kg significantly higher than in IUGR with normal biophysical and biochemical parameters was found (p<0.05). Both circulating plasma leptin and leptin/kg were significantly higher in GDM than in normal fetuses (p<0.001) and correlated with abdominal fat mass measured by ultrasound. No gender differences were observed in any group of fetuses. These findings indicate a clear relationship between fetal leptin concentrations and fetal fat mass. Data in severe IUGR suggest the presence of increased leptin concentrations associated with in utero signs of fetal distress.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to assess adiponectin, visfatin, HOMA-IR, glucose and triglyceride levels in term, preterm and extremely low birth weight (ELBW) babies. Each of these three groups was subdivided into two groups as small-for-gestational age (SGA), and appropriate-for-gestational age (AGA). 30 term, 30 preterm and 30 extremely low birth weight infants were included into the study., RESULTS: There was no significant difference in term and preterm infants for serum adiponectin, visfatin, and HOMA-IR levels. There were also no significant differences between term and preterm infants for glucose and triglycerides. The serum visfatin, insulin and HOMA-IR levels (p = 0.001, p = 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively) were higher in ELBW group than preterm group. Comparing the subgroups as SGA and AGA in all main groups, only in ELBW group there were no significant differences in serum adiponectin, visfatin, HOMA-IR and insulin levels., CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that visfatin can be used as an early indicator of insulin resistance. Independent of being SGA, ELBW itself may be a risk factor for insulin resistance. In the follow-up of these babies the risk of obesity, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases may be increased as in SGA babies.

AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive value of resistin and visfatin in neonatal sepsis, and to compare these adipocytokines with C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin and interleukin 6 (IL-6)., DONORS AND METHODS: A total of 62 term or near term infants with sepsis proven by positivity of blood culture, and 43 healthy infants were included in this study., RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups as regards birthweight and gestational age. White blood cell count (p= 0.039), CRP levels (p=0.01), procalcitonin levels (p=0.01), IL-6 levels (p= 0.01), visfatin levels (p=0.01) and resistin levels (p=0.01) were significantly higher in septic infants. There was a positive correlation between visfatin, resistin and other markers (WBC, CRP, procalcitonin and IL-6). A cut-off value of 10 ng/mL for visfatin, showed 92% sensitivity and 94% specificity, and a cut-off value of 8 ng/mL for resistin showed 93% sensitivity and 95% specificity for neonatal sepsis., CONCLUSION: In the light of these results, visfatin and resistin can be used as a diagnostic marker similar to CRP, procalcitonin and IL-6 in neonatal sepsis. Further studies are needed to better understand the role and predictive value of these molecules in neonatal sepsis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation of circulating four adipokines (apelin, vaspin, visfatin, adiponectin) with markers of insulin sensitivity in large for gestational age (LGA) infants., PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty LGA infants (20 LGA born from diabetic mothers and 20 LGA born from non-diabetic mothers) and 34 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) infants were recruited. Hyperinsulinism and insulin resistance was evaluated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose-to-insulin ratio (FGIR), quantitative insulin-sensitivity check index (QUICK-I) from fasting samples. Plasma adiponectin and vaspin levels were determined by radioimmunoassay. Determination of visfatin and apelin levels was performed by enzyme immunoassay., RESULTS: HOMA-IR, apelin and visfatin levels (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively) were significantly elevated and adiponectin levels, FGIR and QUICK-I values. (p<0.001, p<0.001, p<0.05, respectively) were significantly lower in the LGA group. Vaspin levels were higher in the LGA group than AGA neonates without a significance. The LGA infants with diabetic mother had significantly higher visfatin, apelin, HOMA-IR values, fasting insulin levels and significantly lower adiponectin, FGIR, QUICK-I values. Apelin and visfatin were correlated positively, and adiponectin was correlated negatively with birthweight, HOMA-IR values and fasting insulin levels., CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, it is too difficult to explain relation between birthweight and these adipocytokines, but findings of high insulin, HOMA-IR, visfatin, apelin and low adiponectin levels in the LGA neonates showed that these adipocytokines can be used as a good predictor for metabolic syndrome.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aims of this study were to examine the relationships between adiponectin, insulin, visfatin and weight at birth in healthy term infants., DESIGN AND METHODS: Anthropometric parameters including weight, length were measured and plasma lipid profiles, insulin, visfatin and adiponectin concentrations in cord blood samples from 50 LGA and 50 AGA singleton infants born at term after uncomplicated pregnancies were assayed., RESULTS: Mean visfatin and adiponectin levels were significantly higher in the LGA group than AGA group (11.8 +/- 8 vs. 6.3 +/- 5.5 ng/ml, p<0.001; 28.4 +/- 3.9 vs. 25.7 +/- 3.6 mug/ml, p=0.001; respectively). Insulin, triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels did not differ significantly between LGA and AGA infants. Cord plasma adiponectin, visfatin and insulin levels correlated significantly and positively with birthweight (p=0.01, p<0.001, p<0.001; respectively) and with birthlength (p=0.01, p<0.001, p=0.01; respectively). Cord plasma adiponectin concentration correlated positively with visfatin level (p=0.005), but not with insulin level (p=0.8), and cord plasma visfatin concentration correlated positively with insulin level (p<0.001)., CONCLUSION: High adiponectin and visfatin levels are present in the cord blood in LGA group. Cord plasma adiponectin and visfatin levels are positively correlated with birthweight. This suggests that adiponectin and visfatin may be involved in regulating fetal growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that women with small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonates would have lower concentrations of leptin compared to women with appropriately grown infants (AGA)., STUDY DESIGN: This is a nested case-control study of normotensive nulliparous women. Cases (n = 28) delivered SGA < 10 percentile and controls (n = 77) delivered AGA. Maternal plasma leptin concentrations were compared at 18, 28, and 40 weeks' gestation via repeated measures., RESULTS: Maternal leptin concentrations at 18 weeks were correlated with prepregnancy BMI (r = 0.69, P < .0001) and early pregnancy waist circumference (r = 0.59, P < .0001). After adjustment for maternal body composition, leptin was lower across pregnancy in women with SGA compared to AGA neonates (13.6 vs 15.2 ng/mL at 18 weeks; 13.6 vs 17.3 ng/mL at 28 weeks; 16.6 vs 20.7 ng/mL at 40 weeks; P = .04)., CONCLUSION: Maternal leptin was correlated with maternal adiposity; however, after adjustment for body composition, leptin was lower across pregnancy in women with SGA.

AB  - Diagnosing asthma in preschool children remains an unsolved challenge, at a time when early identification would allow for better education and treatment to prevent morbidity and lung function deterioration., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if the asthma predictive index (API) can be used as surrogate for asthma diagnosis in preschoolers., METHODS: Birth cohort of 339 pregnant women enrolled at delivery and their offspring, who were followed for atopy, wheezing, and other respiratory illnesses through 30 months of age. The API was determined at 30 months of age by the researchers; and examined its association with physician-diagnosed asthma during the first 30 months, made independently by the primary care physician not involved in the study., RESULTS: Among 307 offspring with complete follow-up, 44 (14.3%) were API+. Maternal body mass index, maternal education, past oral contraceptive use, birthweight, placenta weight, age of daycare at 12 m, gastroesophageal reflux disease at 12 m, acute otitis media at 18 m, bronchiolitis, croup and pneumonia, cord blood adiponectin were all associated with API+. In the multivariable analysis, API+ was associated with almost sixfold odds of asthma diagnosis (adjusted OR = 5.7, 95% CI [2.6-12.3]), after adjusting for the relevant covariates above including respiratory infections like bronchiolitis and pneumonia. The API sensitivity was 48%, specificity 92%, 61% PPV, 88% NPV, 6.4 LR+, 0.56 LR-, 0.84 diagnosis accuracy. The adjusted odds for asthma was 11.4., CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal birth cohort suggests, for first time, that API (a structured definition for asthma), could be used as a diagnostic tool, not only as a prognostic tool, in toddlers and preschoolers.

AB  - Rationale: Maternal obesity is associated with asthma in the offspring. Whether cord blood leptin is associated with risk of asthma in offspring is unclear. Objectives: To assess whether cord blood leptin from women with pregestational obesity predict preschool asthma. Methods: In this birth cohort study, we divided pregnant women into three weight categories during the first obstetric visit: normal (NL), overweight (OW), and obese (OB). Results: We followed the offspring recording atopy, wheezing, and other respiratory illnesses through 30 months of age. Cord blood and peripheral blood at 30 months of age were taken to measure cytokines, adipokines, metabolic biomarkers, and specific immunoglobulin E. Adjusted regression models were used to evaluate the association between maternal obesity and offspring asthma risk, defined by a positive Asthma Predictive Index. Three hundred thirty-nine mothers were recruited; 140 offspring were born from NL, 80 from OW, and 119 from OB mothers. OB women were older and less educated and had higher parity and higher C-section frequency. Offspring from OB women had higher birthweight, head circumference, and placental weight compared with other groups. The proportion of Asthma Predictive Index positive at 30 months of age was 12.2% in the NL, 14.7% in the OW, and 16.8% in the OB group (P = 0.18). Offspring from OB women had higher leptin, leptin/adiponectin ratio, interleukin-10, and insulin than the OW group and higher leptin than the NL group. In the adjusted analysis, offspring from OB mothers with high cord blood leptin had increased risk of asthma (adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.55; P = 0.003). Conclusions: Offspring from obese mothers with high cord blood leptin have 30% higher asthma risk at age 3.Clinical trial registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02903134).

AB  - Increased maternal blood concentrations of leptin and decreased adiponectin levels, which are common disturbances in obesity, may be involved in offspring adiposity by programming fetal adipose tissue development. The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between maternal leptin and adiponectin concentrations and newborn adiposity. This was a cross-sectional study involving 210 healthy mother-newborn pairs from a public maternity hospital in Sao Paulo, Brazil. Maternal blood samples were collected after delivery and leptin and adiponectin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Newborn body composition was estimated by air displacement plethysmography. The association between maternal leptin and adiponectin concentrations and newborn adiposity (fat mass percentage, FM%) was evaluated by multiple linear regression, controlling for maternal age, socioeconomic status, parity, pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), weight gain, gestational age, and newborn age at the time of measurement. No relationship was found between maternal leptin and FM% of male or female newborn infants. Maternal adiponectin (p = 0.001) and pre-pregnancy BMI (p < 0.001; adj. R-2 = 0.19) were positively associated with FM% of newborn males, indicating that maternal adiponectin is involved in fetal fat deposition in a sex-specific manner. Large-scale epidemiological, longitudinal studies are necessary to confirm our results.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although prenatal and postnatal programming of metabolic diseases in adulthood is well established, the mechanisms underpinning metabolic programming are not. Dlk1, a key regulator of fetal development, inhibits adipocyte differentiation and restricts fetal growth. METHODS: Assess DLk1 expression in a Wistar rat model of catch-up growth following intrauterine restriction. Dams fed ad libitum delivered control pups (C) and dams on a 50% calorie-restricted diet delivered pups with low birth weight (R). Restricted offspring fed a standard rat chow showed catch-up growth (R/C) but those kept on a calorie-restricted diet did not (R/R). RESULTS: Decreased Dlk1 expression was observed in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle of R/C pups along with excessive visceral fat accumulation, decreased circulating adiponectin, increased triglycerides and HOMA-IR (from p < 0.05 to p < 0.0001). Moreover, in R/C pups the reduced Dlk1 expression in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle correlated with visceral fat (r = -0.820, p < 00001) and HOMA-IR (r = -0.745, p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Decreased Dlk1 expression relates to visceral fat expansion and insulin resistance in a rat model of catch-up growth following prenatal growth restriction. Modulation of Dlk1 expression could be among the targets for the early prevention of fetal programming of adult metabolic disorders.

AB  - The enzyme FASN (fatty acid synthase) is potentially related with hypertension and metabolic dysfunction. FASN is highly expressed in the human placenta. We aimed to investigate the relationship circulating FASN has with blood pressure, maternal metabolism and newborn parameters in healthy pregnant women. Circulating FASN was assessed in 115 asymptomatic pregnant women in the second trimester of gestation along with C-peptide, fasting glucose and insulin, post-load glucose lipids, HMW-adiponectin and blood pressure (the latter was assessed in each trimester of gestation). At birth, newborns and placentas were weighed. FASN expression was also able to be assessed in 80 placentas. Higher circulating FASN was associated with lower systolic blood pressure (SBP), with a more favourable metabolic phenotype (lower fasting glucose and insulin, post load glucose, HbAc1, HOMA-IR and C-peptide), and with lower placental and birth weight (all p < 0.05 to p < 0.001). Placental FASN expression related positively to circulating FASN (p < 0.005) and negatively to placental weight (p < 0.05). Our observations suggest a physiological role of placental FASN in human pregnancy. Future studies will clarify whether circulating FASN of placental origin does actually regulate placental and fetal growth, and (thereby) has a favourable influence on the pregnant mother's insulin sensitivity and blood pressure.

AB  - Context: Adiponectin is an adipocyte hormone involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. Recently, two receptors of this protein, called adiponectin receptor 1 (Adipo-R1) and Adipo-R2, have been cloned. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine whether adiponectin and its receptors are expressed in human and rat placentas and to evaluate the regulation of these factors by gestational age and nutritional status. Results: Our results demonstrate that adiponectin and Adipo-R2 are localized in both human and rat placentas. Human adiponectin and Adipo-R2 are presented in cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells. However, rat adiponectin and Adipo-R2 change their specific cell type immunostaining during gestation. Furthermore, placental adiponectin whereas Adipo-R2 has the contrary pattern. We also assessed the effect of food restriction ( 30%) during gestation, and we observed that adiponectin mRNA levels decrease after 16 d of undernutrition. In contrast, placental Adipo-R2 mRNA is unchanged by undernutrition. Finally, treatment with adiponectin during gestation decreases Adipo-R2, glucose transporter 3, lipoprotein lipase, and TGF-beta mRNA expression. Conclusion: Taken together, our results suggest that, at least in rodents, adiponectin may be involved in the regulation of several placental functions.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess cardiometabolic risk factors during normal pregnancy and the influence of maternal obesity on them. METHODS: This study included 25 healthy pregnant women with a single pregnancy and a gestational age of less than twenty weeks. Longitudinal analysis of blood pressure, body weight, body mass index (BMI), serum concentrations of leptin, adiponectin, cortisol, total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides, uric acid, fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test, HOMA-IR and insulin/glucose ratio was performed each trimester during pregnancy. In order to evaluate the impact of obesity, pregnant women were divided into two groups based on BMI for the first quarter of pregnancy: Gpn for pregnant women with BMI< 25 kg/m(2) and Gso for BMI= 25 kg/m(2). One-Way ANOVA for repeated measurements or Friedman test and Student-t or Mann-Whitney tests for statistical comparisons and Pearson correlations test were used for statistical analysis. RESULTS: The mean values for the first quarter of pregnancy for the following parameters were: age: 22 years; weight: 66.3 kg and BMI 26.4 kg/m(2), with 20.2 and 30.7 kg/m(2) for the Gpn and Gso groups, respectively. Mean weight gain during pregnancy was +/- 12.7 kg with 10.3 kg for the Gso group and 15.2 kg for the Gpn group. Regarding plasma determinations, cortisol, uric acid and lipid profile increased during all trimesters of pregnancy, except for HDL-cholesterol, which did not change. Blood pressure, insulin and HOMA-IR only increased in the third quarter of pregnancy. The Gso group tended to gain more weight and to show higher concentrations of leptin, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, VLDL-cholesterol, TG, glucose, insulin, HOMA-IR, besides lower HDL-cholesterol and greater diastolic blood pressure in the 3rd quarter of pregnancy. Three pregnant women developed gestational hypertension, presented prepregnancy obesity, excessive weight gain, hyperleptinemia and an insulin/glucose ratio greater than two. Weight and BMI were positively correlated with total cholesterol and its LDL fraction, TG, uric acid, fasting blood glucose, insulin and HOMA-IR; and were negatively correlated with adiponectin and HDL-cholesterol. Leptin level was positively correlated with blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: The metabolic changes in pregnancy are more significant in obese women, suggesting, as expected, an increased risk of cardiometabolic complications. During their first visit for prenatal care, obese women should be informed about these risks, have their BMI and insulin/glucose ratio calculated along with their lipid profile to identify pregnant women at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases.

AB  - To verify whether a diabetes family history might be a risk factor for the development, in adult age, of metabolic disorders, leptin, anthropometric and endocrine parameters were analysed in 95 babies with grandparents affected by type 2 diabetes (DF) and in 95 matched babies without diabetes family history (NDF). A sexual dimorphism for leptin was present in the NDF group (males: 6.7+/-4.1 ng/ml; females: 12.3+/-6.5; p < 0.0001) but not in the DF group (males: 9.0+/-5.5; females: 10.8+/-6.4), due to the significant increase in DF male leptin level, compared to that of NDF males (p < 0.05). In DF males only, leptin was positively correlated with body length, PI, C-peptide, IGF-1 and IGF1BP3. These results suggest that the increase in DF male leptin could be a compensatory mechanism for reduced insulin sensitivity in a pre-clinical alteration of glucose metabolism.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare serum maternal adiponectin concentrations in pregnant women with isolated intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR) and in pregnant women with IUGR concomitant with pre-eclampsia (IUGRcwPE)., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty patients with isolated IUGR (group 1), 20 patients with IUGRcwPE (group 2), and 30 healthy controls (group 3) between age 18-40 were included into the study. Venous blood samples of those patients were obtained in the starving state. Adiponectin concentrations were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in serum obtained after centrifugation. To find the differences between the groups, student t-test and one-way ANOVA statistical methods were used., RESULTS: There were no differences between the groups in terms of age, body mass index, gestational age, and parity (p>0.05). The values of amniotic fluid index (p<0.001) and weight gained during pregnancy (p=0.017) were significantly different when compared among the three groups. The mean concentrations of adiponectin were 94.041 pg/mL in the IUGR group, 55.717 pg/mL in the IUGRcwPE group, and 51.831 pg/mL in the control group. Both of the differences between the IUGR and IUGRcwPE groups (p value; <0.05) and IUGR and control groups were statistically significant (p value; <0.001). However, there were no significant differences between the IUGRcwPE group and control group (p>0.05)., CONCLUSION: We found that IUGR increased maternal serum adiponectin concentrations; however, this rise does not occur in pregnant women with IUGRcwPE.

AB  - CONTEXT: The phenotypic effects of ADIPOQ mutations early in life, prior to type 2 diabetes onset, have not been studied., AIM: The objective of the study was to characterize the impact of a novel ADIPOQ mutation in vitro and in vivo., DESIGN: The design of the study was ADIPOQ screening, adiponectin oligomerization, and cardiometabolic phenotype assessment., SUBJECTS: Fourteen hypoadiponectinemic (<3 mug/mL) and 686 normoadiponectinemic young adults (23-25 y) were prospectively followed up since birth., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Human and recombinant murine mutant adiponectin oligomerization, the proband's ADIPOQ and ADIPOR1/R2 adipose tissue (AT) expression, and cardiometabolic profile were measured., RESULTS: The heterozygous ADIPOQ p.M40K mutation was identified in one hypoadiponectinemic male (2.4 mug/mL) and three other family members. Carriers presented a marked reduction of serum high-molecular weight to total adiponectin ratio when compared with controls (9.4% +/- 1% vs 56.6% +/- 13%; P < .05) and family noncarriers (9.4% +/- 1% vs 42% +/- 0.5%; P = .05). Both mRNA and protein levels of adiponectin were increased in the AT of the proband (2.3- and 1.6-fold, respectively). However, the high-molecular weight to total adiponectin ratio of adiponectin was decreased (3.3-fold). Moreover, the expressions of ADIPOR1 and ADIPOR2 were significantly down-regulated in the AT of the proband (6- and 1.2-fold, respectively). The results were confirmed by in vitro studies on the recombinant murine homologous mutation (p.M43K). The proband's cardiometabolic phenotype progression was further characterized: born small for gestational age and adolescence-onset obesity; insulin resistance (homeostasis assessment model of insulin resistance of 4.7), and dyslipidemia at 25 years; decreased high-molecular weight adiponectin (0.24 mug/mL = 10%), hypertension (180/120 mm Hg), steatosis (fat liver = 40% +/- 6%), increased carotid intima-media thickness at 31 years, and type 2 diabetes (glycosylated hemoglobin = 6.6%) at 34 years of age. Of note, all of the affected family members presented features of metabolic syndrome., CONCLUSION: The newly identified ADIPOQ p.M40K mutation associates with severe cardiometabolic dysfunction due to the impairment of high-molecular weight adiponectin complex formation.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether the -11391G > A polymorphism in the regulatory region of the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) is associated with birth size, postnatal growth, adiponectinemia, and cardiometabolic risk in adult life. Design: Case-control study nested within a prospective cohort of 2063 community subjects born in 1978/1979 and followed since birth to date. Methods: ADIPOQ -11391G > A genotype-phenotype associations were evaluated in 116 subjects born large for gestational age (LGA) and 392 gender-matched controls at birth (birth size), at 8-10 years (catch-down growth), and at 23-25 years of age (cardiometabolic profile). Results: The -11391A variant allele frequency was higher in LGA subjects (P=0.04). AA genotype was associated with augmented probability of being born LGA (odds ratio=4.14; 95% confidence interval: 1.16-16.7; P=0.03). This polymorphism was associated neither with body composition nor with postnatal growth pattern. At the age of 23-25 years, the -11391A variant allele was associated with higher serum adiponectin levels (GG: 10.7 +/- 6.2 versus GA: 12.2 +/- 6.5 versus AA: 14.2 +/- 6.8 mu g/ml; P < 0.01). Subjects born LGA presented higher body mass index (BMI; P=0.01), abdominal circumference (P=0.04), blood pressure (P=0.04), and homeostasis assessment model for insulin resistance (P=0.01) than adequate for gestational age. Symmetry at birth did not influence these variables. The occurrence of catch-down of weight was associated with lower BMI and abdominal circumference (P < 0.001) at 23-25 years. Conclusions: The -11391A ADIPOQ gene variant was associated with increased chance of being born LGA and with higher adiponectin levels in early adult life.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To analyse the effect of zinc supplementation in growth and nutritional status of a homogeneous group of newborns with intra uterine growth retardation and asymmetric growth. The effect of changes of zinc status on growth and leptin serum concentrations was also analysed., POPULATION AND METHODS: A double blind, randomised clinical trial was designed in order to detect differences in growth between zinc and placebo groups during the first 6 months of life. 31 infants were included either to the zinc group (n = 14) (38.8+/-1.4 weeks GA, 2,171+/-253 g body weight) or the placebo group (n = 17) (38.9+/-1.1 weeks GA, 2,249+/-220 g body weight). The zinc group received a supplement of 3 mg elemental zinc per day (as zinc sulphate)., RESULTS: There were not significant differences between groups for anthropometric measurements through the study period. We found a significant effect of the study group, in hair zinc concentrations, but not in serum zinc concentrations; post-hoc comparisons for hair zinc revealed that there were significant differences between groups at 1, 2, and 6 months of age. Changes in serum and hair zinc concentrations from baseline to 6 months, showed significant correlations with changes in weight/age and length/age z-scores, in the supplement group. Changes in leptin serum concentrations during follow-up, showed significant correlations with changes in sum of 4 skinfolds and weight/age z-score, in the placebo group. Changes in hair zinc concentration through the study period showed significant correlations with changes in leptin serum concentrations from baseline to 6 months of follow-up., CONCLUSIONS: In a homogeneous group of intra uterine growth retardation infants with asymmetric growth, 3 mg/day zinc supplementation do not show significant improvements in weight and length growth. Changes in zinc status were related with changes in weight and length during the first 6 months of life. Changes in leptin serum concentrations were related with changes in the anthropometric indices of body fat accretion.

AB  - BACKGROUND: From the very beginning of life, biological events in the intrauterine environment influence the developing child, its growth, maturation and adaptation. The aim of this study was to assess the impact of maternal vitamin D and adiponectin status on offspring growth, general and bone health., METHODS: 162 healthy pregnant women were included in the study, with their vitaminD and adiponectin levels measured in the 32 nd week of pregnancy. Body weight and bone mineral density measurements of their offspring were performed at birth and at the age of three, six, nine and twelve months. Information on children's infectious, allergic and chronic disease was collected from their medical records., RESULTS: Vitamin D insufficiency/deficiency was present in 44% of pregnant women. There was no significant association between maternal vitamin D during pregnancy and offspring body weight at birth or later, as well as between maternal vitamin D and newborn bone mineral density. Additionally, there was no significant association between maternal vitamin D and infectious, allergic or other chronic diseases in offspring. A negative correlation between maternal adiponectin and offspring's body weight at birth was observed (r = - 0.37, p = 0.002), while association with bone mineral density in newborns was not significant., CONCLUSION: Despite the significant prevalence of vitamin D insufficiency among pregnant women, it did not influence growth or health of their offspring in this study. Maternal adiponectin levels showed an inverse relationship with birth weight of the infants, which may highlight the important link between maternal health and the offspring's growth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Adipocytokines are markers of fetal metabolism, but their association with childhood growth is unclear. This study examined associations of neonatal adipocytokines with longitudinal childhood adiposity measures in a prospective cohort of pregnant women and their children., METHODS: Leptin and adiponectin concentrations at delivery and children's BMI z scores between age 4 weeks and 8 years were measured. Differences in BMI z scores and rates of BMI z score change by leptin (n = 257) and adiponectin (n = 271) terciles were estimated., RESULTS: Children in the middle (mean difference: 0.2; 95% CI: -0.1 to 0.4) and highest (0.4; 95% CI: 0.1 to 0.6) leptin terciles had greater BMI z scores than children in the lowest tercile. Associations were null after adjustment for birth weight z score. Children in the lowest adiponectin tercile had greater gains in BMI z score (change per year: 0.10; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.13) than children in the middle (0.07; 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.09) and highest terciles (0.04; 95% CI: -0.01 to 0.05) (adiponectin x age interaction P < 0.001)., CONCLUSIONS: Lower adiponectin levels were associated with increased rates of BMI gains in the first 8 years of life. Though leptin was positively associated with BMI, this association may be confounded by birth weight. Copyright © 2019 The Obesity Society.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Gestational perfluoroalkyl substances exposure has been associated with decreased birthweight. We determined if gestational perfluoroalkyl substances exposure was associated with fetal metabolic markers using data from the HOME Study, a prospective birth cohort of pregnant women and their children in Cincinnati, Ohio., METHODS: Maternal serum concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid, and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid were quantified. We measured neonatal adipocytokine (leptin and adiponectin) concentrations in umbilical cord serum, and estimated percent differences with a 2-fold increase in maternal perfluoroalkyl substances concentrations among 230 mother-infant pairs., RESULTS: Median maternal serum PFOA and PFOS concentrations were 5.6 ng/mL and 14 ng/mL, respectively. Leptin was positively correlated with infant birthweight (p < 0.001). There were no statistically significant associations between maternal perfluoroalkyl substances and neonatal adipocytokine concentrations; each 2-fold increase in PFOA was associated with a non-significant increase in leptin (5%; 95% CI: -10, 22) and adiponectin (7%; 95% CI: -4, 19)., CONCLUSION: Despite known associations with reduced birthweight, gestational serum perfluoroalkyl substances concentrations were not associated with neonatal adipocytokine concentrations. Further exploration of pathways of perfluoroalkyl substances associated changes in birthweight may help identify biomarkers that could be used to identify at-risk populations and develop interventions.

AB  - AIM: To study cord blood concentrations of adiponectin and leptin in children born by normal weight, overweight and obese mothers and to study these parameters in relation to a weight gain intervention programme for obese mothers., METHODS: Ten millilitre cord blood was collected and analysed for leptin and adiponectin concentrations in children with gestational age >37 weeks born by 60 normal weight, 45 overweight and 145 obese mothers. 82 obese mothers took part in a weight gain intervention programme., RESULTS: Concentrations of leptin and adiponectin were higher in cord blood from children of overweight and obese mothers compared with children of normal weight mothers (leptin: Md 13.2, 30, 3 and 90.2 ng/mL respectively, p < 0.001; adiponectin 35.9, 205.4, 213.8 ng/L p < 0.001). No differences were found between overweight and obese mothers. The weight gain intervention programme for obese pregnant women had significant effects on the weight gain during pregnancy but had no effects on cord blood serum concentrations of leptin and adiponectin., CONCLUSION: Cord blood leptin and adiponectin concentrations were higher in children born by overweight or obese women compared with children of normal weight mothers. A weight gain intervention programme for obese pregnant women did not affect these results. Intrauterine exposition to high concentrations of leptin and adiponectin may play a role in weight development later in life. Copyright ©2013 Foundation Acta Paediatrica.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of reducing the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio in maternal nutrition on the maternal and cord blood leptin axis and their association with infant body composition up to 2 years., DESIGN AND METHODS: 208 healthy pregnant women were randomized to either a dietary intervention to reduce the n-6/n-3 fatty acid ratio from 15th week of gestation until 4 months postpartum or a control group. Leptin, soluble leptin receptor and free leptin index were determined in maternal and cord plasma and related to infant body composition assessed by skinfold thicknesses up to 2 years., RESULTS: The intervention had no effect on either the maternal or fetal leptin axis. Maternal leptin in late pregnancy was inversely related to infant weight and lean body mass (LBM) up to 2 years, after multiple adjustments. Cord leptin was positively related to weight, body fat, and LBM at birth, and inversely associated with weight, BMI, fat mass, and LBM at 2 years and weight gain up to 2 years. The contribution of cord leptin to infant outcomes was overall stronger compared with maternal leptin., CONCLUSIONS: Both, maternal and fetal leptin were associated with subsequent infant anthropometry with a greater impact of fetal leptin.

AB  - The physiological adaptations of the neonatal rat to hypoxia from birth include changes in gastrointestinal function and intermediary metabolism. We hypothesized that the hypoxic lactating dam would exhibit alterations in mammary gland function leading to changes in the concentration of milk peptides that are important in neonatal gastrointestinal development. The present study assessed the effects of chronic hypoxia on peptides produced by the mammary glands and present in milk. Chronic hypoxia decreased the concentration of epidermal growth factor (EGF) in expressed milk and pup stomach contents and decreased maternal mammary gland Egf mRNA. The concentration of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrp) was unchanged in milk and decreased in pup stomach contents: however, mammary Pthlh mRNA was increased by hypoxia. There was a significant increase in adiponectin concentrations in milk from hypoxic dams. Chronic hypoxia decreased maternal body weight, and pair feeding normoxic dams an amount of food equivalent to hypoxic dam food intake decreased body weight to an equivalent degree. Decreased food intake did not affect the expression of Egf, Pthlh, or Lep mRNA in mammary tissue. The results indicated that chronic hypoxia modulated mammary function independently of hypoxia-induced decreases in maternal food intake. Decreased EGF and increased adiponectin concentrations in milk from hypoxic dams likely affect the development of neonatal intestinal function.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Breastfeeding may protect children from developing metabolic syndrome and other diseases later in life. We investigated novel proteins in human breast milk that might play a role in this process., METHODS: We used ELISA to measure adiponectin, adipocyte and epidermal fatty acid binding proteins (AFABP, EFABP), and leptin concentrations in human breast milk obtained from 59 mothers 48 h after initiation of lactation. Using a questionnaire and medical records, we collected information about the mothers and newborns., RESULTS: Mean (SE) adiponectin concentrations in breast milk were 13.7 (0.8), range 3.9-30.4 microg/L; AFABP concentrations 26.7 (4.4), range 1.2-137.0 microg/L; EFABP concentrations 18.1 (1.4), range 0.8-47.0 microg/L; and leptin concentrations 0.50 (0.05), range 0-1.37 microg/L. We found a significant correlation between AFABP and EFABP concentrations (r = 0.593, P <0.0001). Maternal EFABP concentrations were significantly higher in mothers who delivered boys than in those who delivered girls [21.7 (2.3) vs 15.4 (1.7) microg/L, P = 0.028] and correlated with newborn birth weight (r = 0.266, P = 0.045). Maternal leptin correlated with body weight before pregnancy (r = 0.272, P = 0.043) and at delivery (r = 0.370, P = 0.005), body mass index before pregnancy (r = 0.397, P = 0.003) and at delivery (r = 0.498, P <0.0001), body weight gain during pregnancy (r = 0.267, P = 0.047), and newborn gestational age (r = 0.266, P = 0.048). Leptin was significantly lower in mothers who delivered preterm vs term babies [0.30 (0.09) vs 0.60 (0.05) ug/L, P = 0.026]., CONCLUSIONS: Concentrations of adiponectin, AFABP, and EFABP in human breast milk are related to nutritional variables of mothers and newborns and thus may play a role in the protective effects of breastfeeding.

AB  - Objective: Ectopic liver fat deposition, resulting from impaired subcutaneous adipose tissue expandability, may represent an age-dependent key feature linking low birth weight (LBW) with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We examined whether presumably healthy early middle-aged, non-obese LBW subjects exhibit increased liver fat content, whether increased liver fat in LBW is associated with the severity of dysmetabolic traits and finally whether such associations may be confounded by genetic factors., Methods: Using 1H magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we measured hepatic fat content in 26 early middle-aged, non-obese LBW and 22 BMI-matched normal birth weight (NBW) males. Endogenous glucose production was measured by stable isotopes, and a range of plasma adipokine and gut hormone analytes were measured by multiplex ELISA. Genetic risk scores were calculated from genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for birth weight, height, T2D, plasma cholesterol and risk genotypes for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)., Results: The LBW subjects had significantly increased hepatic fat content compared with NBW controls (P= 0.014), and 20% of LBW vs no controls had overt NAFLD. LBW subjects with NAFLD displayed widespread metabolic changes compared with NBW and LBW individuals without NAFLD, including hepatic insulin resistance, plasma adipokine and gut hormone perturbations as well as dyslipidemia. As an exception, plasma adiponectin levels were lower in LBW subjects both with and without NAFLD as compared to NBW controls. Genetic risk for selected differential traits did not differ between groups., Conclusion: Increased liver fat content including overt NAFLD may be on the critical path linking LBW with increased risk of developing T2D in a non-genetic manner.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Sleep disturbances and alterations of diurnal endocrine rhythms are associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D). We previously showed that young men born small for gestational age (SGA) and with increased risk of T2D have elevated fat and decreased glucose oxidation rates during nighttime. In this study, we investigated whether SGA men have an altered diurnal profile of hormones, substrates and inflammatory markers implicated in T2D pathophysiology compared with matched individuals born appropriate for gestational age (AGA)., METHODS: We collected hourly blood samples for 24 h, to measure levels of glucose, free fatty acids (FFA), triglycerides (TG), insulin, C-peptide, leptin, resistin, ghrelin, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), incretins (GLP-1 and GIP), and inflammatory markers (TNF-alpha and IL-6) in 13 young men born SGA and 11 young men born AGA., RESULTS: Repeated measurements analyses were used to analyze the diurnal variations and differences between groups. The SGA subjects had increased 24-h glucose (P=0.03), glucagon (P=0.03) and resistin (P=0.003) levels with no difference in diurnal rhythms compared with AGA controls. We found significant diurnal variations in levels of blood glucose, plasma TG, FFA, insulin, C-peptide, GLP-1, GIP, leptin, visfatin, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and PAI-1. The variation in FFA levels differed between the groups during the evening. Plasma ghrelin and glucagon levels did not display diurnal variations., CONCLUSIONS: Young men born SGA exhibit elevated 24-h blood glucose, and plasma glucagon and resistin levels with no major differences in diurnal rhythms of these or other key metabolic hormones, substrates or inflammatory markers implicated in the origin of adiposity and T2D.

AB  - Low birth weight (LBW) is associated with an increased risk of insulin resistance and downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes when exposed to a metabolic challenge of high-fat overfeeding (HFO). To elaborate further on the differential effects of HFO in LBW subjects, we measured in vivo mitochondrial function, insulin secretion, hepatic glucose production, and plasma levels of key regulatory hormones before and after 5 days of HFO in 20 young LBW and 26 normal-birth-weight (NBW) men. The LBW subjects developed peripheral insulin resistance after HFO due to impaired endogenous glucose storage (9.42 +/- 4.19 vs. 5.91 +/- 4.42 mg.kg FFM(-1). min(-1), P = 0.01). Resting muscle phosphorcreatine and total ATP in muscle increased significantly after HFO in LBW subjects only, whereas additional measurements of mitochondrial function remained unaffected. Despite similar plasma FFA levels, LBW subjects displayed increased fat oxidation during insulin infusion compared with normal-birth-weight (NBW) subjects after HFO (0.37 +/- 0.35 vs. 0.17 +/- 0.33 mg.kg FFM(-1). min(-1), P = 0.02). In contrast to NBW subjects, the plasma leptin levels of LBW subjects did not increase, and the plasma gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) as well as pancreatic polypeptide (PP) levels increased less in LBW compared with NBW subjects during HFO. In conclusion, HFO unmasks dissociation between insulin resistance and mitochondrial dysfunction in LBW subjects, suggesting that insulin resistance may be a cause, rather than an effect, of impaired muscle OXPHOS gene expression and mitochondrial dysfunction. Reduced increments in response to HFO of fasting plasma leptin, PP, and GIP levels may contribute to insulin resistance, lower satiety, and impaired insulin secretion in LBW subjects.

AB  - AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Low birthweight (LBW) is associated with dysfunctions of adipose tissue and metabolic disease in adult life. We hypothesised that altered epigenetic and transcriptional regulation of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) could play a role in programming adipose tissue dysfunction in LBW individuals., METHODS: ADSCs were isolated from the subcutaneous adipose tissue of 13 normal birthweight (NBW) and 13 LBW adult men. The adipocytes were cultured in vitro, and genome-wide differences in RNA expression and DNA methylation profiles were analysed in ADSCs and differentiated adipocytes., RESULTS: We demonstrated that ADSCs from LBW individuals exhibit multiple expression changes as well as genome-wide alterations in methylation pattern. Reduced expression of the transcription factor cyclin T2 encoded by CCNT2 may play a key role in orchestrating several of the gene expression changes in ADSCs from LBW individuals. Indeed, silencing of CCNT2 in human adipocytes decreased leptin secretion as well as the mRNA expression of several genes involved in adipogenesis, including MGLL, LIPE, PPARG, LEP and ADIPOQ. Only subtle genome-wide mRNA expression and DNA methylation changes were seen in mature cultured adipocytes from LBW individuals., CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Epigenetic and transcriptional changes in LBW individuals are most pronounced in immature ADSCs that in turn may programme physiological characteristics of the mature adipocytes that influence the risk of metabolic diseases. Reduced expression of CCNT2 may play a key role in the developmental programming of adipose tissue.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Preterm very-low-birth-weight (<=1500 g) infants exhibit disproportionate weight-for-length growth in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit., LOCAL PROBLEM: High frequency of body mass index (BMI) > 90th centile at discharge and 1-year postnatal age associated with elevated blood pressure and serum leptin in infancy and adolescence., METHODS: Single-institution quality improvement project in appropriately grown infants born at 230/7-286/7 weeks gestational age and discharged home., INTERVENTION: Adjustable feeding protocol based on valid serial length measurements (board or caliper)., RESULTS: The average monthly percentage of weight-for-length disproportion at discharge decreased from 13% in Epoch 1 to 0% in Epoch 2 (P < 0.05). Although the average Z-score for BMI at discharge was lower in Epoch 2 versus Epoch 1 (P < 0.01), this was absent by 1 year follow-up (P = 0.91)., CONCLUSIONS: Adjustable feedings plus use of accurate serial length measurements decreases weight-for-length disproportion at hospital discharge but not at 1 year.

AB  - Emerging research has highlighted the importance of leptin in fetal growth and development independent of its essential role in the maintenance of hunger and satiety through the modulation of neuropeptide Y and proopiomelanocortin neurons. Alterations in maternal-placental-fetal leptin exchange may modify the development of the fetus and contribute to the increased risk of developing disease in adulthood. In addition, leptin also plays an important role in reproductive functions, with plasma leptin concentrations rising in pregnant women, peaking during the third trimester. Elevated plasma leptin concentrations occur at the completion of organogenesis, and research in animal models has demonstrated that leptin is involved in the development and maturation of a number of organs, including the heart, brain, kidneys, and pancreas. Elevated maternal plasma leptin is associated with maternal obesity, and reduced fetal plasma leptin is correlated with intrauterine growth restriction. Alterations in plasma leptin during development may be associated with an increased risk of developing a number of adulthood diseases, including cardiovascular, metabolic, and renal diseases via altered fetal development and organogenesis. Importantly, research has shown that leptin antagonism after birth significantly reduces maturation of numerous organs. Conversely, restoration of the leptin deficiency after birth in growth-restricted animals restores the offspring's body weight and improves organogenesis. Therefore, leptin appears to play a major role in organogenesis, which may adversely affect the risk of developing a number of diseases in adulthood. Therefore, greater understanding of the role of leptin during development may assist in the prevention and treatment of a number of disease states that occur in adulthood.

AB  - "Prenatal/fetal programming," implying structural/functional disorders of developing tissues/organs, consequent to an adverse intrauterine environment leading to asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), predisposes to metabolic syndrome and noncommunicable diseases in adulthood, in the framework of the "Developmental Origins of Health and Disease" (DOHaD) concept. DOHaD consequences are associated with adipose tissue, particularly the visceral one, occurring in relative abundance in IUGR infants. Adipose tissue secretes numerous hormones, collectively called adipocytokines, as leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, resistin, apelin, visfatin, omentin, vaspin, preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1), fatty acid-binding protein-4, lipocalin-2, and others, implicated in fetal growth, body metabolism, energy homeostasis, and insulin resistance. Early identification of adipocytokines as biomarkers predicting later metabolic disorders/diseases in IUGR individuals, enabling relevant protective interventions, would be of utmost importance. Current data do not support this perspective, due to controversial results in the literature, with the eventual exception of visfatin and possibly Pref-1.

AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: To study the concentrations of preadipocyte factor-1 (Pref-1) -an inhibitor of adipocyte differentiation, implicated in adipose tissue metabolism, late metabolic disorders and fetal growth- in maternal and umbilical cord serum, as well as maternal milk and correlate above concentrations with intrauterine growth and other perinatal parameters., MATERIAL AND METHODS: Pref-1 concentrations were determined by ELISA in antepartum maternal and umbilical cord serum, as well as day 3 to 4 postpartum breast milk, deriving from 80 women, who delivered 40 appropriate (AGA), 20 large for gestational age (LGA) and 20 intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) neonates, classified by the use of customized birth-weight standards adjusted for significant determinants of fetal growth., RESULTS: Umbilical cord serum Pref-1 concentrations were significantly higher than antepartum maternal ones (p<0.001), while breast milk concentrations were the lowest (p<0.001 concerning umbilical serum, p<0.001 concerning maternal serum). Umbilical cord serum Pref-1 concentrations were significantly lower in the LGA group than in the AGA one (p=0.044). Breast milk and maternal serum Pref-1 concentrations did not differ between the three intrauterine growth groups. Maternal serum and breast milk Pref-1 concentrations did not correlate with maternal age, body mass index before and after gestation, birth weight, body length, and customized centile. A positive weak correlation was recorded between maternal serum and milk Pref-1 concentrations (r=0.238, p=0.034)., CONCLUSIONS: Pref-1 concentrations in umbilical cord serum are higher than in antepartum maternal serum, probably pointing to its fetal origin and role in intrauterine growth. Breast milk concentrations, being extremely low, and possibly implying infant protection from metabolic disorders, positively correlate with maternal serum ones, conceivably suggesting a transfer of the substance from the circulation to the breast. Umbilical cord serum Pref-1 concentrations were lower in LGA fetuses/neonates, as compared to respective AGA ones. Copyright © 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To prospectively investigate the potential associations of the novel adipocytokines resistin, apelin and visfatin (recently implicated in bone metabolism) with bone biomarkers in fetal and neonatal blood from intra uterine growth restricted (IUGR, associated with low bone mass at birth) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies., METHODS: Circulating concentrations of resistin, apelin and visfatin were correlated with concentrations of markers of bone formation [osteocalcin (OC), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BALP)] and resorption [osteoprotegerin (OPG), soluble receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (sRANKL) and cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx)] in 20 IUGR and 20 AGA full-term fetuses and neonates on postnatal day 1-(N1) and 4-(N4)., RESULTS: In the AGA group, fetal resistin and N1 visfatin concentrations negatively correlated with respective NTx ones (r >= -0.472, p <= 0.036 in both cases). In the IUGR group, fetal and N4 resistin concentrations negatively correlated with sRANKL concentrations (r >= -0.583, p <= 0.007 in both cases). Furthermore, fetal apelin and visfatin concentrations positively correlated with fetal BALP ones (r >= 0.471, p <= 0.042, in both cases)., CONCLUSIONS: All three adipocytokines may exert a positive effect on fetal/neonatal bone metabolism, either by inhibiting bone resorption or promoting bone formation in both normal and IUGR pregnancies. Although the mechanisms behind these correlations are unclear, a modulation of perinatal bone metabolism by these adipocytokines may be suggested.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate circulating concentrations of omentin-1 and vaspin (adipocytokines predominantly secreted by visceral adipose tissue and not yet investigated in perinatal life) in maternal, fetal, and neonatal samples from intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR; associated with altered development of adipose tissue) and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) pregnancies and to correlate them with the respective insulin concentrations. Serum omentin-1 and vaspin concentrations were determined by enzyme immunoassay in 40 mothers and their 20 IUGR and 20 AGA singleton full-term fetuses and neonates on postnatal day 1 (N1) and day 4 (N4). Both hormones were detectable in fetal and neonatal blood (omentin-1 [mean +/- SD, in nanograms per milliliter]: AGA vs IUGR group--fetal: 11.32 +/- 1.88 vs 10.47 +/- 1.30, N1: 10.74 +/- 1.42 vs 10.46 +/- 1.54, and N4: 10.90 +/- 2.72 vs 11.35 +/- 3.92; vaspin [median, minimum-maximum; in nanograms per milliliter]: AGA vs IUGR group--fetal: 0.39 [0.04-19.06] vs 0.40 [0.05-1.34], N1: 0.40 [0.04-16.70] vs 0.44 [0.23-3.34], and N4: 0.49 [0.02-8.89] vs 0.55 [0.06-3.92]). No significant differences in omentin-1 or vaspin concentrations were observed between IUGR and AGA groups, whereas fetal and N1 insulin concentrations were lower in the former (P = .025 and P = .027, respectively). In both groups, fetal omentin-1 concentrations were higher (P <= .018), whereas vaspin concentrations were lower (P <= .001), than maternal ones. Furthermore, maternal vaspin concentrations were higher in cases of cesarean delivery (P = .024). Omentin-1 and vaspin concentrations did not correlate with the respective insulin ones. In conclusion, omentin-1 and vaspin are present in the fetus and neonate. Perinatal concentrations of omentin-1 and vaspin are similar in IUGR cases and AGA controls--despite lower insulin concentrations in the former--and do not correlate with the respective insulin concentrations. Higher omentin-1 concentrations in the fetus may be crucial to enhance a growth-promoting effect, whereas lower maternal vaspin concentrations in cases of vaginal delivery may be attributed to spontaneous term delivery inflammation.

AB  - Cumulative evidence suggests that the origins of obesity may occur during fetal development. In this respect, the concept of "developmental programming" was introduced and supported by experimental and epidemiological data. This concept supports the idea that the nutritional and hormonal status during pregnancy could irreversibly interfere in metabolism control. The mechanisms responsible for this developmental programming remain poorly documented. However, recent research indicates that adipocytokines may play a critical role in this process. Thus, leptin, adiponectin, and the recently identified resistin, visfatin, and apelin, all exert effects on fat, muscle, and liver cells early in life. The aforementioned adipocytokines are secreted by adipocytes and human placenta during fetal life and may play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of the metabolic syndrome. This review will focus on the intrauterine expression of adipocytokines, their contribution to the hormonal control of fetal growth, and their role in restricted and exaggerated intrauterine growth.

AB  - Human pregnancy is characterized by insulin resistance, traditionally attributed to the effects of placental hormones. Normal pregnancy-induced insulin resistance is further enhanced in pregnancy complications, associated with disturbed placental function, such as gestational diabetes mellitus, preeclampsia, and intrauterine growth restriction. Compelling evidence suggests that these pregnancy disorders are associated with future development of maternal metabolic syndrome. However, the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the association between abnormal placental development, insulin resistance, and maternal metabolic syndrome are not fully understood. A large body of evidence has recently supported the role of adipose tissue in the regulation of insulin resistance in both nonpregnant and pregnant participants. In this respect, adipocytokines, which are adipocyte-derived hormones, have been implicated in the regulation of maternal metabolism and gestational insulin resistance. Adipocytokines, including leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha, interleukin 6, as well as the newly discovered resistin, visfatin, and apelin, are also known to be produced within the intrauterine environment. However, data concerning the pattern of adipocytokines secretion in normal and complicated pregnancies are still limited and partially contradictory. Given the importance of adipose tissue and its hormones in terms of adequate metabolic control and energy homeostasis, we present a review of published data related to the role of adipocytokines in pregnancy, especially in relation to pregnancy complications. Focus will be placed on the functions and other potential roles of the novel adipocytokines resistin, visfatin, and apelin.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is the failure of the fetus to achieve his/her intrinsic growth potential, due to anatomical and/or functional disorders and diseases in the feto-placental-maternal unit. IUGR results in significant perinatal and long-term complications, including the development of insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome in adulthood. The thrifty phenotype hypothesis holds that intrauterine malnutrition leads to an adaptive response that alters the fetal metabolic and hormonal milieu designed for intrauterine survival. This fetal programming predisposes to an increased susceptibility for chronic diseases. Although the mechanisms controlling intrauterine growth are poorly understood, adipose tissue may play an important role in linking poor fetal growth to the subsequent development of adult diseases. Adipose tissue secretes a number of hormones, called adipocytokines, important in modulating metabolism and recently involved in intrauterine growth. This review aims to summarize reported findings concerning the role of adipocytokines (leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL6), visfatin, resistin, apelin) in early life, while attempting to speculate mechanisms through which differential regulation of adipocytokines in IUGR may influence the risk for development of chronic diseases in later life.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The adipocytokine resistin inhibits adipogenesis and induces insulin resistance. Intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) neonates have reduced fat mass and changes of endocrine/metabolic mechanisms, predisposing to insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome in adult life., OBJECTIVES: To investigate plasma resistin concentrations in maternal, fetal and neonatal samples from IUGR and appropriate-for-gestational-age (AGA) pregnancies and correlate them with respective insulin concentrations., METHODS: Plasma resistin and insulin concentrations were determined in 40 mothers and their 20 IUGR and 20 AGA singleton full-term fetuses and neonates on postnatal day 1 (N1) and day 4 (N4)., RESULTS: No significant differences in resistin concentrations were observed between AGA and IUGR groups. In the AGA group, maternal resistin concentrations were significantly lower compared to fetal, N1 and N4 ones (p = 0.003, p = 0.017 and p = 0.039, respectively). Maternal resistin concentrations positively correlated with fetal ones (r = 0.527, p = 0.02). In the IUGR group, maternal resistin concentrations were significantly lower compared to N1 (p < 0.001) and positively correlated with N4 concentrations (r = 0.626, p = 0.007). In both groups, the effect of gender, mode of delivery, parity and adjusted birth weight (customized centiles) on resistin concentrations was not significant. No correlation between resistin and insulin concentrations was documented., CONCLUSIONS: Lack of difference in resistin concentrations between IUGR and AGA groups, and lack of correlation between resistin and insulin concentrations as well as customized centiles, possibly suggests that resistin may not be directly involved in the regulation of insulin sensitivity and adipogenesis in the perinatal period. Mode of delivery and parity are not associated with circulating resistin concentrations. Copyright (c) 2007 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: IGF-I and insulin are the main regulators of intrauterine and postnatal growth. Adipose tissue secreted cytokines are implicated in intrauterine growth. The relevant function of the adipocytokine visfatin is unknown., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum visfatin, IGF-I and insulin levels were measured by enzyme immunoassays in 40 singleton full-term fetuses and neonates on postnatal days 1(N1) and 4 (N4)., RESULTS: No significant correlations exist between visfatin and IGF-I or insulin. N1 and N4 visfatin positively correlated with customized (adjusted) birth weight centiles (r=0.511, P=0.021, and r=0.597, P=0.005, respectively). Fetal and N1 IGF-I positively correlated with customized centiles (r=0.608, P<0.001 and r=0.485, P=0.006, respectively). Fetal insulin positively correlated with customized centiles (r=0.654, P=0.021)., CONCLUSIONS: Potential implication of visfatin in fetal growth is probably not mediated by IGF-I or insulin. Although a more active role cannot be excluded, visfatin may simply represent a marker of fat accumulation.

AB  - Background: The identification of genetic, early childhood and lifestyle factors related to cardiometabolic risk factors in childhood is important for the development of preventive strategies against cardiovascular diseases. Intrafamilial associations of cardiometabolic risk factors are rarely studied and the few existing results are inconsistent. Aims: To study the relationship of cardiometabolic risk factors in parent-offspring pairs (trios) of the prospective Ulm Birth Cohort Study (UBCS). Methods: At the 8-yr follow-up examination of the UBCS weights, heights, waist circumferences (WC), systolic (sysBP) and diastolic blood pressure (diasBP) of n = 304 8 yrs old children and their parents were measured. Fasting plasma samples were collected and concentrations of insulin, glucose, retinol-binding-protein 4 (RBP4), adiponectin, leptin, apolipoprotein A and B (ApoA, ApoB) were analyzed. Results: BMI values and WC were stronger related in father-offspring than in mother-offspring pairs. Adjustment for potential confounders did not change these results. Fasting plasma concentrations of insulin, glucose, RBP4, ApoB, sysBP and diastBP were stronger correlated in mother-offspring than in father-offspring pairs also after adjusting for potential confounders. Offsprings of fathers that have >= 3 cardiometabolic risk factors had 0.74 kg/m(2) higher BMI values and 2.34 cm higher WC compared to offsprings of the reference group (both parents having <3 cardiometabolic risk factors). There was a trend for higher fasting plasma insulin concentrations in offsprings where the mother had >= 3 cardiometabolic risk factors compared to offsprings of the reference group. Conclusion: These results might be explained by gender-specific genetic factors as well as by early life programming. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Omentin, a newly identified adipokine, enhances insulin mediated glucose uptake in human adipocytes, thus, inducing systemic insulin-sensitizing effect. The aims of this study were to determine whether circulating maternal omentin levels are associated with insulin resistance indices and to assess which compartment, maternal, fetal, or placental, is the source of omentin in maternal circulation., METHODS: Fasting serum glucose, insulin, and omentin were determined in 25 healthy pregnant women at the third trimester, before and 3 days after elective cesarean section. Cord blood omentin was measured in the 25 term neonates. Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) was used to evaluate insulin sensitivity before and after delivery., RESULTS: Antepartum maternal omentin levels were negatively correlated with insulin levels (r=-0.41, P=0.04) and positively correlated with insulin sensitivity (HOMA%S; r=0.4, P=0.04). Postpartum omentin levels were negatively correlated with maternal body mass index (r=-0.44, P=0.02). Median maternal omentin levels was comparable before and after delivery (57.2, inter-quartile range: 38.2-76.2 ng/mL vs. 53.4, 39.8-69.4 ng/mL, respectively, P=0.25) and highly correlated (r=0.83, P<0.001). Antepartum maternal and neonatal omentin levels did not differ significantly (fetal: 62.2, 44.3-74.2 ng/mL, P=0.77) and did not correlate (P=0.6)., CONCLUSIONS: Circulating maternal omentin levels are correlated with insulin resistance indices, suggesting that this adipokine may play a role in metabolic adaptations of normal gestation. The strong correlation between anteparum and postpartum maternal omentin levels, as well as the lack of association between maternal and neonatal omentin levels, suggest that placental or fetal compartments are unlikely as the main source of circulating maternal omentin.

AB  - Background: Adverse intrauterine environment-reflected by low birth weight (LBW)-has been linked to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes later in life. Whether beta-cell function reduction and insulin resistance could be detected even in middle-aged adults without overt diabetes is less investigated. We examined the association of LBW with beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity in non-diabetic middle-aged adults from the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil)., Methods: This is a cross-sectional analysis of 2,634 ELSA-Brasil participants aged between 34 and 59 years, without diabetes. Participants were stratified according to LBW defined as <2.5 kg and their clinical data were compared. HOMA-IR, HOMA-beta, HOMA-adiponectin, TyG index, QUICKI and TG/HDL were calculated and their association with LBW were tested using multiple linear regression including adjustments suggested by Directed Acyclic Graphs and propensity score matching was applied., Results: The sample (47.4 +/- 6.3 years) was composed of 57.5% of women and 9% had LBW. Subjects with LBW and normal-weight reported similar BMI values at the age of 20 years and current BMI was slightly lower in the LBW group. In average, cardiometabolic risk profile and also indexes of beta-cell function and insulin sensitivity were within normal ranges. In regression analysis, log-transformed HOMA-beta-but not with the other indexes-was associated with LBW (p = 0.014) independent of sex, skin color, prematurity, and family history of diabetes. After applying propensity-score matching in a well-balanced sample, HOMA-AD and TG/HDL indexes were associated with LBW., Conclusion: The association between LBW and insulin sensitivity markers may occur in healthy middle-aged adults before overt glucose metabolism disturbances. Our data are coherent with the detection of early life events consequent with insulin resistance markers that could contribute to the risk of glucose metabolism disturbances.

AB  - Introduction: Low birth weight (LBW) is considered indicative of adverse in utero conditions during critical period of development. Epigenetic changes in the fetus have been associated with increased risk of some chronic diseases in adulthood. Associations of LBW with reduced beta cell and kidney functions in the Brazilian population were less investigated. We examined the association of birth weight in a large sample of non-diabetic adults from the ELSA-Brasil. Method(s): A cross-sectional analysis of 819 non-diabetic ELSA-Brasil participants who had birth weight self-reported was performed. LBW (< 2.5 kg) was analyzed as a categorical variable; characteristics of LBW neonates were compared with normal birth weight ones (NBW >= 2.5 kg). In models of linear and logistic regression analysis, associations of LBW with parameters of beta cell function and insulin resistance (fasting glucose, A1c, HOMA-b, HOMA-IR, HOMA-adiponectin, TyG and QUICKI index), blood pressure (BP) and kidney function (albumin/creatinine ratio-ACR, glomerular filtration rate and serum cystatin C) were assessed. Variables were log-transformed for analyses. Result(s): Mean age was 45.5 +/- 4.8yrs and did not differ between NBW and LBW groups. The LBW had higher BP and ACR than the NBW group. After adjustments for age, sex and body mass index LBW was significantly associated with higher systolic BP levels or with the presence of hypertension (OR 0.77, 95%CI 1.05-4.25), and with ACR adjusted for age, sex, body mass index and blood pressure (p = 0.03). No significant association between LBW and parameters of beta cell function or insulin resistance was found. Conclusion(s): Associations detected in our study reinforced the hypothesis that LBW could increase the risk of hypertension and kidney dysfunction later in life. However, our findings regarding beta cell function and insulin sensitivity were unable to support similar impact on the risk of glucose disturbances. We suggest that more accurate parameters should be explored to deepen such investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The control of growth and nutritional status in the foetus and neonate is a complex mechanism, in which also hormones produced by adipose tissue, such as adiponectin and leptin are involved. The aim of this study was to evaluate levels of adiponectin, leptin and insulin in appropriate (AGA) and small for gestational age (SGA) children during the 1st year of life and to correlate these with auxological parameters., METHODS: In 33 AGA and 29 SGA infants, weight, length, head circumference, glucose, insulin, adiponectin and leptin levels were evaluated at the second day of life, and at one, six and twelve months, during which a portion of SGA could show catch-up growth (rapid growth in infants born small for their gestational age)., RESULTS: Both total and isoform adiponectin levels were comparable between AGA and SGA infants at birth and until age one year. These levels significantly increased from birth to the first month of life and then decreased to lower values at 1 year of age in all subjects. Circulating leptin concentrations were higher in AGA (2.1 +/- 4.1 ng/ml) than in SGA neonates (0.88 +/- 1.03 ng/ml, p < 0.05) at birth, then similar at the 1st and the 6th month of age, but they increased in SGA from six months to one year, when they showed catch-up growth. Circulating insulin levels were not statistically different in AGA and SGA neonates at any study time point. Insulin levels in both AGA and SGA infants increased over the study period, and were significantly lower at birth compared to one, six and 12 months of age., CONCLUSIONS: During the first year of life, in both AGA and SGA infants a progressive decrease in adiponectin levels was observed, while a difference in leptin values was correlated with the nutritional status.

AB  - Low levels of serum adiponectin (i.e. hypoadiponectinaemia) are a marker of cardiometabolic risk in overweight children. It is not clear whether early-life factors may play a role in the development of hypoadiponectinaemia. We investigated whether antenatal factors and postnatal growth are associated with childhood adiponectin levels. This was an observational study in a birth cohort (Vulnerable Windows Cohort Study). Anthropometry was measured at birth, at 6 weeks, every 3 months up to 2 years and then every 6 months. Fasting glucose, insulin, lipids and adiponectin were measured at a mean age 11.5 years. Data on 323 children were analysed with age-and sex-adjusted multivariate analyses. The sizes of mother, placenta, fetus and newborn were not significantly associated with adiponectin levels. Current weight, body mass index (BMI), fat mass, waist circumference, glucose, insulin resistance [homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR)], triglycerides and systolic blood pressure were inversely related to adiponectin (P < 0.05). Faster growth in BMI during late infancy and childhood was associated with lower adiponectin levels (P < 0.05). After adjusting for current waist circumference, faster growth in BMI during early infancy was positively associated with adiponectin (P < 0.01). Faster growth in BMI during childhood was inversely associated (P < 0.001). These associations were similar after adjusting for HOMA-IR. We concluded that antenatal factors are not determinants of childhood adiponectin levels. Faster growth in BMI during infancy is associated with higher levels, whereas faster rates during childhood are associated with hypoadiponectinaemia. Hypoadiponectinaemia is a marker of a more adverse cardiometabolic profile in Afro-Caribbean children.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible alterations in cord blood levels of adipokines, chemerin and obestatin (secreted by adipose tissue and associated with later development of insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome), as well as insulin, in large for gestational age (LGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies, granted that these groups differ in body fat mass and metabolic/endocrine mechanisms., METHODS: Cord blood chemerin, obestatin, and insulin concentrations were prospectively measured in 40 LGA (9 born from diabetic and 31 from nondiabetic mothers) and 40 AGA singleton full-term infants., RESULTS: Cord blood chemerin concentrations were significantly higher in LGA compared with AGA neonates (b = 38.91, SE 9.29, p < 0.001). In contrast, no significant differences in obestatin concentrations were observed between groups. Insulin levels were significantly elevated as customized centiles increased (b = 0.003, SE = 0.001, p = 0.032)., CONCLUSIONS: Higher chemerin concentrations in LGA neonates possibly reflect the increased adipose tissue in this group. Lack of difference between the two groups in circulating levels of obestatin-possibly a sensitive marker of insulin resistance-might be due to development of metabolic disorders later in life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate possible alterations in cord blood levels of adipokine nesfatin-1 (secreted by adipose tissue and pancreatic beta-cells and implicated in glucose metabolism and insulin resistance), as well as insulin, in large (LGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) pregnancies, granted that these groups differ in body fat mass and metabolic/endocrine mechanisms., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cord blood nesfatin-1 and insulin concentrations were prospectively measured in 40 LGA (9 born from diabetic and 31 from non-diabetic mothers) and 20 AGA singleton full-term infants as well as their mothers., RESULTS: Cord blood nesfatin-1 concentrations were significantly lower in LGA compared to AGA neonates (b=-0.206, SE 0.07, p=0.005). However, cord blood nesfatin-1 concentrations were elevated in infants born from mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), compared to those born from non-diabetic mothers, after controlling for group (b=0.190, SE 0.10, p=0.05). Finally, cord blood nesfatin-1 concentrations were lower in cases of vaginal delivery (b=0.11, SE 0.05, p=0.042). Insulin levels were significantly elevated, as customized centiles increased (b=0.004, SE=0.002, p=0.016). No significant correlation was found between insulin and nesfatin-1 in maternal and umbilical cord levels., CONCLUSIONS: In this study nesfatin-1 levels are decreased in LGA compared to AGA fetuses. Fetal nesfatin-1 concentrations are higher in cases of GDM and cord blood nesfatin-1 concentrations are lower in cases of vaginal delivery. Copyright © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Secular changes in pubertal timing and particular forms of sexual precocity after migration to new geographical areas whose levels of environment differ from those in the natal country suggest that endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) may be involved. Studies in humans based on measurement of some EDC in relation to pubertal timing are inconclusive for several possible reasons including predominant genetic determinism and effects of complex EDC mixtures. Based on animal models, some possible neuroendocrine mechanisms are discussed as well as the interrelation between the homeostasis of reproduction and energy balance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low birth weight (LBW), no early catch-up weight, and subsequent fat accumulation have been associated with increased risks of insulin resistance from childhood onward and later cardiovascular disease. We sought to clarify the effects of high birth weight (HBW) and postnatal weight gain on insulin resistance., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 117 obese children aged 10.4 +/- 2.4 years were divided into three groups according to fetal growth after exclusion of maternal diabetes. They were comparable for age, sex, puberty, and percent body fat. Customized French birth weight standards, adjusted for maternal characteristics and gestation number, identified subjects with true altered fetal growth: 32 had increased fetal growth according to customized standards (HBWcust), 52 were eutrophic, and 33 had restricted fetal growth according to customized standards (LBWcust). Fat distribution by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, insulin sensitivity indexes from an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), and leptin, adiponectin, and visfatin levels were compared between groups., RESULTS: The HBWcust subjects had a higher adiponectin level, higher whole-body insulin sensitivity index (WBISI), and lower hepatic insulin resistance index, lower insulin and free fatty acid concentrations during OGTT, and lower trunk fat percent than eutrophic (P < 0.05) and LBWcust subjects (P < 0.05). Besides birth weight, weight gain between 0 and 2 years was a positive predictor (P < 0.05) of WBISI, whereas weight gain after 4 years was a negative predictor (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: HBW and early weight gain may program insulin sensitivity and adipose tissue metabolism and contribute to so-called metabolically healthy obesity.

AB  - Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic profile changes occurring during fetal development in response to in utero environment variations could be one of the mechanisms involved in the early determinants of adult chronic diseases. In this study, we tested whether maternal glycemic status is associated with the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) DNA methylation profile in placenta tissue, in maternal circulating blood cells, and in cord blood cells. We found that lower DNA methylation levels in the promoter of ADIPOQ on the fetal side of the placenta were correlated with higher maternal glucose levels during the second trimester of pregnancy (2-h glucose after the oral glucose tolerance test; r(s) <= -0.21, P < 0.05). Lower DNA methylation levels on the maternal side of the placenta were associated with higher insulin resistance index (homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance) during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (r(s) <= -0.27, P < 0.05). Finally, lower DNA methylation levels were associated with higher maternal circulating adiponectin levels throughout pregnancy (r(s) <= -0.26, P < 0.05). In conclusion, the ADIPOQ DNA methylation profile was associated with maternal glucose status and with maternal circulating adiponectin concentration. Because adiponectin is suspected to have insulin-sensitizing proprieties, these epigenetic adaptations have the potential to induce sustained glucose metabolism changes in the mother and offspring later in life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To verify whether the leptin gene epigenetic (DNA methylation) profile is altered in the offspring of mothers with gestational impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Placental tissues and maternal and cord blood samples were obtained from 48 women at term including 23 subjects with gestational IGT. Leptin DNA methylation, gene expression levels, and circulating concentration were measured using the Sequenom EpiTYPER system, quantitative real-time RT-PCR, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively. IGT was assessed after a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks of gestation., RESULTS: We have shown that placental leptin gene DNA methylation levels were correlated with glucose levels (2-h post-OGTT) in women with IGT (fetal side: rho=-0.44, P<=0.05; maternal side: rho=0.53, P<=0.01) and with decreased leptin gene expression (n=48; rho>=-0.30, P<=0.05) in the whole cohort. Placental leptin mRNA levels accounted for 16% of the variance in maternal circulating leptin concentration (P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: IGT during pregnancy was associated with leptin gene DNA methylation adaptations with potential functional impacts. These epigenetic changes provide novel mechanisms that could contribute to explaining the detrimental health effects associated with fetal programming, such as long-term increased risk of developing obesity and type 2 diabetes.

AB  - Parents of short children born SGA often report that their children have a serious lack of appetite and a low food intake. In this study we investigated food intake, by using a standardized 7-day food questionnaire, in 88 short SGA children before start of GH treatment. The intake was compared with the recommended daily intake (RDI) of age-matched children. We also compared the food intake of GH-treated children (n=62) with randomized controls (n=26) after 1 year of GH treatment. In addition, we evaluated the effect of food intake and GH treatment on body composition and serum levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin. Our study shows that caloric intake, fat and carbohydrate intake of short SGA children aged 5.9 (1.6) years was significantly lower compared to the RDI for age-matched children. One year of GH treatment resulted in a significant increase of caloric, fat, carbohydrate and protein intake compared to baseline. Compared to randomized controls, caloric, carbohydrate and protein intake increased significantly after 1 year of GH treatment. Short SGA children had significantly lower SDS scores for LBM, fat mass, skinfold (SF) and BMI compared to age-matched references. They also had significantly lower serum IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin levels. GH treatment resulted in a significant increase of height, LBM, BMI, IGF-I and IGFBP-3 SDS and a significant decrease of SF SDS and leptin SDS. In conclusion, our study shows that short SGA children have indeed a lower food intake than age-matched controls. During GH treatment the food intake increased significantly compared to baseline in contrast to the randomized control group. Copyright (c) 2006 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Maternal insulin sensitivity have strong correlation with fetal growth. The dysregulation of adiponectin and leptin is found in insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to determine whether there is an association between ultrasound fetal biometry and the maternal plasma cytokines and insulin concentrations at the beginning of gestational diabetes treatment., METHODS: 121 women with gestational diabetes diagnosed between 26th and 30th weeks, were included to the study. Plasma levels of adiponectin, leptin, insulin and glucose were quantified with the measurements and percentiles of the biparietal diameter, head circumference and abdominal circumference , estimated fetal weight and the actual birthweight., RESULTS: Associations between both of the adipokines and fetal biometry measurements were not evident. There were also no differences in their serum concentrations between groups of women with and without accelerated fetal growth . Adiponectin negatively correlated with pre-pregnancy BMI (r=-0.366, p=0.01). Leptin positively correlated with pre - pregnancy BMI (r=0.42, p=0.002), fasting insulin (r=0.51, p=0.0006) and HOMA-IR (r=0.43, p=0.005). No association was found between adiponectin, leptin, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and neonatal birth weight or birth weight percentile., CONCLUSION: The results of this study imply that adiponectin, leptin and insulin maternal plasma concentrations in the third trimester do not have influence on fetal growth in gestational diabetes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fetal growth is determined by genetic factors and placental supply. There is evidence that insulin might contribute to the up-regulation of placental transporter activity. The dysregulation of adiponectin and leptin is found in insulin resistance. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relation of maternal plasma cytokine and insulin concentrations in the first trimester of pregnancy to fetal growth., METHODS: 55 women with singleton pregnancy, between 12th and 14th weeks of gestation, were included to the study. Plasma concentrations of adiponectin, leptin, insulin and glucose were analyzed together with fetal ultrasound measurements and neonatal birth weight. The HOMA-IR were calculated (fasting insulin (microU/ml) x fasting glucose (mmol/l/22.5) to assess the insulin sensitivity., RESULTS: Mean concentrations of adiponectin, leptin and insulin were 15.29 +/- 13.83 microg/ml, 6.93+/-5.39 ng/ml and 43.59+/-26.28, respectively. The average insulin resistance defined by HOMA-IR was 1.35+/-0.8. The ratios of adiponectin to leptin, adiponectin to insulin and HOMA-IR were calculated. The percentiles of fetal crown-rump length (CRL) were negatively correlated with adiponectin plasma concentration (r=-0.32; p<0.05), with no relation to leptin and insulin plasma concentration. Correlations between fetus CRL percentile and the ratio of adiponectin to leptin concentration (r=-0.37; p<0.02) and adiponectin to HOMA-IR (r=0.35; p<0.05) were also observed. No association between adiponectin, leptin, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR and neonatal birth weight or birth weight percentile was found. The percentile of fetal CRL in the 1st trimester was positively correlated with neonatal birth weight percentile (r=0.3; p<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study imply that maternal adiponectin concentration may play a role in early determination of fetal growth.

Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol 297: R291-R299, 2009. First published May 20, 2009; doi:10.1152/ajpregu.90497.2008.-A mismatch between fetal and postnatal environment can permanently alter the body structure and physiology and therefore contribute later to obesity and related disorders, as revealed by epidemiological studies. Early programming of adipose tissue might be central in this observation. Moreover, adipose tissue secretes adipokines that provide a molecular link between obesity and its related disorders. Therefore, our aim was to investigate whether a protein restriction during fetal life, followed by catch-up growth could lead to obesity in 9-mo-old male mice and could alter the adipose tissue gene expression profile. Dams were fed a low-protein (LP) or an isocaloric control (C) diet during gestation. Postnatal catch-up growth was induced in LP offspring by feeding dams with control diet and by culling LP litters to four pups instead of eight in the C group. At weaning, male mice were fed by lab chow alone (C) or supplemented with a hypercaloric diet (HC), to induce obesity (C-C, C-HC, LP-C, and LP-HC groups). At 9 mo, LP offspring featured increased relative fat mass, hyperglycemia, hypercholesterolemia, and hyperleptinemia. Using a microarray designed to study the expression of 89 genes involved in adipose tissue differentiation/function, we demonstrated that the expression profile of several genes were dependent upon the maternal diet. Among the diverse genes showing altered expression, we could identify genes encoding several enzymes involved in lipid metabolism. These results indicated that offspring submitted to early mismatched nutrition exhibited alterations in adipose tissue gene expression that probably increases their susceptibility to overweight when challenged after weaning with a HC diet.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the effects of different regimens of growth hormone (GH) treatment on serum leptin levels in 78 short prepubertal children born small for gestational age (SGA)., METHODS: The children were originally included in two independent multicenter trials, one in Belgium and one in the Nordic countries. SGA children were randomized either to remain untreated or to be treated with GH at a daily dose of 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3 IU/kg for 2 years. Thereafter, treatment was continued for another 2 years in the Nordic children, whereas it was discontinued in the Belgian children., RESULTS: In the GH treatment groups, a significant dose-dependent decrease in leptin levels was found during the first year of therapy, with a mean decrease of 13, 23 and 32% in the groups receiving GH at 0.1, 0.2 and 0.3 IU/kg, respectively. When high-dose treatment was interrupted, serum leptin increased within 1 year to pretreatment levels., CONCLUSION: Serum leptin levels in short children born SGA are transiently reduced by GH treatment in a dose-dependent fashion. The most pronounced changes in serum leptin were documented within the first year after initiation and withdrawal of high-dose GH treatment. Copyright 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel

AB  - The product of the obese (ob) gene, leptin, is an adipocyte-derived hormone that is involved in the regulation of appetite and body weight. This study was undertaken in order to describe the basal serum levels of leptin in prepubertal short children born small for gestational age (SGA) and their relationship with growth parameters, before and during growth hormone (GH) treatment. Eighty-nine prepubertal short children (66 boys, 23 girls; height standard deviation score (SDS), -5.4 to -2.0; age, 2.0 to 12.8 years) born SGA, 12 of whom (9 boys, 3 girls) had signs of Silver-Russell syndrome, were included in the study. Serum leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmunoassay. Leptin levels in the children born SGA were compared with those in a reference group of 109 prepubertal healthy children born at an appropriate size for gestational age (AGA). The mean (S.D.) change in height SDS was 0.11 (0.22) during the year before the start of GH therapy (0.1 IU/kg/day) and increased to 0.82 (0.44) during the first year (P < 0.001) and to 1.28 (0.59) during the 2-year period of GH therapy (P < 0.001). The children born SGA were significantly leaner than the reference group. An inverse correlation was found between leptin and chronological age in the SGA group (r = -0.31, P < 0.01). The mean serum level of leptin in the children born SGA who were older than 5.5 years of age was 2.8 micrograms/l which was significantly lower than the mean value of 3.7 micrograms/l found in the children born AGA of the same age range. The difference remained after adjustment of leptin levels for sex, age, body mass index (BMI) and weight-for-height SDS (WHSDSSDS). Leptin correlated with WHSDSSDS (r = 0.32, P < 0.001) and BMI (r = 0.36, P < 0.01) in the reference population, but not in the SGA group. No correlation was found between leptin and spontaneous 24-h GH secretion, insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-I or IGF-binding protein-3 levels, or with fasting insulin or cortisol levels. Leptin levels at the start of GH treatment were correlated with the growth response over both 1 year (r = 0.46, P < 0.001) and 2 years (r = 0.51, P < 0.001) of GH therapy. Using multiple regression analysis, models including leptin levels at the start of GH therapy could explain 51% of the variance in the growth response after 1 year and 44% after 2 years of GH treatment. In conclusion, serum leptin levels are reduced in short children born SGA and are inversely correlated with chronological age. Leptin concentrations correlate with the growth response to GH treatment and might be used as a marker for predicting the growth response to GH treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine associations of perinatal and 3-year leptin with weight gain and adiposity through 7 years., DESIGN AND METHODS: In Project Viva, plasma leptin from mothers at 26-28 weeks' gestation (n = 893), umbilical cord vein at delivery (n = 540), and children at 3 years (n = 510) was assessed in relation to BMI z-score, waist circumference, skinfold thicknesses, and dual X-ray absorptiometry body fat., RESULTS: 50.1% of children were male and 29.5% non-white. Mean (SD) maternal, cord, and age 3 leptin concentrations were 22.9 (14.2), 8.8 (6.4), and 1.8 (1.7) ng/ml, respectively, and 3- and 7-year BMI z-scores were 0.46 (1.00) and 0.35 (0.97), respectively. After adjusting for parental and child characteristics, higher maternal and cord leptin were associated with less 3-year adiposity. For example, mean 3-year BMI z-score was 0.5 lower (95% CI: -0.7, -0.2; P-trend = 0.003) among children whose mothers' leptin concentrations were in the top versus bottom quintile. In contrast, higher age 3 leptin was associated with greater weight gain and adiposity through age 7 [e.g., change in BMI z-score from 3 to 7 years was 0.2 units (95% CI: -0.0, 0.4; P-trend =0.05)]., CONCLUSION: Higher perinatal leptin was associated with lower 3-year adiposity, whereas higher age 3 leptin was associated with greater weight gain and adiposity by 7 years.

AB  - Physical activity (PA) during pregnancy is beneficial for mother and child. Little is known regarding the effects of PA on specific adipokines/myokines and their impact during pregnancy. This study investigates the correlation between PA during late pregnancy, body composition, and maternal levels of leptin, IL-6, and TNF-alpha at delivery. In a cross-sectional study of 91 pregnant participants (mean age 33.9 +/- 4.6 years) without gestational diabetes mellitus or preeclampsia, anthropometric data and blood samples were taken at delivery. PA during the third trimester was measured via the Pregnancy Physical Activity Questionnaire. Activities were ranked by intensity: sedentary (<1.5 metabolic equivalent (METs)), light (1.5-3.0 METs), moderate (3.0-6.0 METs), and vigorous activity (>6.0 METs). Leptin at delivery correlated positively with body composition and negatively with light PA intensity. Sedentary behaviour showed a positive correlation with IL-6 levels at delivery. Moderate activity during the last trimester, sedentary activity levels, and body composition had the greatest influence on maternal IL-6 at delivery. Completed weeks of pregnancy, moderate and light PA, and sedentary activity had the greatest influence on maternal TNF-alpha at delivery. PA during late pregnancy potentially affects circulating (adipo-)/myokines. Further studies are needed to examine causal relationships and the impact on maternal and new-born health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adequate nutrient supply is essential for optimal postnatal growth in very low birth weight (VLBW, birth weight<1,500 g) infants. Early growth may influence the risk of metabolic syndrome later in life., OBJECTIVE: To evaluate growth and blood metabolic markers (adiponectin, leptin, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1)) in VLBW infants participating in a randomized nutritional intervention study., DESIGN: Fifty VLBW infants were randomized to an enhanced nutrient supply or a standard nutrient supply. Thirty-seven infants were evaluated with growth measurements until 2 years corrected age (CA). Metabolic markers were measured at birth and 5 months CA., RESULTS: Weight gain and head growth were different in the two groups from birth to 2 years CA (weight gain: pinteraction=0.006; head growth: pinteraction=0.002). The intervention group improved their growth z-scores after birth, whereas the control group had a pronounced decline, followed by an increase and caught up with the intervention group after discharge. At 5 months CA, adiponectin concentrations were higher in the intervention group and correlated with weight gain before term (r=0.35) and nutrient supply (0.35<=r<=0.45). Leptin concentrations correlated with weight gain after term and IGF-1 concentrations with length growth before and after term and head growth after term (0.36<=r<=0.53)., CONCLUSION: Enhanced nutrient supply improved early postnatal growth and may have prevented rapid catch-up growth later in infancy. Adiponectin concentration at 5 months CA was higher in the intervention group and correlated positively with early weight gain and nutrient supply. Early nutrition and growth may affect metabolic markers in infancy.Clinical Trial Registration (ClinicalTrials.gov) no.: NCT01103219.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Nutritional status is an important determinant of growth, and previous studies have indicated that this is due, at least in part, to an increased target-tissue sensitivity to GH. An attractive candidate for mediating this effect is leptin, a hormone secreted by the adipose tissue. The aim of this study was to investigate if there was a connection between GH-binding protein (GHBP) and leptin., DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the relationship between serum levels of leptin and those of GHBP in 229 prepubertal children. These included 107 healthy children with normal GH secretion, 55 GH-deficient (GHD) children and 55 children born small for gestational age (SGA) sampled on one occasion for GHBP and leptin, and 12 healthy children followed longitudinally at monthly interval for 1 year., RESULTS: In the healthy children and in those born SGA, the serum concentration of GHBP was positively correlated with that of leptin (r = 0.65, P < 0.001; r = 0.74, P < 0.001 respectively). There was no correlation between GHBP and leptin in the group of children with GHD (r = 0.27, not significant). This means that leptin alone explained 42% of the variation of GHBP in the healthy group and 55% in the SGA group. The correlation remained after adjustment for body mass index and age in the healthy children (r = 0.57, P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.33) and for children born SGA (r = 0.74, P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.55). There was a positive correlation between the intra-individual monthly changes in GHBP and changes in leptin respectively, in the 12 healthy children followed longitudinally, the mean of the correlation coefficients was 0.38 (median = 0.29; range 0.03 to 0.86; P < 0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: There was a highly significant correlation between serum levels of leptin and those of GHBP, except in children with GHD. The possibility that leptin could mediate the effects of body fat mass on GH sensitivity, therefore, merits further investigation.

AB  - Background. Several studies have suggested that increased oxidative stress during pregnancy may be associated with adverse maternal and foetal outcomes. As selenium is an essential mineral with an antioxidant role, our aim was to perform a systematic review of the existing literature reporting the effects of selenium supplementation during pregnancy on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Materials and Methods. Six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, and PubMed) were searched for studies reporting the effects of selenium supplementation during pregnancy and the postpartum period on maternal and neonatal outcomes. Only randomised controlled trials on human subjects reported in English and published up to October 2021 were included. Quality assessments were conducted using the modified Downs and Black quality assessment tool. Data were extracted using a narrative synthesis. Results. Twenty-two articles were included in our systematic review (seventeen reported on maternal outcomes, two on newborn outcomes, and three on both). Maternal studies reported the effects of selenium supplementation in the prevention of thyroid dysfunction, gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension/preeclampsia, oxidative stress, postpartum depression, premature rupture of membranes, intrauterine growth retardation, breastmilk composition, and HIV-positive women. Newborn studies reported the effects of maternal selenium supplementation on foetal oxidation stress, foetal lipid profile, neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, and newborn outcomes in HIV-positive mothers. The majority of studies were inappropriately designed to establish clinical or scientific utility. Of interest, four studies reported that selenium supplementation reduced the incidence of thyroid dysfunction and permanent hypothyroidism during the postpartum period by reducing thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibody titres. Conclusion. The evidence supporting selenium supplementation during pregnancy is poor and there is a need for appropriately designed randomised controlled trials before routine use can be recommended.Copyright © 2022 Koushik Biswas et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report on the effect of growth hormone (GH) treatment on final height (FH) and to describe the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system, ghrelin, and adiponectin (ADPN) in children with Seckel syndrome., SUBJECTS AND RESULTS: Four severely growth-retarded Iraqi siblings (two girls and two boys) with Seckel syndrome were referred at ages 16.5, 14.4, 12.4, and 10.4 years. They were born at term, but their growth was retarded and birth weight ranged between 1 and 1.5 kg. The children were healthy and had a normal response to GH provocative test. Long-term GH treatment of the youngest brother and sister increased the FH by 7.2 and 3.4 cm, respectively, compared with their older brother and sister. At FH, body mass index standard deviation scores (BMISDS) ranged from -3.0 to -3.9. Serum levels of immunoreactive IGF-1, bioactive IGF-1, and IGF-binding protein 3 were all within normal to high range before GH treatment and increased after GH treatment. Fasting plasma ghrelin remained severely reduced. Despite low BMISDS, plasma ADPN was moderately reduced and showed an almost complete absence of the low-molecular-weight subform., CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the effect of GH treatment on FH in children with Seckel syndrome. GH may have increased FH. In addition to growth defects and reduced BMISDS, patients with Seckel syndrome are characterized by low fasting ghrelin levels, low total ADPN, and near deficiency of the low-molecular-weight ADPN subform. The possible significance of the hormonal changes requires further investigations.

AB  - Introduction: Visfatin is a recently identified adipokine with numerous metabolic and immunoregulatory properties that has been implicated in the regulation of the white adipose tissue (WAT) and significant changes in visfatin levels were reported during pregnancy. The aim of the study was to investigate dynamics of visfatin levels in maternal serum and human breast milk during a 180-d period after the delivery. Materials and methods: : Breast milk and venous blood samples were obtained from 24 healthy lactating women with uncomplicated, physiological pregnancy and appropriate-for-gestational age neonates and serum-milk sample duos were collected at the time of birth, at the 1-3, 12-14, 28-30, 88-90 and 178-180 postpartum. Results: Our study demonstrates that (1) visfatin is abundantly secreted into breast milk in humans, reaching approx. 100x higher concentrations compared to maternal serum; (2) visfatin concentrations in maternal serum show significant variations after the delivery and (3) visfatin concentration in colostrum could be used for prediction of the subsequent weight development (less/more severe weight loss during first 3 days after the birth) of the infant. Discussion: Our data suggest that visfatin could play an important role in regulation of adiposity of the infatn after the birth. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - AIM: The pathophysiology of pre-eclampsia, one of the leading causes of maternal mortality worldwide, still remains unclear. Recently, it has been suggested that impaired regulation of complex interactions among various adipokines plays an important role in the development of pre-eclampsia. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the two common polymorphisms of the leptin (LEP) and adiponectin (APM1) genes are associated with the development of pre-eclampsia and its related traits (gestational hypertension, proteinuria and various measures of reduced fetal growth ) in the Czech pre-eclamptic population., METHODS: The case-control study comprised a total of 123 pre-eclamptic women and 150 healthy controls of similar age and parity distribution. They were genotyped for the LEP -2548G/A (5'-untranslated region) and APM1 T94G (exon 2) polymorphisms using polymerase chain reaction., RESULTS: The allele frequency of the LEP -2548G polymorphism was 0.541 in the pre-eclamptic group versus 0.583 in the control group (P=0.578); the frequency of the APM1 94G polymorphism was 0.073 and 0.079 (P=0.628), respectively. No significant associations were detected between either of the two single nucleotide polymorphisms or any of the parameter biomarkers related to pre-eclampsia, such as gestational hypertension or proteinuria. However, the APM1 T94G polymorphism was significantly associated with a low birth weight in pre-eclamptic pregnancies, with mothers carrying the T-allele having an almost three-fold increase in the likelihood of giving birth to a child with a low birth weight for its gestational age (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 0.18-5.9; P=0.004)., CONCLUSIONS: The APM1 T94G and LEP -2548G/A polymorphisms do not seem to be major genetic determinants of susceptibility to pre-eclampsia in the Czech Caucasian population. However, evidence has been provided for possible APM1 T94G involvement in controlling the birth weight of children from pre-eclamptic pregnancies, thus supporting the hypothesis of T94G involvement in controlling the birth weight of newborns.

AB  - Objective: Premature pubarche (PP) is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome (MS). The aim was to evaluate if glucose-insulin metabolism, cardiovascular risk factors, familial cardiovascular risk factors (FCVRF) created a risk for insulin resistance (IR) and if PP was a risk factor alone for MS in normal weight prepubertal girls with PP., Methods: Thirty-five prepubertal, non-obese girls with PP with normal birth weight and 35 age-matched control girls were evaluated for FCVRF, anthropometric measurements, blood pressure, lipid profile, fasting blood glucose-insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), leptin, adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), androgen levels, and bone age. Oral glucose tolerance test was performed in PP participants. Homeostasis model of assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose/insulin ratio, atherogenic index (AI), and free androgen index (FAI) were calculated. PP participants were further stratified by FCVRF., Results: HbA1c, lipid profile, testosterone, leptin, adiponectin, TNF-alpha, HOMA-IR, glucose/insulin ratio, AI, and fasting glucose-insulin levels were similar. In the PP group FAI was significantly higher (p=0.001), whereas SHBG was significantly lower (p=0.010) than the control group. Leptin levels of FCVRF+ and FCVRF- subgroups were 15.2+/-9.1 and 9.7+/-7.2 ng/mL, respectively and the difference was significant (p=0.016)., Conclusion: As PP does not appear to be a risk factor alone for impaired glucose metabolism and IR in prepubertal non-obese girls with normal birth weight, it is our opinion that it is unnecessary to examine in detail such cases before puberty. Low SHBG levels in the PP group and high leptin levels in FCVRF+ subgroup might suggest that these may be predictive for MS in the future.

AB  - A growing body of evidence suggests the consumption of high-fat diet (HFD) during pregnancy to model maternal obesity and the associated increase in oxidative stress (OS), might act as powerful prenatal stressors, leading to adult stress-related metabolic or behavioral disorders. We hypothesized that administration of antioxidants throughout gestation might counteract the negative effects of prenatal exposure to metabolic challenges (maternal HFD feeding during pregnancy) on the developing fetus. In this study, female C57BL/6J mice were fed HFD for 13 weeks (from 5-weeks of age until delivery) and were exposed to the N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) antioxidant from 10-weeks of age until right before delivery. Body weight of the offspring was assessed following birth, up to weaning and at adulthood. The metabolic, neuroendocrine and emotional profile of the adult offspring was tested at 3-months of age. Prenatal HFD increased mother's body weight and offspring's weight at the time of weaning, when administered in conjunction with NAC. In females, NAC administration reduced high levels of leptin resulting from prenatal HFD. Prenatal NAC administration also resulted in greater glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity while increasing adiponectin levels, as well as increasing exploratory behavior, an effect accompanied by reduced plasma corticosterone levels in response to restraint stress. Analysis of glutathione levels in the hypothalamus and in brown adipose tissue indicates that, while HFD administration to pregnant dams led to reduced levels of glutathione in the offspring, as in the male hypothalamus, NAC was able to revert this effect and to increase glutathione levels both in the periphery (Brown Adipose Tissue, both males and females) and in the central nervous system (males). Overall, results from this study indicate that the body redox milieu should be tightly regulated during fetal life and that buffering OS during pregnancy can have important long-term consequences on metabolic and behavioral endpoints.

AB  - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a metabolic complication of pregnancy. The pathogenesis of GDM is considered to involve beta-cell dysfunction and insulin resistance (IR). GDM is associated with a significant risk of macrosomia in addition to a high probability of metabolic complications for the offspring. The precise mechanism underlying GDM remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to analyse the factors associated with insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction involved in the pathophysiology of GDM complicated with macrosomia compared with GDM without macrosomia. In addition, another aim of the present study was to assess the relationship between GDM complicated with macrosomia and anthropometric, clinical and paraclinical parameters. The following group of patients were recruited as part of a case-control study: Patients with GDM without macrosomia, patients with GDM complicated with macrosomia and healthy gestational controls. Blood samples were collected at the third trimester of pregnancy and tested for adiponectin, leptin, insulin, proinsulin and C-peptide. Homeostatic model assessment-IR (HOMA-IR), steady state beta-cell function (HOMA%B), insulin sensitivity (HOMA%S) and body mass index (BMI) were also calculated. All patients diagnosed with GDM showed an impairment in HOMA%B and a decrease in C-peptide maternal serum concentration. Additionally, diabetic status leading to the birth of offspring with macrosomia did not induce changes in the maternal serum levels of insulin, proinsulin, adiponectin or leptin, which was also the case in patients with GDM but not macrosomia. HOMA%B presented a stronger positive correlation with pre-pregnancy BMI and maternal weight gain, and a stronger negative correlation with adiponectin. Furthermore, HOMA%S in this group exhibited strong positive correlations with maternal serum levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) and aspartate aminotransferase, and a strong negative correlation with pre-pregnancy BMI. In the same patients, HOMA-IR was also found to have a high negative correlation with HDL levels, and highly positive correlations with gestational age and triglyceride levels. In conclusion, the present study suggests that the different correlations among the factors involved in the pathogenesis of GDM may explain the evolution of GDM pregnancy to macrosomia.

AB  - Aims. The aim of this study was to relate the levels of glucose, insulin, C-peptide, leptin and adiponectin in the maternal and umbilical vein serum to the birth weight in T1DM and healthy pregnancies. Methods. The study included 120 pregnant women divided into 4 groups: 30 suffering from type 1 diabetic pregnancy (T1DM) who gave birth to eutrophic and 30 who gave birth to macrosomic infants; 30 from Control group (CTRL) who gave birth to eutrophic and 30 who gave birth to macrosomic infants. Serum insulin, C-peptide, leptin and adiponectin levels were quantified by ELISA. Results. Fetal macrosomia is associated with higher level of leptin in the fetal serum in both groups (T1DM: P=0.049; CTRL: P=0.031). Fetal levels of glucose and insulin have an influence on birth weight in the Control group (glucose: P=0.002; insulin: P=0.015). Adiponectin levels are higher in the maternal (p=0.001) and fetal serum (p<0.001) in eutrophic newborns of healthy pregnant women compared to the macrosomic newborns. Conclusion. The fetal growth is a complex process. Our results confirmed the relation between leptin and insulin levels and birth weight. They also suggest that adiponectin may be involved in the fetal growth.Copyright © 2014, Hrvatsko Drustvo Ginekologa i Opstetricara. All rights reserved.

AB  - AIMS: To determine predictors of neonatal adiposity and differences in associations by fetal sex in women with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), normal-weight and overweight (BMI >= 25 kg/m2) normal glucose-tolerant women (NGT)., METHODS: Skinfold thickness was measured in 576 newborns, and cord blood leptin, c-peptide and lipids in 327 newborns in a multi-centric prospective cohort study., RESULTS: Compared to neonates of normal-weight NGT women (327), neonates of women with GDM (97) were more often large-for-gestational age (LGA) (16.5% vs 8.6%, p = 0.024) ,but the macrosomia rate (8.2% vs 5.8%, p = 0.388), sum of skinfolds (13.9 mm +/- 2.9 vs 13.3 mm +/- 2.6, p = 0.067), neonatal fat mass (1333.0 g +/- 166.8 vs 1307.3 g +/- 160.9, p = 0.356), and cord blood biomarkers were not significantly different. Compared to neonates of normal-weight NGT women, neonates of overweight NGT women (152) had higher rates of macrosomia (12.5% vs 5.8%, p = 0.012), LGA (17.1% vs 8.6%, p = 0.006), higher sum of skinfolds (14.3 mm +/- 2.6 vs 13.2 mm +/- 2.6, p < 0.001), neonatal fat mass (1386.0 g +/- 168.6 vs 1307.3 g +/- 160.9, p < 0.001), % neonatal fat mass > 90th percentile (15.2% vs 7.1%, p < 0.001), without significant differences in cord blood biomarkers. Maternal BMI, fasting glycemia, triglycerides, gestational weight gain, cord blood leptin ,and cord blood triglycerides were independent predictors for neonatal adiposity. Gestational weight gain was positively associated with adiposity in boys only., CONCLUSION: Compared to neonates of normal-weight NGT women, neonates of GDM women have higher LGA rates but similar adiposity, while neonates of overweight NGT women have increased adiposity. Limiting gestational weight gain might be especially important in the male fetus to reduce neonatal adiposity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of placental leptin in intrauterine cord leptin production and its relationship with neonatal anthropometry., METHODS: Forty women and their babies (40) were enrolled in this study. Placental tissues were assayed for leptin mRNA by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), and assayed for the obese gene protein leptin by Western-blot and immunohistochemistry. Blood was taken from the umbilical cord of the babies at delivery. Serum leptin was measured by radio-immunoassay. Neonatal anthropometric measurements were recorded within 48 hours after delivery. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between placental leptin, cord leptin and neonatal anthropometric measures., RESULTS: The obese gene was expressed in placental tissue at comparable or greater levels than that in adipose tissue. The placentas of the small for gestational age (SGA) neonates expressed leptin mRNA and protein at significantly lower levels than those of the appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates (P = 0.0034 and 0.0076), while the placentas of the large for gestational age (LGA) neonates expressed leptin mRNA and protein at significantly higher levels than those of the AGA neonates (P = 0.043 and 0.021). Linear regression analysis showed placental ob gene transcription and leptin translation correlated significantly with cord leptin (r = 0.39 and 0.43), and neonatal Ponderal Index (r = 0.66 and 0.69)., CONCLUSION: The placenta provides a source of leptin for the growing fetus, and this placental leptin might be a growth factor in intrauterine fetal development.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of placental leptin in intrauterine cord leptin production and its relationship with neonatal anthropometry., METHODS: Forty women and their babies were enrolled and approved by Xinhua Hospital (Shanghai, China) and Jiangbei Hospital (Nanjing, China) in this study. Placental tissue was assayed for leptin mRNA by reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction (RT/PCR), and assayed for ob gene protein, leptin, by Western-Blot and immunohistochemistry. Blood was taken from the umbilical cord of the babies at delivery. Serum leptin was measured by radio-immunoassay. Neonatal anthropometric measurements were recorded within 48 hours after delivery. Linear regression analysis was used to explore the relationship between placental leptin, cord leptin and neonatal anthropometric measures., RESULTS: Ob gene was expressed in placental tissue at comparable or greater levels than that in adipose tissue. Comparison of the relative levels of leptin to beta-actin mRNA by multiplex RT/PCR revealed that the placenta of the small for gestational age (SGA) neonates expressed leptin mRNA at significantly lower levels 0.61 +/- 0.15 than that of the appropriate for gestational age (AGA) neonates 0.83 +/- 0.20 (P = 0.0034), while the placenta of the large for gestational age (LGA) neonates expressed leptin mRNA at significantly higher levels 1.00 +/- 0.23 than that of the AGA neonates (P = 0.043). Immunohistochemical techniques showed the immunostaining pattern in the cytoplasm of trophoblastic cells. Western-blot showed that the placenta of the SGA neonates expressed leptin at significantly lower levels 0.26 +/- 0.05 ng/mg than that of the AGA neonates 0.34 +/- 0.09 ng/mg (P = 0.007 6), while the placenta of the LGA neonates expressed leptin at significantly higher levels 0.43 +/- 0.10 ng/mg than that of the AGA neonates (P = 0.021). Linear regression analysis showed placental ob gene transcription and leptin translation correlated significantly with cord leptin (r = 0.39 and 0.43), and neonatal Ponderal Index (r = 0.66 and 0.69)., CONCLUSIONS: Placenta provides a source of leptin for the growing fetus, and this placental leptin might be a growth factor in intrauterine fetal development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) followed by rapid weight gain during early life has been suggested to be the initial sequence promoting central adiposity and insulin resistance. However, the link between fetal and early postnatal growth and the associated anthropometric and metabolic changes have been poorly studied., METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Over the first year of post-natal life, changes in body mass index, skinfold thickness and hormonal concentrations were prospectively monitored in 94 infants in whom the fetal growth velocity had previously been measured using a repeated standardized procedure of ultrasound fetal measurements. 45 infants, thinner at birth, had experienced previous FGR (FGR+) regardless of birth weight. Growth pattern in the first four months of life was characterized by greater change in BMI z-score in FGR+ (+1.26+/-1.2 vs +0.58 +/-1.17 SD in FGR-) resulting in the restoration of BMI and of fat mass to values similar to FGR-, independently of caloric intakes. Growth velocity after 4 months was similar and BMI z-score and fat mass remained similar at 12 months of age. At both time-points, fetal growth velocity was an independent predictor of fat mass in FGR+. At one year, fasting insulin levels were not different but leptin was significantly higher in the FGR+ (4.43+/-1.41 vs 2.63+/-1 ng/ml in FGR-)., CONCLUSION: Early catch-up growth is related to the fetal growth pattern itself, irrespective of birth weight, and is associated with higher insulin sensitivity and lower leptin levels after birth. Catch-up growth promotes the restoration of body size and fat stores without detrimental consequences at one year of age on body composition or metabolic profile. The higher leptin concentration at one year may reflect a positive energy balance in children who previously faced fetal growth restriction.

AB  - Background Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a global epidemic associated with increased health expenditure, and low quality of life. Many non-genetic risk factors have been suggested, but their overall epidemiological credibility has not been assessed. Methods We searched PubMed to capture all meta-analyses and Mendelian randomization studies for risk factors of T2DM. For each association, we estimated the summary effect size, its 95% confidence and prediction interval, and the 12 metric. We examined the presence of small-study effects and excess significance bias. We assessed the epidemiological credibility through a set of predefined criteria. Results We captured 86 eligible papers (142 associations) covering a wide range of biomarkers, medical conditions, and dietary, lifestyle, environmental and psychosocial factors. Adiposity, low hip circumference, serum biomarkers (increased level of alanine aminotransferase, gamma-glutamyl transferase, uric acid and C-reactive protein, and decreased level of adiponectin and vitamin D), an unhealthy dietary pattern (increased consumption of processed meat and sugar-sweetened beverages, decreased intake of whole grains, coffee and heme iron, and low adherence to a healthy dietary pattern), low level of education and conscientiousness, decreased physical activity, high sedentary time and duration of television watching, low alcohol drinking, smoking, air pollution, and some medical conditions (high systolic blood pressure, late menarche age, gestational diabetes, metabolic syndrome, preterm birth) presented robust evidence for increased risk of T2DM. Conclusions A healthy lifestyle pattern could lead to decreased risk for T2DM. Future randomized clinical trials should focus on identifying efficient strategies to modify harmful daily habits and predisposing dietary patterns.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ghrelin exerts potent GH-releasing activity and stimulates food intake. Circulating ghrelin levels are increased in anorexia and cachexia, reduced in obesity and restored by weight recovery. Newborns are characterized by GH hypersecretion associated with low IGF-I levels reflecting peripheral GH resistance., STUDY DESIGN: The aim of our study was to measure cord ghrelin levels in 117 newborns appropriate for gestational age, born either at term or preterm., RESULTS: Ghrelin levels in cord blood (median; 25th-75th centile: 327.6; 206.0-413.0 pg/ml) were higher (P < 0.0001) than those in maternal blood at delivery (133.0; 89.0-173.7 pg/ml), without gender differences. A positive correlation between ghrelin levels in mothers and newborns (r = 0.26, P < 0.01) was observed. Ghrelin levels in newborns born at term (399.0; 229.0-438.0 pg/ml) were remarkably higher (P < 0.0001) than those in born preterm (208.0; 144.5-278.9 pg/ml). A clear positive association was present between ghrelin levels and gestational age. No association between ghrelin and GH, IGF-I, insulin, glucose and leptin levels were found., CONCLUSIONS: Cord ghrelin levels show clear gestational age-related dependency. The lack of any direct relationship between ghrelin and anthropometric or biochemical parameters in adequate for gestational age newborns does not support the hypothesis that ghrelin has major role in foetal GH secretion and growth.

AB  - Ghrelin, a new gastric-derived hormone, probably plays a major role in managing energy balance and the neuroendocrine response to starvation. Information about the age-related variation in ghrelin secretion is scanty. We measured circulating ghrelin levels in 93 full term newborns adequate for gestational age, in 39 normal children and in 19 lean healthy adults. Our findings demonstrate that ghrelin levels are independent of age and gender from birth to adulthood. Interestingly, ghrelin secretion at birth is not associated to body weight and hormonal parameters such as GH, insulin and leptin levels. On the other hand, ghrelin levels seem dependent on the type of delivery, being lower in newborns after caesarean section with respect to those after normal delivery.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In Fetal Growth Restriction 'fetal programming' may take place via DNA methylation, which has implications for short-term and long-term health outcomes. Small-for-gestational age fetuses are considered fetal growth restricted, characterized by brain-sparing when fetal Doppler hemodynamics are abnormal, expressed as a cerebroplacental ratio (CPR) <1. We aimed to determine whether brain-sparing is associated with altered DNA methylation of selected genes., METHODS: We compared DNA methylation of six genes in 41 small-for-gestational age placentas with a normal or abnormal CPR. We selected EPO, HIF1A, VEGFA, LEP, PHLDA2, and DHCR24 for their role in angiogenesis, immunomodulation, and placental and fetal growth. DNA methylation was analyzed by pyrosequencing., RESULTS: Growth restricted fetuses with an abnormal CPR showed hypermethylation of the VEGFA gene at one CpG (VEGFA-309, p = .001) and an overall hypomethylation of the LEP gene, being significant at two CpGs (LEP-123, p = .049; LEP-51, p = .020). No differences in methylation were observed for the other genes., CONCLUSIONS: VEGFA and LEP genes are differentially methylated in placentas of small-for-gestational age fetuses with brain-sparing. Hypermethylation of VEGFA-309 in abnormal CPR-placentas could indicate successful compensatory mechanisms. Methylation of LEP-51 is known to suppress LEP expression. Hypomethylation in small-for-gestational age placentas with abnormal CPR may result in hyperleptinemia and predispose to leptin-resistance later in life.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the consequences of low birth weight on glucose and lipid metabolism 48 hours after delivery., METHODS: We studied 136 small for gestational age (SGA) and 34 appropriate for gestational age (AGA) term neonates who were born in Santiago, Chile. Prefeeding venous blood was obtained 48 hours after birth for determination of glucose, free fatty acids, beta-hydroxy butyrate, insulin, C-peptide, leptin, sex hormone-binding globulin, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1), and cortisol., RESULTS: SGA newborns had lower glucose (SGA versus AGA, median [interquartile range]: 3.6 mmol/L [2.9-4.1 mmol/L] vs 3.9 mmol/L [3.6-4.6 mmol/L]) and insulin levels (31.3 pmol/L [20.8-47.9 pmol/L] vs 62.5 pmol/L [53.5-154.9]) than AGA infants, and they had higher glucose/insulin ratios (13.9 mg/dL/uIU/mL [8.6-19.1 mg/dL/uIU/mL] vs 8.2 mg/dL/uIU/mL [4.6-14.1 mg/dL/uIU/mL]). SGA infants also had higher levels of IGFBP-1 (5.1 nmol/L [4.4-6.7 nmol/L] vs 2.9 nmol/l [1.4-4.2 nmol/L]), free fatty acids (0.72 mEq/L [0.43-1.00 mEq/L] vs 0.33 mEq/L [0.26-0.54 mEq/L]) and beta-hydroxy butyrate (0.41 mEq/L [0.15-0.91 mEq/L] vs 0.09 mEq/L [0.05-0.13 mEq/L]). Sex-hormone binding globulin levels were not significantly different between the 2 groups., CONCLUSIONS: In early postnatal life, SGA infants display an increased insulin sensitivity with respect to glucose disposal but not with respect to suppression of lipolysis, ketogenesis, and hepatic production of IGFBP-1. It will be important to determine how these differential sensitivities to insulin vary with increasing age.

AB  - Circulating adiponectin reflects the degree of energy homeostasis and insulin sensitivity of adult individuals. Low abundance of the high molecular weight (HMW) multimers, the most active forms mediating the insulin-sensitizing effects of adiponectin, is indicative of impaired metabolic status. The increase in fetal adiponectin HMW compared with adults is a distinctive features of human neonates. To further understand the functional properties of adiponectin during fetal life, we have evaluated the associations of adiponectin with insulin sensitivity, body composition, and gender. Umbilical cord adiponectin, adiponectin complexes, and metabolic parameters were measured at term by elective cesarean delivery. The associations between adiponectin, measures of body composition, and insulin sensitivity were evaluated in relation to fetal gender in 121 singleton neonates. Higher total adiponectin concentrations in female compared with male fetuses (34.3+/-9.5 vs. 24.9+/-8.6, P<0.001) were associated with a 3.2-fold greater abundance in circulating HMW complexes (0.20+/-0.03 vs. 0.08+/-0.03, P<0.001, n=9). Adiponectin was positively correlated with neonatal fat mass (r=0.27, P<0.04) and percent body fat in female fetuses (r=0.28, P<0.03) and with lean mass in males (r=0.28, P<0.03). There was no significant correlation between cord adiponectin and fasting insulin concentrations or fetal insulin sensitivity as estimated by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). The gender dimorphism for plasma adiponectin concentration and complex distribution first appears in utero. In sharp contrast to the inverse correlation found in adults, the positive relationship between adiponectin and body fat is a specific feature of the fetus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A "mismatch" sequence of less prenatal weight gain and more postnatal weight gain may lead to ectopic lipid accumulation, and trigger the development of early adrenarche/pubarche and the activation of the gonadotropic axis resulting in early puberty and ending up in full-blown adolescent polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In the present study, we assess whether a low-dose combination of generics that collectively reduce ectopic fat through different pathways can slow down the accelerated maturation in "mismatch" girls with early puberty., METHODS: Randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 2a, study in 64 girls [age, 8.0-9.3 years; birthweight (BW) for gestational age in lower tertile (-1.96< Z-score <-0.44), body mass index (BMI) in upper tertile (+0.44< Z-score < +1.96) and early progressive puberty (Tanner B2 at 7.7-9.0 years)]. Pharmacological intervention will be with a half-dose version of SPIOMET (mini-spiomet), a combination that reverts the PCOS phenotype in "mismatch" adolescents; mini-spiomet will contain spironolactone (25 mg/day, to raise brown adipose tissue activity), pioglitazone (3.75 mg/day, to raise adiponectin and insulin sensitivity), and metformin (425 mg/day, to raise AMPK activity and GDF15). Recruitment: 1 year; double-blind treatment: 1 year; open follow-up: 1 year; analyses and reporting: 1 year., INTERVENTIONS: randomization (1:1) for placebo vs mini-spiomet., PRIMARY OUTCOME: annualized bone age advancement (0-1 year) by BoneXpert; secondary outcomes: insulin, IGF-I, high-molecular-weight adiponectin (HMW-adip), sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG), ultra-sensitive C-reactive protein (usCRP), androgens, luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), oestradiol, growth-and-differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand-14 (CXCL14), safety parameters, and quantification of hepato-visceral fat., DISCUSSION: The present study, if successful, may provide a first proof of the concept that the rapid maturation of girls with an upward mismatch between pre- and post-natal weight gain can be slowed down with a fixed low-dose combination of old and safe generics jointly targeting a reduction of ectopic fat without necessarily lowering body weight., TRIAL REGISTRATION: EudraCT 2021-006766-21.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SPROUTY2 (SPRY2) is a membrane-associated protein expressed by placental macrophages with regulatory roles in tissue growth and development. The SPRY2 locus was shown to be associated with body fat distribution and susceptibility to type 2 diabetes., OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether SPRY2 mRNA levels are related with maternal metabolic status and with placental weight. We also studied the association of placental mRNA of SPRY2 with macrophage-derived inflammatory genes., METHODS: A maternal metabolic profile [C-peptide, post-load glucose and high-molecular-weight (HMW) adiponectin] was assessed between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation in 200 control women delivering adequate-for-gestational-age (AGA) infants. Placentas and newborns were weighed at delivery. Placental mRNA levels of SPRY2 and of macrophage-derived inflammatory genes MMP2, TNFalpha and CD163 were quantified by real-time PCR. Women delivering small-for-gestational-age infants (SGA, n = 25) and women with gestational diabetes (GDM, n = 25) were also studied as validation groups for placental growth., RESULTS: In control women delivering AGA infants, placental SPRY2 mRNA levels showed positive associations with a more adverse maternal metabolic status (higher maternal C-peptide and post-load glucose and lower HMW adiponectin), with more placental weight and with a more placental inflammatory phenotype (higher placental mRNA levels of MMP2,TNFalpha and CD163) (all p < 0.05 to p = 0.001). Compared to AGA infants, placental weight and placental SPRY2 mRNA levels were lower in placentas from SGA infants and higher in placentas from women with GDM (all p < 0.0001)., CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a link between placental SPRY2 mRNA levels and placental growth, which may be modulated by maternal metabolic status and placental inflammation.

AB  - Context: A lower free T-4 (fT4), within the euthyroid range, has been shown in adults to associate with an adverse metabolic phenotype. Thyroid physiology changes significantly during gestation and affects maternal and fetal well-being. Objective: The aim of the study was to test the hypothesis that a lower serum fT4 in healthy euthyroid pregnant women is related to a less favorable metabolic phenotype and to fetal or placental weight. Design, Setting, Patients, and Outcome Measures: We examined associations of thyroid function tests (TSH and fT4) and the free T-3 (fT3)-to-fT4 ratio (as a proxy of deiodinase activity) with a metabolic profile [preload and postload glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high molecular-weight (HMW)-adiponectin, homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and serum lipids] in 321 healthy pregnant women. All women were euthyroid and had negative anti-thyroid peroxidase antibodies. None received thyroid hormone replacement. Blood tests were performed in women between 24 and 28 wk gestation. Placentas and new borns were weighed at birth. Results: Circulating TSH did not relate to metabolic parameters, but decreasing fT4 and increasing fT3-to-fT4 ratio associated with a less favorable metabolic phenotype, as judged by higher postload glucose, HbA1c, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and triglycerides, and by a lower HMW-adiponectinemia (all P <= 0.005). In multiple regression analyses, fT4 was independently associated with HbA1c (beta = -0.135; P = 0.038), HMW-adiponectin (beta = 0.218; P < 0.001), and placental weight (beta = -0.185; P < 0.005), whereas the fT3-to-fT4 ratio was independently associated with maternal body mass index (beta = 0.265; P < 0.001), HMW-adiponectinemia (beta = -0.237; P < 0.002), HOMA-IR (beta = 0.194; P = 0.014), and placental weight (beta = 0.174; P = 0.020). Conclusion: In pregnant women without a history of thyroid dysfunction, lower concentrations of fT4 and a higher conversion of fT4 to fT3, as inferred by changes in the fT3-to-fT4 ratio, were found to be associated with a less favorable metabolic phenotype and with more placental growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The growth of the fetus is a complex process influenced by multiple factors. Studies have highlighted the important role of biochemical growth markers such as leptin and adiponectin on fetal growth., OBJECTIVE: To compare fetal growth trajectories with biochemical growth markers from maternal blood samples at 28 weeks' gestation, cord blood samples at birth, and in child blood samples at 5 years of age from mother-infant pairs who were part of the longitudinal ROLO study., METHODS: 781 mother-infant pairs from the ROLO and ROLO Kids study were included. Ultrasound measurements and birth weight were used to develop fetal growth trajectory groups for estimated abdominal circumference and estimated weight. Blood serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, insulin, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 from maternal, cord, and 5-year child samples were recorded. ANOVA and chi-square tests were applied to test the associations between fetal growth trajectory membership and maternal and child biochemical growth indicators. The influence of child sex was also investigated., RESULTS: Male sex was associated with a faster weight trajectory compared to females (p=0.001). At 28 weeks' gestation, maternal leptin levels were significantly higher in mothers with a fetus on a slower estimated abdominal circumference trajectory compared to fast (25616 [IQR: 11656.0 to 35341.0] vs. 14753.8 [IQR: 8565.4 to 24308.1], p < 0.001) and maternal adiponectin levels were lower in fetuses on a slower estimated abdominal circumference trajectory compared to a fast trajectory (22.4 [IQR: 13.6 to 35.9] vs. 27.6 [IQR: 17.6 to 46.3], p=0.027). No associations were noted with inflammatory markers. No associations were identified between fetal growth trajectories and growth markers at 5 years of age., CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that male sex is associated with an accelerated estimated weight trajectory. Furthermore, high leptin and low adiponectin in maternal serum in late gestation are associated with a slower fetal growth trajectory. No associations were identified with blood growth markers after pregnancy. Copyright © 2020 H. C. Bartels et al.

AB  - Hookworm infection is associated with poor nutritional outcomes, anemia, and impaired cognitive performance. We examined the association between maternal hookworm infection and birth outcomes in a cohort of women in Leyte, Philippines. We observed poor intrauterine growth characteristics associated with maternal hookworm only among male offspring, with lower birth weight, head circumference, and placental surface area. Male neonates also had higher insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2) and lower adiponectin in cord blood. These data intriguingly suggest nutritional impacts of maternal hookworm infection during pregnancy may be divergent based on sex of the offspring. Copyright © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to compare glucose, lipids, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in women with gestational diabetes mellitus treated with metformin or insulin and in cord plasma of their offspring and to examine how these markers relate to infant size at birth., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Women with gestational diabetes mellitus were randomly assigned to metformin or insulin in the Metformin in Gestational Diabetes trial. Fasting maternal plasma glucose, lipids, and CRP were measured at randomization, 36 weeks' gestation, and 6-8 weeks postpartum as well as in cord plasma. Women with available cord blood samples (metformin n = 236, insulin n = 242) were included., RESULTS: Maternal plasma triglycerides increased more from randomization to 36 weeks' gestation in women treated with metformin (21.93%) versus insulin (9.69%, P < 0.001). Maternal and cord plasma lipids, CRP, and neonatal anthropometry did not differ between treatments. In logistic regression analyses adjusted for confounders, the strongest associations with birth weight >90th centile were maternal triglycerides and measures of glucose control at 36 weeks., CONCLUSIONS: There were few differences in circulating maternal and neonatal markers of metabolic status and no differences in measures of anthropometry between the offspring of women treated with metformin and the offspring of women treated with insulin. There may be subtle effects of metformin on maternal lipid function, but the findings suggest that treating gestational diabetes mellitus with metformin does not adversely affect lipids or CRP in cord plasma or neonatal anthropometric measures.

AB  - CONTEXT: Adiponectin is a recognized protective risk marker for cardiovascular disease in adults and is associated with an optimal lipid profile. The role of adiponectin at birth is not well understood, and its relationship with the neonatal lipid profile is unknown. Because ethnic disparities in cardiovascular risk have been attributed to low adiponectin and its associated low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), investigation at birth may help determine the etiology of these risk patterns., OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to investigate the relationship between neonatal adiponectin and lipid profile at birth in two ethnic groups in cord blood., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Seventy-four healthy mothers and their newborns of South Asian and White European origin were studied in this cross-sectional study at St. Mary's Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Serum adiponectin, total cholesterol, HDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triglyceride levels were measured in umbilical venous blood at birth and in maternal blood collected at 28 wk gestation., RESULTS: Cord adiponectin was significantly inversely associated with cord LDL-C (r = -0.32; P = 0.005) but not HDL-C. In a multiple regression analysis, cord LDL-C remained the most significant association of cord adiponectin (beta = -0.13; P < 0.001). We did not find any significant ethnic differences in cord adiponectin or lipids with the exception of triglycerides, which were significantly lower in South Asian newborns (P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: This is the first report of an inverse relationship between cord adiponectin and LDL-C at birth. In contrast to adult studies, we found no significant association between adiponectin and HDL-C in cord blood. Our results and the strong independent association between adiponectin and HDL-C observed in adult studies suggest a role for adiponectin in lipid metabolism. Ethnic differences in adiponectin may arise after birth.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the relationship between maternal adiponectin (mAdiponectin) and cord blood adiponectin (cbAdiponectin) multimeric forms (high molecular weight [HMW], medium molecular weight [MMW], and low molecular weight [LMW]) in a cohort of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and normal glucose-tolerant (NGT) pregnant women., RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 212 women with a singleton pregnancy, 132 with NGT and 80 with GDM, and their offspring were studied. Maternal blood was obtained in the early third trimester and cord blood was obtained at delivery. Total adiponectin and the multimeric forms of adiponectin were determined in cord blood and maternal serum. Spearman rank correlation and stepwise linear correlation analysis were used to assess the relationship between cbAdiponectin levels and clinical and analytical parameters., RESULTS: No differences in cbAdiponectin concentration or its multimeric forms were observed in the offspring of diabetic mothers compared with NGT mothers. The HMW-to-total adiponectin ratio was higher in cord blood than in maternal serum, whereas the MMW- and LMW-to-total adiponectin ratio was lower. Cord blood total and HMW adiponectin levels were positively correlated with birth weight and the ponderal index (PI), whereas cord blood MMW adiponectin was negatively correlated with the PI. In addition, cbAdiponectin and its multimeric forms were correlated with mAdiponectin concentrations. In the multivariate analysis, maternal multimeric forms of adiponectin emerged as independent predictors of cbAdiponectin, its multimers, and their distribution., CONCLUSIONS: cbAdiponectin concentrations are independently related to mAdiponectin levels and unrelated to the diagnosis of GDM. Maternal multimeric forms of adiponectin are independent predictors of the concentrations of cbAdiponectin and its multimeric forms at delivery.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The placental glucose transporter - 1 (GLUT-1) is involved in the transplacental glucose transport to the fetus. GLUT-1 expressions are increased in diabetic pregnancies and associated with altered fetal growth. However, the factors regulating the GLUT-1 expressions are largely unknown. We hypothesised that maternal adipokines and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) modulate the placental expressions of GLUT-1 through the activation of insulin/IGF-1 signalling which may contribute to a fetal overgrowth in GDM., METHODS: Maternal blood, cord blood and placental samples were collected from GDM and control pregnant women (CPW). The biochemical parameters, IGF1, adipokines, and high sensitive C- reactive protein were measured. We analysed the placental expressions of GLUT-1 and proteins related to insulin/IGF-1 signalling - insulin receptor -beta, insulin receptor substrate - 1, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase p110alpha, phospho Akt-1, phospho extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2, and nuclear factor-kappaB p65 in GDM and CPW., RESULTS: Increased maternal IGF-1 and decreased adiponectin levels were found in the GDM women. Maternal IGF-1 levels were positively correlated, whereas adiponectin levels were negatively correlated with the birth weight of GDM newborns. Increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK 1/2 was found in the placenta of GDM women. Placental expressions of GLUT-1 were significantly higher in the GDM women and positively correlated to the maternal IGF-1 levels in the GDM group., DISCUSSION: Decreased maternal adiponectin and increased IGF-1 levels might have caused increased GLUT-1 expression via the increased activation of insulin/IGF-1 signalling in the placenta of GDM women which might have influenced the fetal growth.

AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the change in maternal serum leptin levels in preeclampsia and to study the relationship between maternal serum leptin and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), body mass index (BMI), newborn weight, and proteinuria. Eighty-five pregnant women were included in this prospective study, of whom 50 were preeclamptic and 35 were normotensive. Maternal serum leptin levels were measured by the radioimmunoassay technique and TSH levels were measured by the electrochemiluminescence immunoassay method. The maternal serum leptin levels of preeclamptic and normotensive pregnant women were compared. In each group, the relationship between maternal serum leptin levels and TSH levels, BMI, newborn weight, and proteinuria was evaluated. The maternal serum leptin level was significantly higher in the preeclamptics than in the normotensive pregnant women. In the preeclamptic group, there was a strong positive correlation between maternal serum leptin levels and BMI (r =- 0.80; p < 0.001), a very weak positive correlation between maternal serum leptin levels and proteinuria (r = 0.305; p < 0.05), and a very weak inverse correlation between maternal serum leptin levels and birth weight (r = -0.377; p < 0.01). In the same group, there was no correlation between maternal serum leptin and serum TSH levels (r = 0.22; p > 0.05; Pearson correlation test). Leptin may be involved in the pathology of preeclampsia, and elevated maternal serum leptin levels may be a marker for the early stages of preeclampsia in pregnant women.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: To test the hypothesis that the bone metabolism of a growth-restricted foetus is regulated by genetic, placental and/or foetal factors through leptin, we investigated the foetal bone turnover in monochorionic pregnancies complicated with or without twin-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS)., METHODS: Maternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational-age-matched monochorionic twins with (n=15) and without (n=15) TTTS. The samples were assayed for leptin, cross-linked carboxyl terminal telo-peptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and pro-peptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen by radioimmunoassay (RIA)., RESULTS: In the growth-restricted donor twin, the plasma concentration of leptin (P < 0.001), PICP (P < 0.001) was lower, while that of ICTP (P < 0.001) was higher than the recipient twin of the TTTS group. In contrast, leptin, PICP and ICTP were comparable in non-TTTS twins. In the recipient twin of TTTS and non-TTTS twins, leptin was positively associated with PICP (r=0.73; n=45, P < 0.001) and negatively with ICTP (r=-0.68; n=45; P < 0.001). No such association was found between leptin and bone marker in the growth-restricted donor twin of the TTTS group., CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that, in AGA twins, leptin maintains bone metabolism by inhibiting resorption and enhancing bone formation. In contrast, growth-restricted donor twins have high bone turnover and this does not seem to be due to leptin deficiency.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relationship between IGF-I-IGF binding protein (IGFBP)-1 and leptin levels with type 1 collagen markers of bone turnover in dichorionic twins with or without discordant birth weight of 20% or greater., METHODS: Maternal and cord bloods were collected from gestational age-matched dichorionic twins with (n = 16) or without (n = 16) discordant birth weight. The samples were assayed for cross-linked carboxyl terminal telopeptide (ICTP, a marker of bone resorption) and propeptide (PICP, a marker of bone formation) of type I collagen, leptin, IGF-I, and IGFBP-1 by RIA., RESULTS: The intrauterine growth-restricted (IUGR) twins of the discordant group had higher fetal ICTP (P < 0.001) and IGFBP-1 (P < 0.001) levels, whereas PICP (P < 0.001), IGF-I (P < 0.001), and leptin (P < 0.001) were lower than the cotwins with normal weight (AGA). In contrast, concentrations of IGF-I, IGFBP-1, ICTP, PICP, and leptin were comparable between concordant twin pairs. Leptin levels were positively correlated with PICP (r = 0.61; P < 0.001) and negatively with ICTP (r = -0.57; P < 0.001) in concordant and AGA twins but not in IUGR twins. In IUGR twins, IGF-I had positive association with PICP (r = 0.76; P < 0.001) and negative association with ICTP (r= -0.76; P < 0.001), whereas IGFBP-1 was negatively correlated with PICP levels (r = -0.65; P < 0.01). No such association was found in concordant and AGA twins., CONCLUSION: These data suggest that IUGR twins had high bone turnover, which is independent of maternal factors and perhaps may be due to altered IGF axis.

AB  - Leptin is an endocrine and a growth factor which is important for regulation of body fat, feeding, and energy homeostasis. The anti-obesity function of leptin has been recently extended to reproduction, puberty and pregnancy as an endocrine signal to the hypothalamus. Leptin controls the functional integrity of the feto-placental unit thereby maintaining pregnancy by virtue of its immunomodulatory property via T lymphocytes or other proto-oncogenes. Dysregulation of autocrine/paracrine function of leptin at feto-placento-maternal interface may be implicated in the pathogenesis of recurrent miscarriage gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine fetal growth retardation including disturbance of fetal bone turnover. This review will focus on the role of leptin in normal and abnormal pregnancy and fetal growth. Copyright 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Malnutrition is a major problem in developing countries, and obesity and eating disorders are increasingly common in developing as well as developed countries. The reproductive axis is closely linked to nutritional status, especially undernutrition in the female, and inhibitory pathways involving detectors in the hind brain suppress ovulation in subjects with weight loss. Recovery may occur after minimal reacquisition of weight because energy balance is more important than body fat mass. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa affect up to 5% of women of reproductive age causing amenorrhoea, infertility and, in those who do conceive, an increased likelihood of miscarriage. Obesity can affect reproduction through fat cell metabolism, steroids and secretion of proteins such as leptin and adiponectin and through changes induced at the level of important homeostatic factors such as pancreatic secretion of insulin, androgen synthesis by the ovary and sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) production by the liver. WHO estimates that 9 to 25% of women in developed countries are severely obese, and obese mothers are much more likely to have obese children, especially if they have gestational diabetes. Obesity-associated anovulation may lead to infertility and to a higher risk of miscarriage. Management of anovulation with obesity involves diet and exercise as well as standard approaches to ovulation induction. Many obese women conceive without assistance, but pregnancies in obese women have increased rates of pregnancy-associated hypertension, gestational diabetes, large babies, Cesarean section and perinatal mortality and morbidity. Among contraceptors, the fear of weight gain affects uptake and continuation of hormonal contraceptives, although existing trials indicate that any such effects are small. For all methods of hormonal contraception, weight above 70 kg is associated with increased failure rates.

AB  - Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) predisposes to obesity and adipose dysfunction. We previously demonstrated IUGR-induced increased visceral adipose deposition and dysregulated expression of peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma 2 (PPAR gamma 2) in male adolescent rats, prior to the onset of obesity. In other studies, activation of PPAR gamma increases subcutaneous adiponectin expression and normalizes visceral adipose deposition. We hypothesized that maternal supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a PPAR gamma agonist, would normalize IUGR adipose deposition in association with increased PPAR gamma, adiponectin, and adiponectin receptor expression in subcutaneous adipose. To test these hypotheses, we used a well-characterized model of uteroplacental-insufficiency-(UPI-) induced IUGR in the rat with maternal DHA supplementation. Our primary findings were that maternal DHA supplementation during rat pregnancy and lactation (1) normalizes IUGR-induced changes in adipose deposition and visceral PPAR gamma expression in male rats and (2) increases serum adiponectin, as well as adipose expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors in former IUGR rats. Our novel findings suggest that maternal DHA supplementation may normalize adipose dysfunction and promote adiponectin-induced improvements in metabolic function in IUGR.

AB  - Childhood obesity is a growing epidemic. Early identification of high-risk groups will allow for the development of prevention strategies. Cord blood adipocytokines have been previously examined as biomarkers predicting future obesity. We conducted a systematic review looking at the association between cord blood leptin and adiponectin with adiposity up to 5 years of age. A literature review was performed between January 1994 and August 2020 using two bibliographic databases (Medline/Pubmed and EMBASE) and was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42017069024). Studies using skinfold thickness and direct methods of assessing body composition in full term neonates were considered. Partial correlation and multiple regression models were used to present the results. Meta-analysis was performed, were possible, using a random effects model. Cochran's Q test was used to assess heterogeneity and I2 statistics to calculate the percentage of variation across studies. The potential for publication bias was assessed using funnel plots. Data from 22 studies were retrieved and reviewed by two independent reviewers. Cord blood leptin was positively associated with adiposity at birth (r = 0.487; 95% CI: 0.444, 0.531) but was inversely related to adiposity up to 3 years of age. The association was not sustained at 5 years. There was a weak positive association between adiponectin in cord blood and adiposity at birth (r = 0.201; 95% CI: 0.125, 0.277). No correlation was found between cord blood adiponectin in young children, but data were limited. This review supports that cord blood leptin and adiponectin are associated with adiposity at birth. The results of this study provide insight into the role of adipocytokines at birth on future metabolic health and their potential use as risk stratification tools.

AB  - Obesity is the most common metabolic disease whose prevalence is increasing worldwide. This condition is considered a serious public health problem due to associated comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Perinatal morbidity related to obesity does not end with birth; this continues affecting the mother/infant binomial and could negatively impact on metabolism during early infant nutrition. Nutrition in early stages of growth may be essential in the development of obesity in adulthood, supporting the concept of "nutritional programming". For this reason, breastfeeding may play an important role in this programming. Breast milk is the most recommended feeding for the newborn due to the provided benefits such as protection against obesity and diabetes. Health benefits are based on milk components such as bioactive molecules, specifically hormones involved in the regulation of food intake. Identification of these molecules has increased in recent years but its action has not been fully clarified. Hormones such as leptin, insulin, ghrelin, adiponectin, resistin, obestatin and insulin-like growth factor-1 copeptin, apelin, and nesfatin, among others, have been identified in the milk of normal-weight women and may influence the energy balance because they can activate orexigenic or anorexigenic pathways depending on energy requirements and body stores. It is important to emphasize that, although the number of biomolecules identified in milk involved in regulating food intake has increased considerably, there is a lack of studies aimed at elucidating the effect these hormones may have on metabolism and development of the newborn. Therefore, we present a state-of-the-art review regarding bioactive compounds such as hormones secreted in breast milk and their possible impact on nutritional programming in the infant, analyzing their functions in appetite regulation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the leptin level in healthy pregnant mothers at term and in their newborns and its relationship to their body mass index (BMI) and gender of the newborn., METHODS: The leptin level was measured in serum of 187 pregnant women at term delivering at the King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in July 2001 and their newborns. Correlation studies were made between leptin level and their growth parameters, and gender of the newborns., RESULTS: Leptin level of the mothers was significantly higher compared to their newborns. There was a significant correlation between leptin level in the pregnant women and their weight, BMI, and the newborns leptin level and weight, but not their height or BMI. A statistically significant difference was found between male and female newborns plasma leptin level. A significant correlation was found between male newborns leptin level and all their growth parameters, while in the female newborns there was no correlation between their leptin level and BMI., CONCLUSION: Leptin plays an important role in providing a growth promoting signal during pregnancy, but the fat mass does not seem to be the most important predictor of cord leptin level.

AB  - IMPACT: This study aims to advance the understanding of the biological mechanisms associated with feeding disturbances in infants born to diabetic mothers through non-invasive salivary gene expression analyses and body composition measurements at birth. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: To determine if non-invasive salivary gene expression analyses and body composition measurements at birth could elucidate biological mechanisms associated with aberrant feeding behaviors and disrupted metabolic profiles commonly seen in infants born to diabetic mothers. METHODS/ STUDY POPULATION: This prospective cohort study enrolls subjects born at >=35 weeks' gestation without a history of intrauterine growth restriction or major congenital anomalies. The diabetic cohort is defined as infants born to mothers with gestational diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome is salivary expression of the hunger signaling genes, AMPK and NPY2R. Secondary outcomes include infant body composition measurements, obtained by skinfold measurement and/or air displacement plethysmography, and salivary expression of the adipokines, leptin, ghrelin, and adiponectin. Multiple logistic regression will be used to determine which factors are associated with AMPK and NPY2R expression. RESULTS/ ANTICIPATED RESULTS: We propose that poor oral intake seen in infants of diabetic mothers may be due to alterations in the expression of hunger signaling genes (decreased expression of AMPK; increased expression of NPY2R) resulting in a diminished feeding drive in these large for gestational age infants. In addition, infant adiposity and the expression of genes involved in the adipoinsular axis will be inversely proportional to feeding volume intake. Namely, increased neonatal fat mass will be associated with increased expression of leptin and decreased expression of ghrelin and adiponectin. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: Infants of diabetic mothers are at higher risk of poor oral feeding in the newborn period. This study aims to elucidate the link between neonatal body composition, adipoinsular axis, and hunger signaling to explain this unique feeding phenotype.

AB  - Background: There are no data on the metabolic consequences of post-term birth (>= 42 weeks gestation). We hypothesized that post-term birth would adversely affect insulin sensitivity, as well as other metabolic parameters and body composition in childhood. Methods: 77 healthy pre-pubertal children, born appropriate-for-gestational-age were studied in Auckland, New Zealand: 36 born post-term (18 boys) and 41 (27 boys) born at term (38-40 weeks gestation). Primary outcome was insulin sensitivity measured using intravenous glucose tolerance tests and Bergman's minimal model. Other assessments included fasting hormone concentrations and lipid profiles, body composition from whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, and inflammatory markers. Results: Insulin sensitivity was 34% lower in post-term than in term children (7.7 vs. 11.6 x10(-4).min(-1).(mU/l); p<0.0001). There was a compensatory increase in acute insulin response among post-term children (418 vs 304 mU/l; p=0.037), who also displayed lower glucose effectiveness than those born at term (2.25 vs 3.11 x10(-2).min(-1); p=0.047). Post-term children not only had more body fat (p=0.014) and less fat-free mass (p=0.014), but also had increased central adiposity with more truncal fat (p=0.017) and greater android to gynoid fat ratio (p=0.007) compared to term controls. Further, post-term children displayed other markers of the metabolic syndrome: lower normal nocturnal systolic blood pressure dipping (p=0.027), lower adiponectin concentrations (p=0.005), as well as higher leptin (p=0.008) and uric acid (p=0.033) concentrations. Post-term boys (but not girls) also displayed a less favourable lipid profile, with higher total cholesterol (p=0.018) and LDL-C (p=0.006) concentrations, and total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio (p=0.048). Conclusions: Post-term children have reduced insulin sensitivity and display a number of early markers of the metabolic syndrome. These findings could have important implications for the management of prolonged pregnancies. Future studies need to examine potential impacts later in life, as well as possible underlying mechanisms.

AB  - We recently showed from a Swedish cohort that nearly half of boys born postterm (>=42 weeks gestation) were overweight or obese at 16 years of age. We hypothesized that post-term children would display features of insulin resistance and the metabolic syndrome even in their pre-pubertal years. 90 healthy pre-pubertal children aged 4-11 years, with birth weight appropriate-for-gestational-age were studied: 36 children born post-term (18 boys and 18 girls) and 54 children (36 boys and 18 girls) born at term (38-40 weeks). Insulin sensitivity was measured using Bergman's minimal model. Other assessments included fasting lipid and hormonal profiles, body composition using whole-body dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring. Insulin sensitivity was reduced in post-term children (8.44+/-0.74 vs 13.55+/-0.89 x10-4 min-1 (mU/L); p<0.0001). Post-term children had an adverse lipid profile, with higher total cholesterol (4.26+/-0.17 vs 3.92+/- 0.11 mmol/l; p=0.023) and LDL (2.51+/-0.13 vs 2.25+/-0.08 mmol/l; p=0.016) concentrations. Further changes suggestive of the metabolic syndrome among post-term children included an increased android to gynoid fat ratio (0.74+/-0.03 vs 0.61+/-0.02; p=0.026), and a reduction in the normal nocturnal systolic blood pressure dip (8.2+/-1.0 vs 13.8+/-1.0%; p=0.016). Post-term children also had higher serum leptin (7.18+/-0.91 vs 3.67+/-0.41 ng/ml; p=0.011), lower adiponectin (8226+/-693 vs 10536+/- 556 ng/ml; p=0.046), and lower IGFBP1 (9.56+/-1.06 vs 18.03+/-1.59 ng/ml; p=0.032) concentrations. Our study shows for the first time that post-term children have early features of the metabolic syndrome, including reduced insulin sensitivity, adverse lipid profile, and increased abdominal adiposity.

AB  - Background: Chlordecone is an endocrine-disrupting chemical with well recognized estrogenic and progestagenic properties. This organochlorine insecticide was extensively used in the French West Indies from 1973 to 1993 to control the banana root borer. Due to its poor degradation in the environment, permanently polluted soil is responsible for the current contamination of the food chain and human beings. We aimed to examine the relationship of in utero exposure to chlordecone and thyroid (thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH], free tri-iodothyronine [FT3], free thyroxine [FT4]), metabolic (insulin growth-factor 1, leptin, adiponectin), and sex-steroid (dehydroepiandrosterone [DHEA], total testosterone [TT], dihydrotestosterone [DHT], estradiol [E2]) hormone levels in children at the age of seven years who participated in TIMOUN, an ongoing birth cohort in Guadeloupe., Methods: Chlordecone concentrations were measured in cord-blood at delivery. Thyroid, metabolic, and sex-steroid hormone levels were determined in the blood of children at seven years of age. Associations between in utero chlordecone exposure and hormone levels at seven years of age were assessed by multiple linear or logistic regression, controlling for confounding factors., Results: Among the study population (210 boys and 228 girls), chlordecone and hormone measurements were available for 124 boys and 161 girls. We found the third quartile of in utero chlordecone exposure relative to the lowest quartile to be associated with elevated TSH levels in girls and elevated DHEA, TT, and DHT levels in both sexes. Complementary non-linear analysis (spline regression) confirmed a significant non-linear trend for TSH in girls and DHEA and DHT in boys., Conclusion: In utero chlordecone exposure was associated with elevated levels of selected thyroid (TSH) and sex-steroid (DHEA, TT, and DHT) hormones at seven years in a non-monotonic dose response (inverted U) relationship. The implications for future health and reproductive function in puberty and adulthood should be determined.

AB  - Maternal adiponectin (ADN) levels are inversely correlated with birth weight, and ADN infusion in pregnant mice down-regulates placental nutrient transporters and decreases fetal growth. In contrast to the insulin-sensitizing effects in adipose tissue and muscle, ADN inhibits insulin signaling in the placenta. However, the molecular mechanisms involved are unknown. We hypothesized that ADN inhibits insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated amino acid transport in primary human trophoblasts by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPARalpha)-mediated ceramide synthesis. Primary human term trophoblast cells were treated with ADN and/or insulin. ADN increased the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and PPARalpha. ADN inhibited insulin signaling and insulin-stimulated amino acid transport. This effect was dependent on PPARalpha, because activation of PPARalpha with an agonist (GW7647) inhibited insulin signaling and function, whereas PPARalpha-small interfering RNA reversed the effects of ADN on the insulin response. ADN increased ceramide synthase expression and stimulated ceramide production. C2-ceramide inhibited insulin signaling and function, whereas inhibition of ceramide synthase (with Fumonisin B1) reversed the effects of ADN on insulin signaling and amino acid transport. These findings are consistent with the model that maternal ADN limits fetal growth mediated by activation of placental PPARalpha and ceramide synthesis, which inhibits placental insulin signaling and amino acid transport, resulting in reduced fetal nutrient availability.

AB  - Adiponectin has well-established insulin-sensitizing effects in non-pregnant individuals. Pregnant women who are obese or have gestational diabetes typically have low circulating levels of adiponectin, which is associated with increased fetal growth. Lean women, on the other hand, have high circulating levels of adiponectin. As a result, maternal serum adiponectin is inversely correlated to fetal growth across the full range of birth weights, suggesting that maternal adiponectin may limit fetal growth. In the mother, adiponectin is predicted to promote insulin sensitivity and stimulate glucose uptake in maternal skeletal muscle thereby reducing nutrient availability for placental transfer. Adiponectin prevents insulin-stimulated amino acid uptake in cultured primary human trophoblast cells by modulating insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation. Furthermore, chronic administration of adiponectin to pregnant mice inhibits placental insulin and mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling, down-regulates the activity and expression of key placental nutrient transporters and decreases fetal growth. Preliminary findings indicate that adiponectin binds to the adiponectin receptor-2 on the trophoblast cell and activates p38 MAPK and PPAR-alpha, which inhibits the insulin/IGF-1 signaling pathway. In contrast to maternal adiponectin, recent reports suggest that fetal adiponectin may promote expansion of adipose tissue and stimulate fetal growth. Regulation of placental function by adiponectin constitutes a novel physiological mechanism by which the endocrine functions of maternal adipose tissue influence fetal growth. These findings may help us better understand the factors determining birth weight in normal pregnancies and in pregnancy complications associated with altered maternal adiponectin levels such as obesity and gestational diabetes.

AB  - Intrauterine growth retardation/restriction (IUGR) is associated with fetal malnutrition. It has consequences for later life including increased incidence of obesity, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and metabolic syndrome. Adipokines (adiponectin and leptin), adropin, and endothelin-1 are associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome regulation. Intrauterine changes in these mediators could affect programming of later adult obesity and metabolic syndrome. Our objectives were to compare the levels of these mediators in both cord and maternal blood between IUGR pregnancies and control, healthy pregnancies, and to study the correlation of adipokines with adropin and endothelin-1 in maternal and cord blood in IUGR pregnancies as well as in healthy control pregnancies. Maternal and cord blood samples were taken from 16 women with IUGR pregnancies and 16 women with healthy pregnancies. Serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, adropin, and endothelin-1 were measured by ELISA. Maternal blood adropin levels were significantly lower in the IUGR group than in the control group; the other mediators did not differ significantly. There was a positive correlation between maternal blood adropin and endothelin levels. (r=0.731, P=0.001) in the control but not the IUGR group. Cord blood adropin and adiponectin levels were significantly lower in the IUGR group compared with the control group, while leptin or endothelin-1 did not differ significantly. There was a negative correlation between adropin and leptin (r=-0.704, P=0.001) in the IUGR but not the control group cord blood. There were also positive correlations between endothelin and adropin for both groups (r=0.594, P=0.006; r=0.560, P=0.010, respectively); to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of such a correlation. Differences in fetal expression of adropin and adiponectin in IUGR could influence programming of obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, and CVD in later life.

AB  - The aim in this study was to determine the factors affecting leptin and soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R) levels in term small for gestational age (SGA) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) newborns. The study group consisted of SGA (n=20) and AGA (n=20) newborns and their mothers. The leptin and sOB-R levels were tested using the ELISA method. The cord blood leptin concentrations were found significantly higher in the AGA group than in the SGA group (p=0.048). It was observed that cord blood leptin levels increased as body weight increased in the AGA group (r=0.681, p=0.001). The cord blood leptin levels were found higher in female infants than male infants (p=0.021). The plasma leptin levels were higher in the mothers of SGA neonates than those of AGA neonates (p=0.014). A positive correlation was detected between cord blood and amniotic fluid sOB-R concentrations in the AGA group (AGA: r=0.492, p=0.028). We conclude that the main determinants of leptin in SGA and AGA newborns are different. We can state that birth weight and gender are the main determinants of leptin levels in healthy neonates, but factors other than birth weight and gender may contribute to leptin levels in SGA newborns.

AB  - Preeclampsia, a common complication of pregnancy, is associated with alteration in the concentration of leptin in maternal blood. The action of leptin is antagonistic to that of ghrelin. Here, we compared the levels of leptin and ghrelin in maternal serum and in arterial and venous cord blood between healthy pregnant women and those suffering from mild and severe preeclampsia. The levels of leptin in maternal and newborn's blood were elevated in both mild and severe preeclamptic patients (p < 0.05). Moreover, serum ghrelin levels were negatively correlated with blood pressure and leptin/ghrelin ratio was decreased in preeclampsia (p < 0.05). We concluded that increased production of ghrelin may represent a compensatory hypotensive mechanism in preeclamptic women.

AB  - Placenta development is an essential process for normal fetal growth and development, and healthy pregnancy maintenance. Inadequate placental development may cause clinical complications like diabetes, intrauterine growth retardation and preeclampsia. Due to limited data about placental expression of adiponectin, which has anti-diabetic effects, we studied the relationship between adiponectin and placental development in streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic and normal rats. We also investigated Adiponectin receptors and the downstream adiponectin molecules like peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, PPAR gamma, retinoic acid receptor (RXR)alpha in the development of the diabetic placenta to explain the effects of Adiponectin in detail. Diabetic rat placentas were found to be heavier than control placentas at the 18th and 20th gestational days, while diabetic embryos were lighter than control group at the 14th, 18th and 20th days of gestation. Adiponectin protein level decreased in diabetic placenta towards term. Moreover, maternal serum adiponectin levels were found to be significantly decreased in diabetic group. Adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) mRNA expression levels were similar between groups, while Adiponectin receptor 2 (AdipoR2) mRNA expression was significantly decreased at the 14th, 18th and 20th days of gestation in diabetic placentas. Additionally, the mRNA and protein expression of PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, and RXR alpha were found to be decreased in diabetic placentas. These observations show that diabetes and pregnancy is associated with adiponectin levels. In conclusion, our data reveals that adiponectin plays a role in improvement of placental development in diabetic conditions, in the investigated animal species.

AB  - Babies with intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) are at increased risk for experiencing negative neonatal outcomes due to their general developmental delay. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of a short postnatal leptin supply on the growth, structure, and functionality of several organs at weaning. IUGR piglets were injected from day 0 to day 5 with either 0.5 mg/kg/d leptin (IUGRLep) or saline (IUGRSal) and euthanized at day 21. Their organs were collected, weighed, and sampled for histological, biochemical, and immunohistochemical analyses. Leptin induced an increase in body weight and the relative weights of the liver, spleen, pancreas, kidneys, and small intestine without any changes in triglycerides, glucose and cholesterol levels. Notable structural and functional changes occurred in the ovaries, pancreas, and secondary lymphoid organs. The ovaries of IUGRLep piglets contained less oogonia but more oocytes enclosed in primordial and growing follicles than the ovaries of IUGRSal piglets, and FOXO3A staining grade was higher in the germ cells of IUGRLep piglets. Within the exocrine parenchyma of the pancreas, IUGRLep piglets presented a high rate of apoptotic cells associated with a higher trypsin activity. In the spleen and the Peyer's patches, B lymphocyte follicles were much larger in IUGRLep piglets than in IUGRSal piglets. Moreover, IUGRLep piglets showed numerous CD79(+) cells in well-differentiated follicle structures, suggesting a more mature immune system. This study highlights a new role for leptin in general developmental processes and may provide new insight into IUGR pathology.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in enzyme activities of erythrocyte superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and placental glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and analyze the levels of serum malondialdehyde (MDA), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), selenium (Se), leptin and placental MDA and glutathione (GSH)., STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional prospective study consisting of 32 preeclamptic (PE) pregnant, 25 non-pregnant (NP) women, 28 healthy pregnant (HP) women. Levels of lipid peroxides in serum and placenta, and activities of SOD, catalase in erythrocyte and placental GSH level, placental GSH-Px activity were measured by spectrophotometric methods. Serum levels of Cu, Zn, Se measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Serum levels of leptin was measured by enzyme immunoassay by using the Cayman chemical kit. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc Tukey-HSD test and Pearson correlation test were used for the statistical analyses., RESULTS: Serum levels of MDA, Cu, Leptin were markedly higher (P < 0.001); and serum level of Se was markedly lower (P < 0.001) in PE women compared with HP women and NP women. Also, placental MDA level was higher (P < 0.001) and placental GSH-Px activity was lower in PE women compared with HP women. In preeclamptic women erythrocyte catalase activity was markedly increased (P < 0.001), while erythrocyte SOD activity was markedly decreased (P < 0.001) compared to HP women and NP women. Placental GSH level was decreased compared to HP women (P < 0.001). Serum level of Zn was markedly decreased compared to NP women (P < 0.001) but no significant difference was observed in PE pregnant when compared with HP women (P > 0.05). Placental MDA level in PE women had significant negative correlation with serum Se level (r = -0.353, P < 0.05). A negative correlation was found between erythrocyte catalase activity with birth weight (r = -0.528, P < 0.001). Also, there were a significant negative correlation between serum levels of Cu and Se in the preeclamptic women (r = -0.407, P < 0.05)., CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that elevation of lipid peroxides together with impaired antioxidant defense mechanisms and status of trace metals and the presence of possible interrelationship and crosstalk between those parameters may be related at least partly to the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Additionally, lipid peroxides and blood oxidative imbalance could be part of the cytotoxic mechanisms leading to endothelial cell injury.

Methods: Seventeen men and women with SCI (mean age = 36.1 +/- 11.5 years) completed 6 months of supervised ABT consisting of load bearing, resistance training, locomotor training, and functional electrical stimulation. At baseline and after 3 and 6 months of ABT, body weight, body fat, and FFM were assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry, and fasting blood samples were obtained to assess changes in insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), adiponectin, and myostatin. Results: Across all subjects, there was no change (P > 0.05) in body weight, percent body fat, or FFM of the leg, arm, or trunk, whereas whole-body FFM declined (P = 0.02, 50.4 +/- 8.4 to 49.2 +/- 7.4 kg). No changes (P = 0.21-0.41) were demonstrated in IGF-I, adiponectin, or myostatin during the study. Conclusions: Chronic ABT focusing on the lower extremity does not slow muscle atrophy or alter body fat, body mass, or regional depots of FFM in persons with SCI. Further, it does not induce beneficial changes in adiponectin, myostatin, or IGF-I. Alternative exercise-based therapies are needed in SCI to reverse muscle atrophy and minimize the onset of related health risks.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Though the physiological roles of adipokines in metabolism, insulin resistance and satiety are clear, literature regarding associations between cord blood adipokine levels and childhood adiposity is equivocal., OBJECTIVES: To determine whether cord blood levels of leptin and adiponectin are associated with adiposity in children 2 to 5 years of age, and whether such associations are modified by sex., METHODS: Leptin and adiponectin levels were measured in cord blood and anthropometric measures were completed on 550 children enrolled in the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals Child Development Plus study (MIREC-CD Plus). We used multivariable linear and Poisson regression models to determine associations between cord blood adipokine levels and child body mass index (BMI), triceps and subscapular skinfold thickness and risk of overweight/obesity and to assess effect modification by child sex., RESULTS: Cord blood adiponectin was significantly associated with modest increases in BMI and the sum of triceps and subscapular skinfold z-scores in boys but not girls. A doubling of adiponectin levels was associated with a 30% increased risk of overweight/obesity in boys (RR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.64). Leptin was not associated with anthropometric measures in either sex., CONCLUSIONS: The observed associations between adiponectin and adiposity in boys were statistically significant, of moderate magnitude, and underscore the value of considering sex-specific patterns.

AB  - Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous, persistent chemicals that have been widely used in the production of common household and consumer goods for their nonflammable, lipophobic, and hydrophobic properties. Inverse associations between maternal or umbilical cord blood concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonate and birth weight have been identified. This literature has primarily examined each PFAS individually without consideration of the potential influence of correlated exposures. Further, the association between PFAS exposures and indicators of metabolic function (i.e., leptin and adiponectin) has received limited attention. We examined associations between first-trimester maternal plasma PFAS concentrations and birth weight and cord blood concentrations of leptin and adiponectin using data on 1,705 mother-infant pairs from the Maternal Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a trans-Canada birth cohort study that recruited women between 2008 and 2011. Bayesian hierarchical models were used to quantify associations and calculate credible intervals. Maternal perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight z score, though the null value was included in all credible intervals (log10 beta = -0.10, 95% credible interval: -0.34, 0.13). All associations between maternal PFAS concentrations and cord blood adipocytokine concentrations were of small magnitude and centered around the null value. Follow-up in a cohort of children is required to determine how the observed associations manifest in childhood.

AB  - Exposure to metals commonly found in the environment has been hypothesized to be associated with measures of fetal growth but the epidemiological literature is limited. The Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) study recruited 2001 women during the first trimester of pregnancy from 10 Canadian sites. Our objective was to assess the association between prenatal exposure to metals (lead, arsenic, cadmium, and mercury) and fetal metabolic function. Average maternal metal concentrations in 1st and 3rd trimester blood samples were used to represent prenatal metals exposure. Leptin and adiponectin were measured in 1363 cord blood samples and served as markers of fetal metabolic function. Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between metals and both high (>= 90%) and low (<= 10%) fetal adiponectin and leptin levels. Leptin levels were significantly higher in female infants compared to males. A significant relationship between maternal blood cadmium and odds of high leptin was observed among males but not females in adjusted models. When adjusting for birth weight z-score, lead was associated with an increased odd of high leptin. No other significant associations were found at the top or bottom 10th percentile in either leptin or adiponectin models. This study supports the proposition that maternal levels of cadmium influence cord blood adipokine levels in a sex-dependent manner. Further investigation is required to confirm these findings and to determine how such findings at birth will translate into childhood anthropometric measures. Copyright © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Obesity and type-2 diabetes are on the rise and in utero exposure to environmental contaminants is a suspected contributing factor. Our objective was to examine associations between prenatal exposure to potential endocrine disrupting chemicals and markers of fetal metabolic dysfunction., METHODS: The Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals Study (MIREC) recruited 2001 women during the first trimester of pregnancy from 10 Canadian sites. First trimester maternal urine was measured for 11 phthalate metabolites and bisphenol A (BPA). Leptin and adioponectin measured in 1,363 available umbilical cord blood samples served as markers of metabolic function. Restricted cubic spline curves were used to assess the relationship between continuous measures of phthalate and BPA levels and cord blood adipokines. Polytomous logistic regression models were used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association between phthalates and BPA and both high (>=90th percentile) and low (<=10th percentile) fetal adiponectin and leptin, adjusting for confounding factors. Analyses were conducted for all subjects, overall, and separately by fetal sex., RESULTS: Leptin was significantly higher in female than male infants. We observed an inverse, non-linear relationship between BPA and adiponectin among males in the restricted cubic spline and linear regression analysis. Mono-(3-carboxypropyl) (MCPP) was associated with increased odds of high leptin among males in the polytomous logistic regression models (4th quartile OR = 3.5 95% CI: 1.1-11.6)., CONCLUSION: Our findings contribute to the growing body of evidence examining the influence of early life exposure on metabolic regulation and function. Associations between maternal exposure to chemicals and markers of metabolic function appear to be potentially sex specific. However, further investigation is required to determine whether in utero and childhood exposure to BPA and phthalates are associated with metabolic dysfunctions later in life.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship of endothelin 1 (ET-1) and leptin concentrations in women and newborns following a pregnancy complicated with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)., METHODS: Twenty-five women with a pregnancy complicated with IUGR at 19 different gestational ages were matched with women with uncomplicated pregnancies. Blood samples from the umbilical artery and maternal peripheral venous circulation were collected at delivery, and ET-1 and leptin levels were determined from the blood samples. Data relating to obstetric complications (e.g., pregnancy-induced hypertension), delivery (e.g. mode, birth weight, signs of intrapartum fetal distress, and Apgar scores) were also recorded., RESULTS: Mean maternal ET-1 (13.4+/-6.2-9.9+/-2.9 pmol/l) and mean fetal ET-1 (14.5+/-4.2-11.7+/-3.1 pmol/l) concentrations were significantly higher when women had experienced pregnancies complicated with IUGR than when they had had normal pregnancies. Mean fetal leptin concentration was significantly lower in the study group (6.8+/-2.2 ng/ml) than in the control group (10.6+/-3.6 ng/ml (P<0.05). However, fetal leptin per kilogram of fetal weight was not significantly different in the study group (3.16+/-1.18 ng/ml) than in the control group (3.23+/-0.96 ng/ml) (P>0.05, paired t-test). However, a statistically significant correlation was observed between fetal leptin concentrations per kilogram of fetal weight and fetal endothelin concentrations in pregnancies complicated with IUGR (r=0.546; P<0.05)., CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest the intertwined roles of ET-1 and leptin in the pathophysiology of IUGR. Further studies concerning interaction between these peptides in different pregnancy conditions may provide important information about the actions of ET-1 and leptin on fetal growth.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maternal obesity (MO) is associated with a higher risk of immune-mediated diseases in the offspring and higher leptin levels in cord blood (CB). This study evaluates the number and function of lymphocyte subtypes in CB related to MO and its relationship with leptin concentration and leptin receptor expression., METHODS: Pregnant women with (n = 32) or without obesity (n = 41) were enrolled at delivery. Cord blood mononuclear cells were separated with Ficoll-Hypaque. B and CD4+, regulatory and effector T cells were quantified by Flow Cytometry. Cord blood leptin concentration was measured by ELISA, and the leptin receptor (sLepR) on Treg cells was determined by Flow Cytometry., RESULTS: MO was associated with higher numbers of CD4+, Treg and effector T cells in the CB of their offspring, without differences in the suppressive function of Tregs. Female offspring had a higher number of these cells and a higher cord leptin concentration. Tregs expressed higher levels of sLepR than effector T cells, without differences between groups., CONCLUSIONS: MO is associated with changes in the newborn's immune profile, more evident in female newborns with higher leptin concentrations. More studies are needed to identify the mechanisms by which the high levels of cord leptin in the newborn of women with obesity could affect the offspring's immune system.

AB  - Maternal pregestational obesity is a well-known risk factor for offspring obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. The mechanisms by which maternal obesity can induce alterations in fetal and later neonatal metabolism are not fully elucidated due to its complexity and multifactorial causes. Two adipokines, leptin and adiponectin, are involved in fetal and postnatal growth trajectories, and both are altered in women with pregestational obesity. The placenta synthesizes leptin, which goes mainly to the maternal circulation and in lesser amount to the developing fetus. Maternal pregestational obesity and hyperleptinemia are associated with placental dysfunction and changes in nutrient transporters which directly affect fetal growth and development. By the other side, the embryo can produce its own leptin from early in development, which is associated to fetal weight and adiposity. Adiponectin, an insulin-sensitizing adipokine, is downregulated in maternal obesity. High molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin is the most abundant form and with most biological actions. In maternal obesity lower total and HMW adiponectin levels have been described in the mother, paralleled with high levels in the umbilical cord. Several studies have found that cord blood adiponectin levels are related with postnatal growth trajectories, and it has been suggested that low adiponectin levels in women with pregestational obesity enhance placental insulin sensitivity and activation of placental amino acid transport systems, supporting fetal overgrowth. The possible mechanisms by which maternal pregestational obesity, focusing in the actions of leptin and adiponectin, affects the fetal development and postnatal growth trajectories in their offspring are discussed.

AB  - AIMS: To study the effect of in-utero alcohol exposure on the insulin-like growth factor axis (IGF) and leptin during infancy and childhood, considering that exposed children may exhibit pre- and postnatal growth retardation., METHODS: We prospectively identified heavily drinking pregnant women who consumed on average 4 or more drinks of ethanol per day (>= 48 g/day) and assessed growth in 69 of their offspring and an unexposed control group of 83 children, measuring serum IGF-I (radioimmunoassay), IGF-II (immunoradiometric assay, IRMA), insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) (IRMA) and leptin (IRMA) at 1 month and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 years of age., RESULTS: IGF-II levels increased with age in both groups, but the rate of increase was significantly higher in exposed children, and levels were significantly higher in ethanol-exposed children at 3, 4, and 5 years of age. In exposed children, IGF-I levels were higher at 3 and 4 years and leptin levels were significantly lower at 1 and 2 years. Exposed subjects showed a much lower correlation between IGF-I and growth parameters than unexposed subjects., CONCLUSION: Exposure to ethanol during pregnancy increases IGF-I and IGF-II and decreases leptin during early childhood. The increase in serum IGF-II concentrations in ethanol-exposed children suggests that this hormone should be explored as a potential marker for prenatal alcohol exposure. Copyright © 2010 S.

AB  - Background: Adiposity measured in mid-or late-life and estimated using anthropometric measures such as body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or metabolic markers such as blood leptin and adiponectin levels, is associated with late-onset dementia risk. However, during later life, this association may reverse and aging- and dementia-related processes may differentially affect adiposity measures. Objective: We explored associations of concurrent BMI, WHR, and blood leptin and high molecular weight adiponectin levels with dementia occurrence. Methods: 924 Swedish community-dwelling elderly without dementia, aged 70 years and older, systematically-sampled by birth day and birth year population-based in the Gothenburg city region of Sweden. The Gothenburg Birth Cohort Studies are designed for evaluating risk and protective factors for dementia. All dementias diagnosed after age 70 for 10 years were identified. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to predict dementia occurrence between 2000-2005, 2005-2010, and 2000-2010 after excluding prevalent baseline (year 2000) dementias. Baseline levels of BMI, WHR, leptin, and adiponectin were used. Results: Within 5 years of baseline, low BMI (<20 kg/m(2)) was associated with higher odds of dementia compared to those in the healthy BMI category (>= 20-24.9 kg/m(2)). Compared to the lowest quartile, leptin levels in the second quartile were associated with lower odds of dementia in women (p < 0.05). Conclusion: In late-life, anthropometric and metabolic adiposity measures appear to be differentially associated with dementia risk. While BMI and leptin levels are highly positively correlated, our results show that their association with dementia at age >= 70 years, is asynchronous. These data suggest that with aging, the complexity of the adiposity exposure may increase and suggests metabolic dysregulation. Additional studies are needed to better understand this complexity.

AB  - Objective. To compare lipocalin-2 (LCN2) levels in pre-eclamptic women with those in healthy pregnant women, and to determine whether there is a correlation between LCN2 levels and the severity of the disease. Methods. The study included 66 pregnant women: 22 healthy pregnant women (Group 1), 23 women with mild pre-eclampsia (Group 2), and 21 women with severe pre-eclampsia (Group 3). Pre-eclamptic women and normal controls were carefully matched for maternal age, gestational age, and body mass index (BMI). The maternal levels of plasma LCN2 were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Results. Plasma LCN2 levels in the pre-eclamptic group were significantly lower than those in the healthy control group (p < 0.05). Although plasma LCN2 level was lower in the severe compared to the mild pre-eclamptic group, the difference was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). There was no significant correlation between LCN2 levels and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BMI, triglyceride, gestational week at delivery, birth weight, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in pre-eclamptic and healthy pregnant women (p > 0.05). Conclusions. Our results show that there are decreased concentrations of plasma LCN2 in pre-eclamptic subjects and this may indicate that LCN2 plays a role in the pathogenesis of pre-eclampsia. However, further experiments are needed to clarify this role.

AB  - Testosterone induces intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) with maternal glucose dysregulation and oxidant release in various tissues. Adiponectin, which modulates the antioxidant nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling is expressed in the placenta and affects fetal growth. Sildenafil, a phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5i), used mainly in erectile dysfunction has been widely studied as a plausible pharmacologic candidate in IUGR. Therefore, the present study sought to determine the effect of PDE5i on placental adiponectin/Nrf2 pathway in gestational testosterone-induced impaired glucose tolerance and fetal growth. Fifteen pregnant Wistar rats were allotted into three groups (n = 5/group) receiving vehicles (Ctr; distilled water and olive oil), testosterone propionate (Tes; 3.0 mg/kg; sc) or combination of testosterone propionate (3.0 mg/kg; sc) and sildenafil (50.0 mg/kg; po) from gestational day 14-19. On gestational day 20, plasma and placenta homogenates were obtained for biochemical analysis as well as fetal biometry. Pregnant rats exposed to testosterone had 4-fold increase in circulating testosterone compared with control (20.9 +/- 2.8 vs 5.1 +/- 1.7 ng/mL; p < 0.05) whereas placenta testosterone levels were similar in testosterone- and vehicle-treated rats. Exposure to gestational testosterone caused reduction in fetal and placental weights, placental Nrf2 and adiponectin. Moreover, impaired glucose tolerance, elevated plasma triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, placental triglyceride, total cholesterol, lactate, malondialdehyde and alanine aminotransferase were observed in testosterone-exposed rats. Treatment with sildenafil improved glucose tolerance, plasma TyG index, fetal and placental weights and reversed placental adiponectin in testosterone-exposed pregnant rats without any effect on placental Nrf2. Therefore, in testosterone-exposed rats, sildenafil improves impaired glucose tolerance, poor fetal outcome which is accompanied by augmented placental adiponectin regardless of depressed Nrf2.

AB  - Leptin and hypothalamic-adipose lipid handling are relevant in determining the shift of metabolic activities. There are scanty findings connecting glucose dysregulation as a result of hyperandrogenism during gestation to hypothalamic-adipose axis and leptin resistance. Sildenafil has recently gained attention in the prevention of intra-uterine growth restriction. The present study aimed at demonstrating the effect of sildenafil on leptin resistance and hypothalamic-adipose lipid handling in testosterone-exposed pregnant rats. Three groups of pregnant Wistar rats (n = 5/group) received olive oil (Ctr, S.C.) or testosterone propionate (Tes, 3.0 mg/kg; sc)or testosterone propionate (3.0 mg/kg; sc) and sildenafil (Tes + PDE5, 50 mg/kg; po)from gestational day 14-19. Blood samples, hypothalamus and adipose tissue were excised for biochemical analysis on day 20. Adipose and body weights, plasma leptin and adiponectin, adipose and hypothalamic leptin and triglyceride, adipose uric acid, hypothalamic Nrf2, catalase and nitric oxide were reduced following gestational testosterone exposure. Also, fasting insulin, plasma triglyceride, uric acid, leptin-adiponectin ratio, hypothalamic free fatty acid, total cholesterol, uric acid, aspartate transaminase and cyclic guanine monophosphate were elevated by testosterone exposure to pregnant animals. Sildenafil ameliorated leptin resistance and normalized hypothalamic-adipose lipid handling. Therefore, sildenafil protects against testosterone-induced leptin resistance and adverse hypothalamic-adipose lipid handling in pregnant rats. Copyright © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objectives were to evaluate the relation between fetal anthropometric parameters and cord blood concentration of adiponectin and high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Subjects and methods: A total of 104 pregnant women (52 with gestational diabetes mellitus [GDM], 52 with normal glucose tolerance (NGT) participated. Venous cord blood samples were obtained at delivery, centrifuged and the plasma was stored at -20degreeC. The samples were assessed for adiponectin and hs-CRP using the ELISA method. Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software., RESULTS: The adiponectin concentration was higher in the GDM group than in the NGT group (11.05 +/- 4.1 microg/mL in GDM vs. 5.34 +/- 2.63 microg/mL in NGT, p < 0.001). GDM was also higher in neonates delivered at later gestational ages (p < 0.001, Pearson correlation = 0.59). There was a positive correlation between cord blood adiponectin and birth weight in the GDM group (p < 0.001, Pearson correlation = 0.619) but not in the NGT group. There was no significant correlation between adiponectin and infant length or head circumference. There was also no significant difference in cord blood hs-CRP concentration between groups. No relation was found between hs-CRP and newborn anthropometric parameters., CONCLUSION: In the GDM group, adiponectin concentration was considerably higher and had a positive correlation with the ponderal index and birth weight which was not found in the NGT group.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) plays important roles in the central regulation of food intake and body weight control. However, little is known about the role of BDNF in childhood obesity., OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between plasma levels of BDNF and anthropometric factors, metabolic derangements due to obesity, adipocytokine levels and birth weight in obese Japanese children., SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six obese Japanese children aged from 5 to 15 years old were enrolled. The age-matched control group consisted of 32 non-obese healthy children. The plasma levels of BDNF and adipocytokines (leptin and adiponectin) were assayed using ELISA techniques., RESULTS: The mean BMI Z-scores were -0.67, +2.15 and +3.39 for the non-obese control children, obese (BMI >= 90th percentile, <99th percentile) and morbidly obese (BMI >= 99th percentile), respectively. The plasma levels of BDNF were significantly decreased in the morbidly obese children compared with the levels in the obese and non-obese control children (507 +/- 33 pg/ml vs. 626 +/- 46 pg/ml, 621 +/- 35 pg/ml, p < 0.05). Univariate linear regression analysis showed that the plasma level of BDNF was positively correlated with birth weight (r = 0.264, p < 0.05) and inversely correlated with the BMI Z-score (r = -0.314, p < 0.05). Multivariate forward stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that the birth weight and BMI Z-score are independent predictors of the plasma BDNF level., CONCLUSION: The plasma level of BDNF, which is decreased in morbidly obese children, is associated with birth weight and the BMI Z-score. Our results suggest that BDNF may play important roles in the development and pathophysiology of childhood obesity. Copyright A© 2014 Asian Oceanian Association for the Study of Obesity .

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many factors are affecting intrauterine growth. The role of Wingless-type (Wnt) inducible signaling pathway protein-1 (WISP1), a novel adipokine and placental proteoglycans in intrauterine growth, is not known. We aimed to measure umbilical cord blood levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, WISP1, and placental proteoglycans [glypican-1 (GPC1), glypican-3 (GPC3), and syndecan-1 (SDC1)] which are thought to have an important role in fetal growth and investigate their relation with birth weight., METHODS: Full-term neonates were included in this prospective, cross-sectional study and classified as appropriate for gestational age (AGA), small for gestational age (SGA), and large for gestational age (LGA) according to their birth weight. Umbilical cord blood levels of glucose, insulin, leptin, WISP1, GPC1, GPC3, and SDC1 were measured., RESULTS: Leptin levels were higher in LGA newborns compared to AGA and SGA newborns, while WISP1, GPC1, GPC3, and SDC1 levels were not different between the three groups. Leptin and GPC1 levels were higher in infants of mothers with gestational diabetes mellitus compared to infants of non-diabetic mothers, while WISP1, GPC3, and SDC1 were not different between the groups. Leptin was positively correlated with insulin, birth weight, and maternal weight. While there was a strong correlation between the WISP1, GPC1, GPC3, and SDC1 levels; there was no correlation between the birth weight, maternal weight, glucose, insulin, and WISP1, GPC1, GPC3, and SDC1 levels., CONCLUSION: Umbilical cord blood levels of GPC1, GPC3, SDC1, and WISP1 were not different between SGA, AGA, and LGA infants. The significance of serum levels of these adipokines and proteoglycans remains to be elucidated.

AB  - Objective: In small for gestational age (SGA) children, catch-up growth could be influenced by methylation of several genes involved in metabolism. Epigenetics may influence the development of metabolic diseases in adulthood. To compare the methylation of leptin (LEP), glucagon-like peptide-2 receptor (GLP2R), insulin receptor substrate-2 (IRS2) in SGA patients with and without catch-up growth., Methods: Observational prospective study of SGA children. Demographical and clinical variables were collected from clinical records and parents' questionnaire. Methylation status of LEP, IRS2, and GLP2R promoters was evaluated in DNA extracted from patient and one parent saliva samples., Results: Forty-eight SGA patients were included. Twenty-six (54.2%) had catch-up growth phenotype and 22 (45.8%) did not. The median age was 5.2 years [RIC 4.1-6.8] without difference between groups (p=0.306). The catch-up group had increased appetite (42.3% vs 9.1%, p=0.008), family history of dyslipidemia (42.3% vs 27.3%) and diabetes (34.6% vs 22.7%) compared to non-catch-up group. Catch-up patients had significantly larger waist circumference compared to non-catch-up group (median 55 cm [RIC 52-58] versus median 49.5 cm [RIC46-52]; p<0.001). LEP and GLP2R were methylated in all samples. IRS2 was methylated in 60% of SGA patients without difference between groups (p=0.520)., Conclusion: There is no association between IRS2 methylation and catch-up growth among SGA patients. LEP and GLP2R were methylated in all SGA patients. Gene methylation may be implicated in metabolic disease later in life. More studies should be performed to confirm this hypothesis.

AB  - Introduction: Hypertensive Disorders of Pregnancy (HDP) is a multi-systemic disorder of pregnancy, complicating 2-8% of pregnancies and contributes to considerable maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. Alterations in maternal and cord blood adipokine levels in HDP remain unclear. Aim and Objective: To assess the alteration of maternal and fetal adipokine levels in normal pregnancy and HDP and correlate with clinical characteristics. Material(s) and Method(s): Maternal and umbilical cord blood samples and clinical details were collected from 25 healthy pregnant women, 25 Gestational Hypertension (GHTN) and 25 preeclamptic (PE) women. Maternal and umbilical cord blood levels of Adiponectin, Resistin and Leptin levels were estimated by ELISA. Result(s): Maternal and Umbilical cord Adiponectin levels and Umbilical cord resistin levels were significantly elevated in Preeclampsia group than Control and GHTN group. No significant differences were observed in the maternal resistin, leptin and umbilical cord leptin levels. Gestational age at the time of delivery (GA) and Birth weight of baby were significantly lower in preeclampsia group than control and GHTN group. BMI were significantly elevated in GHTN group than control group. Maternal and cord blood Adiponectin levels were positively correlated with severity of proteinuria, Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure and negatively correlated with age, GA. Cord blood Resistin levels were positively correlated with GA and Birth weight of baby and negatively correlated with Systolic blood pressure and severity of proteinuria. Conclusion(s): Increase in Maternal and Umbilical cord blood Adiponectin levels and decrease in Umbilical cord blood resistin levels could be part ofa physiological feedback mechanism improving insulin sensitivity of Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy.

AB  - Background Infant adiposity is linked to both high maternal fat mass (FM) and excessive gestational FM gain, whereas the association with maternal adipokines is less clear. The aim was to determine how levels of maternal leptin, the soluble leptin receptor (sOB-R), adiponectin, and FM during pregnancy were linked to infant FM in normal-weight (NW) women and women with obesity (OB). Methods Body composition and serum levels of leptin, adiponectin, and sOB-R were determined three times during pregnancy in 80 NW and 46 OB women. For infants, body composition was measured at 1 and 12 weeks of age. Results Maternal leptin and sOB-R levels increased during pregnancy. For NW women, infant FM at 1 week was inversely associated with changes in maternal leptin and at 12 weeks inversely associated with absolute maternal sOB-R levels throughout pregnancy, as well as changes in sOB-R levels in early pregnancy. For OB women, infant FM at both 1 and 12 weeks were best explained by maternal FM. Conclusions Leptin and sOB-R, thought to regulate leptin bioavailability, are associated with fat accumulation in infants born to NW women. In OB women, maternal FM in early pregnancy is more important than leptin in determining infant fat accumulation. Impact In normal-weight women, the regulation of maternal leptin bioavailability during pregnancy has a role in infant fat mass accumulation. In women with obesity, however, pre-pregnancy maternal fat mass seems more important for infant fat mass. This is the first study of maternal adipokines and fat mass including longitudinal measurements in both mothers and their children. Understanding the relationship between maternal factors and infant fat mass is of great importance as obesity is programmed over the generations, and it is important to learn what regulates this programming.

AB  - CONTEXT: The metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of metabolic abnormalities that increase the risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus and vascular disease. The common characteristics of MetS and hypercortisolemic conditions such as Cushing's syndrome (CS) suggest that the pathogenesis of MetS and central obesity might involve prolonged and excessive exposure to glucocorticoids. The present review summarizes the evidence on the potential role of cortisol in the pathogenesis of MetS and discusses new therapeutic approaches for these patients., EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: Using PubMed, we searched for publications during the last 20 yr regarding the possible pathogenetic role of cortisol in the development of MetS., EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: Emerging data suggest that patients with MetS show hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which leads to a state of "functional hypercortisolism." The cause for this activation of the HPA axis remains uncertain but may be partly associated with chronic stress and/or low birth weight, which are both associated with increased circulating cortisol levels and greater responsiveness of the HPA axis. Increased exposure to cortisol contributes to increased fat accumulation in visceral depots. However, cortisol metabolism is not only centrally regulated. The action of 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 at the tissue level also modulates cortisol metabolism. Increased 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-1 activity in adipose tissue and liver might contribute to the development of several features of the MetS., CONCLUSIONS: MetS shares many characteristics of CS, and cortisol might play a role in the development of MetS at both a central and a peripheral level.

AB  - Adiponectin plays an important role in energy homeostasis and metabolism in mammalian adipose tissue. In this study, the relationship between adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) haplotypes and variation in growth and carcass traits in New Zealand (NZ) Romney lambs was investigated using General Linear Models (GLMs). Eight haplotypes were found in these lambs and they were composed of the four previously reported promoter fragment sequences (A1-D1) and three previously reported intron 2-exon 3 sequences (A3-C3). The frequencies of the haplotypes ranged from 0.07% to 45.91%. The presence of A1-A3 was associated with a decreased pre-weaning growth rate (p = 0.037), and decreased leg lean-meat yield (p = 0.001), loin lean-meat yield (p = 0.018) and total lean-meat yield (p = 0.004). The presence of A1-C3 was associated with increased carcass fat depth over the 12th rib (V-GR; p = 0.001) and a decreased proportion of loin lean-meat yield (p = 0.045). The presence of B1-A3 was associated with an increased proportion of leg lean-meat yield (p = 0.016) and proportion of shoulder lean-meat yield (p = 0.030). No associations were found with birth weight, tailing weight and weaning weight. These results suggest that ovine ADIPOQ may have value as a genetic marker for NZ Romney sheep breeding.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors that determine the response to Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination in urban environments with respect to socioeconomic status (SES), prenatal exposure to infections or newborn's nutritional status., METHODS: The study was conducted in an urban area, in Makassar, Indonesia. At baseline, 100 mother and newborns pair from high and low SES communities were included. Intestinal protozoa, soil transmitted helminths, total IgE, anti-Hepatitis A Virus IgG and anti-Toxoplasma IgG were measured to determine exposure to infections. Information on gestational age, birth weight/height and delivery status were collected. Weight-for-length z-score, a proxy for newborns adiposity, was calculated. Leptin and adiponectin from cord sera were also measured. At 10 months of age, BCG scar size was measured from 59 infants. Statistical modelling was performed using multiple linear regression., RESULTS: Both SES and birth nutritional status shape the response towards BCG vaccination at 10 months of age. Infants born to low SES families have smaller BCG scar size compared to infants born from high SES families and total IgE contributed to the reduced scar size. On the other hand, infants born with better nutritional status were found to have bigger BCG scar size but this association was abolished by leptin levels at birth., CONCLUSION: This study provides new insights into the importance of SES and leptin levels at birth on the development of BCG scar in 10 months old infants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Improved glycaemic control during pregnancy in mothers with type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and gestational diabetes (GDM) has resulted in a marked reduction of perinatal mortality and morbidity, but the prevalence of macrosomia is usually high., OBJECTIVE: We used non-invasive anthropometric methods to estimate the body composition and the thickness of the interventricular heart septum in 18 infants of mothers with well-controlled T1DM, 10 infants of mothers with GDM and 28 infants of healthy control mothers matched for gestational age and mode of delivery., METHODS: Skinfold measurements were obtained with a Harpenden calliper within 48 h after delivery. Echocardiography was also performed to measure the thickness of the interventricular septum. Cord blood was sampled for assays of C-peptide, leptin and IGF-I., RESULTS: The rates of macrosomia (gestational age-adjusted birth weight >2 standard deviation score, SDS) were 56 and 30% in infants of mothers with T1DM and GDM, respectively, compared to 10% in control infants. The body fat content was 40% (0.2 kg) higher and the interventricular heart septum thickness was increased by 20% in both groups of infants of diabetic mothers. We found no associations between maternal levels of HbA1c during pregnancy and body composition or interventricular heart septum thickness. Cord levels of C-peptide and leptin were significantly higher in infants of T1DM mothers than in control infants. Cord leptin level was associated with birth weight SDS and percent body fat in infants of T1DM mothers. IGF-I was associated with percent body fat in infants of GDM mothers and control mothers. A multiple-regression analysis showed that 50% of the variation in body weight SDS could be determined, with IGF-I, leptin and C-peptide as independent variables., CONCLUSION: Both fat mass and cardiac septal thickness are increased in newborn infants of women with T1DM and GDM in spite of efforts to achieve good glycaemic control during pregnancy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies correlate low birth weight and the subsequent development of diabetes mellitus (DM). Early changes in insulin resistance in infants with catch-up growth (CUG) have not been evaluated in our population., AIM: To identify dietary and metabolic features associated with CUG in infants born small for gestational age (SGA) at 1 year old., METHODS: In a cohort study of 88 term infants (44 SGA and 44 appropriate for gestational age [AGA]), breastfeeding and weaning age were registered. Anthropometric measurements, glucose, insulin, and leptin concentrations were measured at birth and at 1 year old., RESULTS: A history of DM in a second-degree relative (p = 0.01) and complementary breastfeeding (p = 0.0003) were higher in SGA compared to AGA infants. Ten (13.6%) infants showed CUG in length and weight combined. They had lower weight, glucose, IR index, and leptin concentrations at birth than those without CUG. After logistic regression analysis for factors related to weight CUG, gender, weaning age, birth weight and leptin concentration at birth were included in the model (R2 = 0.31; p = 0.00004)., CONCLUSIONS: Female gender, early weaning, lower birth weight, and lower leptin concentration at birth are related to weight CUG in Mexican infants.

AB  - CONTEXT: Prenatal growth restriction may affect future fertility in both females and males. Studies have shown that growth-retarded male rats have different sexual behavior and disturbed steroidogenesis., OBJECTIVE: We hypothesized that adult human males born small for gestational age (SGA) have an altered sex hormone profile., DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: Twenty-five adult males born SGA with median birth weight -2.2 sd scores (SDS) and birth length -2.4 SDS were studied. Median age was 23.1 yr and final height -0.5 SDS. They were compared with 44 male controls with median age 20.5 yr and final height 0.4 SDS., MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome before the study started was 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) levels in SGA males., RESULTS: The SGA group showed significantly higher median levels of E(2), 17.9 pg/ml (P < 0.001), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT), 0.543 ng/ml (P < 0.05), compared with controls, 12.6 pg/ml and 0.423 ng/ml, respectively. Testosterone (T) levels did not differ between groups. E(2) to T ratio correlated negatively to birth weight (r = -0.40, P < 0.01) and birth length (r = -0.44, P < 0.001). DHT to T ratio correlated negatively to birth weight (r = -0.51, P < 0.001) and birth length (r = -0.38, P < 0.01). Males born SGA also had significantly higher median levels of inhibin B, 164 pg/ml (P < 0.05), compared with controls, 137 pg/ml. Inhibin B correlated negatively to birth length (r = -0.34, P < 0.01)., CONCLUSION: SGA males of normal stature have higher levels of E(2), DHT, and inhibin B than controls, indicating a disturbed steroid synthesis or metabolism. Aromatase activity, calculated as E(2) to T ratio, and 5alpha-reductase activity, calculated as DHT to T ratio, is negatively correlated to size at birth.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Leptin signaling in placentas of obese women may influence fetal growth and may be dependent on fetal sex. The aim of this study was to investigate placental gene expression of leptin, its receptor and inflammatory cytokines in obese mothers in relation to offspring birth weight and sex., METHODS: In total, 109 placental tissue samples from severely obese women (body mass index in first trimester >=35 kg/m2) giving birth vaginally at term to a healthy child were included. Quantitative real-time PCR was used for the analysis of leptin (LEP), its receptor LEPR with two splice variants, interleukin (IL)1B, chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 8 (CXCL8), tumour necrosis factor (TNF), IL6, IL10, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) and insulin receptor (INSR). The subjects were divided into three groups based on LEP expression percentiles (<25th percentile; 25-75th percentile and >75th percentile)., RESULTS: A reverse U-shaped association between LEP expression and birth weight z-scores was found (R2 = 0.075, p = 0.005). Placental LEPRb expression was downregulated (p = 0.034) in those with highest LEP expression. Female infants had higher birth weight z-scores than males (0.58 (-1.49-2.88) vs 0.21 (-1.50-2.93), p = 0.020) and their placental LEPRb expression was upregulated (p = 0.047). The associations between expression of different genes differed by sex., DISCUSSION: A reverse U-shaped relationship between placental LEP expression and offspring birth weight z-scores was found together with sexual dimorphism in LEPRb expression indicating a complex regulation of fetal growth by placental leptin signaling in maternal obesity.

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to investigate placental ghrelin and leptin expression as well as cord blood ghrelin and adiponectin levels in maternal obesity and associations between placental ghrelin expression, cord blood ghrelin levels and maternal and infant variables., MATERIALS AND METHODS: Placental ghrelin and leptin expression were analyzed by RT-PCR in 32 severely obese and 32 matched normal-weight women. Cord blood ghrelin, adiponectin, leptin, and C-peptide concentrations were analyzed by ELISA., RESULTS: Neither ghrelin nor leptin expression and neither cord blood ghrelin nor adiponectin levels differed between the groups. Placental ghrelin expression was associated with BMI at delivery in the obese women (r = 0.424, p = .016) and in the infants born to normal-weight women with their weight z-scores at six (r = -0.642, p = .010), nine (r = -0.441, p = .015), and 12 months of age (r = -0.402, p = .028)., CONCLUSIONS: Placental ghrelin and leptin expression as well as cord blood ghrelin and adiponectin levels do not seem to be altered in severe maternal obesity. Placenta-derived ghrelin may influence the infants' postnatal weight gain, but possibly only when the mother has normal weight.

AB  - Leptin is an adipokine that acts in the central nervous system and regulates energy balance. Animal models and human observational studies have suggested that leptin surge in the perinatal period has a critical role in programming long-term risk of obesity. In utero exposure to maternal hyperglycemia has been associated with increased risk of obesity later in life. Epigenetic mechanisms are suspected to be involved in fetal programming of long term metabolic diseases. We investigated whether DNA methylation levels near LEP locus mediate the relation between maternal glycemia and neonatal leptin levels using the 2-step epigenetic Mendelian randomization approach. We used data and samples from up to 485 mother-child dyads from Gen3G, a large prospective population-based cohort. First, we built a genetic risk score to capture maternal glycemia based on 10 known glycemic genetic variants (GRS10) and showed it was an adequate instrumental variable (beta = 0.046 mmol/L of maternal fasting glucose per additional risk allele; SE = 0.007; P = 7.8 x 10(-11); N = 467). A higher GRS10 was associated with lower methylation levels at cg12083122 located near LEP (beta = -0.072 unit per additional risk allele; SE = 0.04; P = 0.05; N = 166). Direction and effect size of association between the instrumental variable GRS10 and methylation at cg12083122 were consistent with the negative association we observed using measured maternal glycemia. Lower DNA methylation levels at cg12083122 were associated with higher cord blood leptin levels (beta = -0.17 log of cord blood leptin per unit; SE = 0.07; P = 0.01; N = 170). Our study supports that maternal glycemia is part of causal pathways influencing offspring leptin epigenetic regulation.

AB  - Resistin is one of the most important adipocytokines in mammalian cells due to its involvement in insulin resistance, obesity, and autoimmune diseases. Resistin is encoded by RETN gene that is primarily expressed in adipose tissues. Mutations in this gene have been associated with several productive traits in animals. This study was conducted to assess the possible biomarker capacity of RETN by evaluating its association with growth traits in two economically important sheep in the Middle East. Genotyping was conducted using PCR-single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP), and the polymorphism of RETN was associated with several growth traits for three months intervals starting from birth until one year of age. In a total of 190 Karakul sheep and 245 Awassi sheep, only one SNP (233A > C) was detected in the RETN gene. The identified novel SNP showed significant associations with all growth traits at the ages of six, nine, and twelve months. At the age of six months onward, lambs with AC and CC genotypes showed respectively lower body weight and length, chest and abdominal circumferences, and wither and rump heights than those with AA genotype. Due to the remarkable association between RETN;233A > C and lower growth traits, this genotype is suggested as a promising marker to assess growth traits in Karakul and Awassi sheep. This is the first study that demonstrated the importance of RETN as a possible tool for evaluating growth traits in two breeds of sheep with a possibility to be applied to other breeds via large-scale association analysis.

AB  - The IGF system has an important role in growth and development. IGF-II is a recognized fetal growth promoter. However, its physiological postnatal role remains uncertain, although it is maintained in the circulation at a substantially high level throughout life. IGF-II has been strongly linked to obesity in genetic studies, and more recent evidence suggests a metabolic role. We examined fat depot differences in IGF-II action on differentiation and metabolism. We speculate a specific effect on visceral adipocytes in relation to the differential distribution of insulin receptors between visceral and subcutaneous fat depots. We used a previously established adipocyte, cell culture system of matched pairs of visceral and subcutaneous fat biopsies from 20 normal weight children undergoing routine surgery for nonmalignant. nonseptic conditions. Preadipocytes were differentiated for 14 days in the presence or absence of IGF-II. Oil Red O staining. Western blotting, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction techniques were employed to assess levels of adipogenesis markers and levels of the insulin receptor and insulin receptor isoforms. Our data indicate that IGF-II promotes preadipocyte differentiation in subcutaneous preadipocytes but showed a protective, opposing effect restricting visceral preadipocyte differentiation, confirmed by reductions in the differentiation markers peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma and adiponectin and in triglyceride staining. Additionally. IGF-II reduced mRNA expression of the insulin receptor in adipocytes and down-regulated insulin receptor isoform A and glucose transporter 4 abun- dance and corresponding glucose uptake in visceral adipocytes. In conclusion, IGF-II is a regulator of preadipocyte differentiation and metabolism by acting as a differential modulator of fat accumulation favoring less visceral fat deposition in children.

AB  - Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a heterogeneous syndrome, with long-term sequelae from birth to senescence. The long-term effects of PCOS are attributed to several metabolic aberrations ensuing the syndrome. In a systematic review of literature regarding the cardiovascular risk factors that accompany PCOS, we found that macrovascular function has been assessed by flow-mediated dilatation (FMD), microvascular function by venous occlusion plethysmography (VOP), and arterial structure by ultrasonographic assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT) usually of the carotid artery. Contradictory results have been reported; however, in most studies, endothelial dysfunction, an early marker of atherosclerosis assessed either by haemodynamic methods such as FMD or by biochemical methods such as endothelin-1 levels, was found to be impaired. VOP is a less-studied method, with few indices altered. IMT was found to be altered in most of the included studies, but the population was more heterogeneous. Inflammatory markers, including C-reactive protein, were also found to be altered in most studies. On the other hand, a number of interventions have been shown beneficial for the markers of cardiovascular risk, in the context of insulin-sensitizers. However, other interventions such as oral contraceptive pills or statins did not consistently show a similar beneficial effect. In summary, the early identification and eventual treatment of cardiovascular clinical and biochemical risk factors may be used in clinical practice to prevent potential 'silent' triggers of cardiovascular disease.Copyright © Touch Medical Media 2021

AB  - Events during early life can affect reproductive and metabolic functions in adulthood. We evaluated the programming effects of a single early postnatal estradiol injection (within 3 h after birth) in female rats. We assessed ovarian and parametrial adipose tissue morphology, evaluated gene expression related to follicular development and adipose tissue metabolism, and developed a non-invasive volumetric estimation of parametrial adipose tissue by magnetic resonance imaging. Estradiol reduced ovarian weight, increased antral follicle size and number of atretic antral follicles, and decreased theca interna thickness in atretic antral follicles. Adult estradiol-injected rats also had malformed vaginal openings and lacked corpora lutea, confirming anovulation. Estradiol markedly reduced parametrial adipose tissue mass. Adipocyte size was unchanged, suggesting reduced adipocyte number. Parametrial adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase activity was increased. In ovaries, estradiol increased mRNA expression of adiponectin, complement component 3, estrogen receptor a, and glucose transporter 3 and 4; in parametrial adipose tissue, expression of complement component 3 was increased, expression of estrogen receptor a was decreased, and expression of leptin, lipoprotein lipase, and hormone-sensitive lipase was unaffected. These findings suggest that early postnatal estradiol exposure of female rats result in long-lasting effects on the ovary and parametrial adipose tissue at adult age. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Studies suggest that prenatal exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) may contribute to childhood obesity. While exact mechanisms for this association are unknown, circulating adipokines are hypothesized to contribute to early-life weight gain., METHODS: The Maternal and Child Health Study birth cohort included 136 women from the Los Angeles County + University of Southern California Medical Center. This study estimated prenatal residential TRAP exposure and used linear regression analysis to examine associations between adipokines with TRAP exposure and infant weight change (birth to 6 months)., RESULTS: A one standard deviation (1-SD: 2 ppb) increase in prenatal non-freeway nitrogen oxides was associated with 33% (P = 0.01) higher leptin and 9% higher high molecular weight adiponectin levels (P = 0.07) in cord blood. Leptin levels were 71% higher in mothers who lived <75 m than those living >300 m from major roadways (P = 0.03). A 1-SD (10 ng mL-1 ) increase in leptin was associated with a significant increase in infant weight change in female infants (0.62 kg, P = 0.02) but not male infants (0.11 kg, P = 0.48)., CONCLUSIONS: Higher TRAP exposures were associated with higher cord blood levels of leptin and high molecular weight adiponectin. These adipokines were associated with increased infant weight change in female infants, which may have implications for future obesity risk. Copyright © 2017 World Obesity Federation.

AB  - It is generally recognized that children born small-for-gestational age (SGA) have a 5-7 times higher risk of short stature than children born at normal size. It has been suggested that the programming of the endocrine axes occurs during critical phases of fetal development and is affected by intrauterine growth retardation. This study was undertaken to characterize the postnatal growth pattern and the final height of children born SGA, as part of a population- based study (n = 3,650), from birth to final height, and to evaluate the hormonal status in another group of prepubertal children born SGA (n = 134) without postnatal catch-up growth. The majority (88%) of 'healthy' full-term singleton SGA infants achieved catch-up growth during the first 2 years of life, and most of the increase in height occurred by 2 months of age. The SGA children who remained short at 2 years of age had a higher risk of short stature later in life. The risk of having a short final height (<-2 SDS) was five times higher for children with a low birth weight and seven times higher for those with a low birth length in comparison with children with a normal birth size. Moreover, about 20% of all children of short stature were born SGA. As a group, children born SGA will have a final height, expressed in SDS, as they had during the prepubertal years. This is in contrast to children, who became short postnatally. During puberty, these short children will have a mean height gain of 0.6 SDS for girls and 0.7 SDS for boys. The mean estimated secretion rate for growth hormone (GH) was lower in the short children born SGA compared with the reference groups born at an appropriate size for gestational age, of either short (p < 0.05) or normal stature (p < 0.001). Moreover, in the youngest children born SGA (2-6 years of age) a different pattern of GH secretion was found, with a high basal GH level, low peak amplitude, and high peak frequency. The majority of the children born SGA had levels of GH-binding protein within the range previously reported for normal children. However, the levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) and leptin were significantly reduced compared with the reference values (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively). In conclusion, the low spontaneous GH secretion rate and a disturbed GH secretion pattern, together with low serum levels of IGF-I, IGFBP-3 and leptin, might contribute to the reduced postnatal growth in some of the subgroup of children born SGA who remained short during childhood.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The positive relationship between fat mass, bone mass and leptin has been shown in fetal mouse cartilage/bone. It has been shown that umbilical venous leptin predicts both the size of the neonatal skeleton and its estimated volumetric mineral density., AIMS: This study investigates how birth weight and bone mineralization correlate with leptin levels. In addition, we aimed to determine the predictive value of anthropometrics measurements and gender on variability in bone mineral status., METHODS: Umbilical cord venous blood samples were obtained at the delivery from 100 term newborn infants. Forty of the newborn infants had birth weights appropriate for gestational age (AGA), 30 were small for gestational age (SGA) and 30 were large for gestational age (LGA). Data were acquired using the whole body dual energy X-ray obsorptiometry scanner in the first 24 h after birth., RESULTS: Leptin concentrations were higher in LGA (36.6 +/-12.0 ng/ml; p < 0.0001), but lower in SGA (11.7 +/- 5.6 ng/ml; p < 0.001) than in AGA infants (20.3 +/- 7.6 ng/ml). Whole body bone mineral density and whole body bone mineral content were higher in LGA babies (0.442 +/- 0.025 g/cm(2), 71.6 +/- 9.0 g, p < 0.01, p < 0.001, respectively) but lower in SGA (0.381 +/- 0.027 g/cm(2), 29.1 +/- 9.1 g, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, respectively) than in AGA babies (0.426 +/- 0.022 g/cm(2), 53.7 +/- 9.6 g, respectively). The percentage of whole body bone mineral content was lower in SGA (1.3 +/- 0.3) than in AGA (1.6 +/- 0.2, p < 0.001) and LGA (1.7 +/- 0.2, p < 0.001). In stepwise linear regression analyses models; leptin is not found related to the bone indices., CONCLUSION: Our study does not provide support for the hypothesis that leptin may play a major role in the regulation of bone metabolism in the developing skeleton.

AB  - The potentiation of the immune system in pregnant rats was performed with Complete Freund's Adjuvant [CFA; 20 mu l, subcutaneous at gestation day (GD) 18] in experimentally-induced hyperthyroidism by Levo-thyroxine (L-T4; 10 mu l/100 g of b.w., intraperitoneal from GD 2 to 17). The potential effects on the fetal neuroendocrine function were evaluated by observing some histopathological investigations in pregnant rats and measuring some biochemical parameters in dams and their fetuses at GD 20. In hyperthyroid group, an increase in matemofetal serum thyroxine (T4), triiodothyronine (T3) and a decrease in thyrotropin (TSH) levels were noticed, while the concentrations of fetal serum growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) levels were increased at tested GD with respect to control and CFA groups. Moreover, the activity of uterine and placental myeloperoxidase (MPO) was increased (P < 0.001) in CFA and CFA-treated hyperthyroid groups in respect to control or hyperthyroid groups, respectively. The gestational thyrotoxicosis led to some histopathological lesions in uterine and placental tissues characterized by severe degeneration in trophoblast spongioblast cell layer with congestion, mild congested blood vessels in the endometrium and deficient in spiral artery remodeling. Although, the elevation in fetal serum transforming growth factor-beta (TGF beta) and cerebellar monoamines [norepineprine (NE), epinephrine (E), dopamine (DA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] was observed, the reduction in fetal serum tumor necrosis factor-alphan(TNF alpha) and adipokines (Leptin and adiponectin) was detected. Treatment of dams with CFA showed an obviously reversing and protecting effect against hyperthyroid perturbations. Thus, the maternal CFA can be used in treatment of the fetal neuroendocrine dysfunctions. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Circulating leptin levels positively correlate with adult BMI and size at birth. Previous studies found gender-specific associations between polymorphisms in the leptin gene and postnatal obesity-related traits or circulating leptin levels. We examined the relationships among leptin gene polymorphisms, size for gestational age, umbilical cord leptin, and gender., METHODS: Six single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in the leptin gene in 261 newborns (72 low birth weight Caucasians, 189 randomly-selected African-Americans). In African-Americans, umbilical cord leptin and free testosterone levels were measured. Linear regression was used to identify significant predictors of size for gestational age or cord leptin levels and gender x genotype interaction effects., RESULTS: There is a significant interaction between gender and genotype at site -2548 (A/G). Among low birth weight Caucasians, the A allele was associated with an increase in female size for gestational age, while the A allele was associated with decreased male birth size. Among African-Americans, the A allele was associated with a decrease in umbilical cord leptin in females and with an increase in cord leptin in males. Cord testosterone levels were not a significant predictor of cord leptin levels either among all African-American newborns or among strata of -2548 genotypes and gender., CONCLUSION: In male and female fetuses, site -2548 of the leptin gene may differently affect the expression level of the leptin gene or the rate of fetal growth. This gender-specific effect does not appear to be mediated by the level of free testosterone at delivery.

AB  - Introduction: Leptin, along with its receptor, are linked with mechanisms affecting a diverse array of pregnancy-specific pathologies that include gestational diabetes and intrauterine growth restriction. The goal of the study was to examine if there was a link between the leptin (LEP)/leptin receptor (LEPR) gene polymorphism and insulin resistance in pregnant women, and to determine the extent to which the leptin gene polymorphism could cause insulin resistance.. Methods: 208 pregnant women participated in this cross-sectional study of which 74 were insulin resistant cases and 134 were insulin sensitive controls. The study was carried out from December 2018 to December 2020 at a charitable hospital in Mangalore, Karnataka, India. Genotyping of leptin and its receptor gene were carried out using the Polymerase Chain Reaction- Restriction fragment Length Polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) method. Serum levels of leptin, insulin, and C peptide were assayed using Enzyme Linked Immuno Sorbent Assay (ELISA). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS 23. Results: Insignificant association was observed between leptin receptor gene polymorphisms and insulin resistance, and leptin gene and insulin resistant women. There was no significant difference in the serum leptin levels among the cases and control (61.62+/-29.23 and 59.88+/-22.25). However, fasting blood sugar, insulin, C peptide, Triglycerides (TG), and very low-density Lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were significantly higher in cases as compared to controls (p=0.0068, p<0.0001, p<0.0001 and 0.01 respectively). Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA IR) was greater in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'GG' of LEPR (p=0.0409) and hyperinsulinemia (p=0.023) as compared to other genotypes. However, hyperglycaemia was observed in subjects with homozygous dominant, 'AA' of leptin gene (p=0.0173). Conclusion: No significant association was found between leptin and leptin receptor gene polymorphisms with insulin resistance in pregnancy. However, genotyping of these genes may be useful in predicting insulin resistance and gestational diabetes in pregnancy. Copyright: © 2022 Adiga U et al.

AB  - Intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) predisposes obesity in adulthood. This may be due to altered fetal nutrition causing sustained changes within the developing hypothalamic energy balance regulatory system. Using our established ovine model of IUGR, 130-day singleton fetuses (term=147 days) were obtained from growing adolescent mothers on control dietary intake (C), high intake (H) or H with growth hormone administration during either early (H+early GH) or late gestation (H+late GH) (n=6/group). GH increased maternal glycemia for the duration of treatment. H and H+early GH fetuses showed IUGR compared with C fetuses; body weight was partially restored in H+late GH fetuses, with 40% increased adiposity. In the fetal hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC), cocaine- and amphetamine-regulated transcript mRNA (anorexigenic) was decreased in H fetuses and correlated across all groups with total fetal liver glycogen. Neuropeptide Y, agouti-related peptide (orexigenic) and proopiomelanocortin (anorexigenic) mRNAs were not different between groups. Insulin receptor mRNA in the ARC was increased in H, H+early GH and H+late GH fetuses and correlated negatively with fetal plasma insulin. Leptin receptor mRNA in the ARC correlated positively with fetal plasma leptin concentration and fetal fat content. Therefore, in IUGR fetuses, a key anorexigenic neuropeptide is sensitive to altered glucose supply and the hypothalamic leptin-signaling pathway is altered prenatally by increased adiposity and leptinemia. These changes could impact on postnatal energy balance regulation. Copyright © 2011 ISDN. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Fetal programming by androgen excess is hypothesized as one of the main factors contributing to the development of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is more than a reproductive disorder, as women with PCOS also show metabolic and other endocrine alterations. Since both ovarian and reproductive functions depend on energy balance, the alterations in metabolism may be related to reproductive alterations. The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of androgen excess during prenatal life on ovarian fuel sensors and its consequences on steroidogenesis. To this end, pregnant rats were hyperandrogenized with testosterone and the following parameters were evaluated in their female offspring: follicular development, PPARG levels, adipokines (including leptin, adiponectin, and chemerin as ovarian fuel sensors), serum gonadotropins (LH and FSH), the mRNA of their ovarian receptors, and the expression of steroidogenic mediators. At 60 days of age, the prenatally hyperandrogenized (PH) female off-spring displayed both an irregular ovulatory phenotype and an anovulatory phenotype with altered follicular development and the presence of cysts. Both PH groups showed altered levels of both proteins and mRNA of PPARG and a different expression pattern of the adipokines studied. Although serum gonadotropins were not impaired, there were alterations in the mRNA levels of their ovarian receptors. The steroidogenic mediators Star, Cyp11a1, Cyp17a1, and Cyp19a1 were altered differently in each of the PH groups. We concluded that androgen excess during prenatal life leads to developmental programming effects that affect ovarian fuel sensors and steroidogenesis in a phenotype-specific way.

AB  - To evaluate relationships between maternal and fetal adiponectin concentrations and lipoprotein and glycemic parameters in mother-and-child unity at birth, a study was performed with 90 women admitted in the delivery room after a free enlightened consent. Blood samples were taken simultaneously at delivery from mothers (peripheral venous) and newborns (umbilical cord) for glucose, cholesterol, triglyceride, and adiponectin determinations. Multiple correlations between different parameters were made. Adiponectin concentrations in cord blood were three times higher than in the mother's blood, while total, HDL and LDL cholesterol concentrations were higher in mothers. We demonstrated a slight inverse correlation between maternal adiponectin and gestational age (P=0.026) and between maternal adiponectin and concentrations of triglycerides in mothers (P=0.066). On the other hand, there were positive correlations between adiponectin concentrations, both in mothers and newborns, and LDL cholesterol concentrations in newborns (P=0.0072 and P=0.028, respectively). We inferred that at the end of pregnancy the mother undergoes a situation of insulin resistance, with a decrease in adiponectin concentrations. This may cause the re-routing of her metabolites towards the fetus who under insulin sensitivity would use those metabolites for its metabolic needs. If maternal insulin resistance is higher because of obesity or diabetes, the fetus would receive more metabolites than necessary and would store them as long as its biosynthetic needs are met. This could lead to macrosomia at birth and to obesity afterwards.

AB  - BackgroundTo investigate the association of adipocytokines and other inflammatory markers with development of GDM. MethodsSerum adipocytokines and inflammatory markers were studied at 12 to 15weeks gestation using biobanked control samples from a randomised trial. Study participants were identified as high risk for GDM using a validated clinical risk prediction tool. Markers were tested using commercial ELISA kits for high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin, interleukin-6 (IL-6), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, visfatin, omentin-1, sex-hormone binding globulin, monocyte chemoattractant protein, and asymmetrical dimethylarginine. The association between each biomarker and development of GDM at 24 to 28weeks was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis adjusted for maternal factors. ResultsThere were no differences in age, parity, country of birth, smoking, body mass index, or family history of diabetes in women with normal glucose tolerance (n=78) and women who developed GDM (n=25). Women with GDM were more likely to have a past history of GDM (P=0.004). HMW adiponectin (odds ratio OR 0.37 [95% confidence interval 0.19-0.74]), omentin-1 (0.97 [0.94-0.99]), and IL-6 (1.87[1.03-3.37]) were associated with development of GDM, after adjustment for maternal age, body mass index, and past history of GDM. The other markers were not associated with GDM development. ConclusionsDecreased high molecular weight adiponectin and omentin-1 and increased IL-6 may enhance sensitivity of early risk prediction tools for women at high risk of GDM. This may allow early identification and opportunities for prevention of GDM and adverse outcomes. Further research is required in large validation studies to confirm these results.

AB  - To date, a variety of experiments were done to get animal models of diabetes types. The current study is a trial to get a Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) model which is comparable to that in human, using a minimal dose of Streptozotocin (STZ). Female albino rats were divided into two groups; one fed Normal Diet (ND) and the other fed Fatty-Sucrosed Diet (FSD) from 60 days of age onward. After five weeks on the diets (pregestational period), rats were mated and STZ (25 mg/kg b. wt.) was injected intraperitoneally to FSD-fed dams at the 7th day of gestation. During pregestational period, FSD-fed rats exhibited significant increase in body weight that reduced significantly after STZ injection in comparable to ND-fed rats. Frank hyperglycemia with mild decrease in serum insulin level of Gestational Diabetic (GD) dams showed a state of insulin resistance that clarified by the increase in Homeostasis Model Assessment Of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and subsequent decrease in Quantitative Insulin Sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) values. Also, blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fructosamine were significantly increased while hepatic glycogen content was decreased. In addition, lipid profile of GD-dams showed a significant increase in levels of Triglycerides (TG), total-cholesterol (Total-Ch.), LDL-cholesterol (LDL-Ch.) and vLDL-cholesterol (vLDLCh.) while HDL-cholesterol (HDL-Ch.) was decreased. Furthermore, serum adipokines levels showed a significant increase in leptin and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) while adiponectin level was significantly decreased. On the other hand, the diabetic dams exhibited high rate of implantation loss and impaired fetal glycaemia. In conclusion the combination of FSD and a minimal dose of STZ can effectively induce gestational diabetes analogue to that of human and suitable for further investigations of physiological and molecular abnormalities in GDM.

AB  - Background: Leptin and adiponectin, which are primarily produced by adipose tissue, have recently been identified as key mediators in the foetal developmental process. Modulation of these adipokines in early life, therefore, provides potential opportunities to improve or reverse the adverse complications associated with an abnormal foetal developmental profile. Aim(s): The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of maternal dietary habits on foetal leptin and adiponectin levels on foetal developmental outcomes. Subjects and Methods: Sixty-two mothers between the ages of 18 years and 38 years, as well as their full-term neonates, were enrolled in this study, whether they had a normal delivery or a Cesarean section, with no birth complications. All mothers were subjected to a full pregnancy history in order to determine their gestational age, as well as a full examination that included measuring and recording all of their anthropometric measurements. Clinical examinations were performed on newborns, and the Apgar score was also recorded. Newborns were classified as Small for Gestational Age (SGA), Appropriate for Gestational Age (AGA), or Large for Gestational Age (LGA) based on their birth weight (LGA). ELIZA measured leptin and adiponectin levels in both mother's serum and cord blood serum. Result(s): Mothers who consumed fish and fats during pregnancy were not at risk of having SGA babies, and SGA babies had significantly lower adiponectin levels than AGA and LGA babies. Leptin levels increased significantly as they passed from SGA to LGA. Leptin distribution was significantly higher in infants of mothers who consumed daily breakfast during pregnancy than in infants of mothers who did not consume breakfast. Infant adiponectin distribution was significantly higher in infants of mothers who ate regular fats than in infants of mothers who ate a low fat diet. Infant adiponectin distribution was significantly higher in infants of mothers who consumed sugary drinks once per day than in infants of mothers who did not consume sugary drinks. Furthermore, there is a significant positive correlation between infant weight, infant length, infant head circumference, infant mid-arm circumference, and levels of both infant leptin and infant adiponectin. A highly significant negative correlation was found between mother adiponectin and infant leptin levels, while a highly significant positive correlation was found between mother leptin and infant leptin levels. Conclusion(s): This study shed light on the important role of maternal nutrition during pregnancy in foetal body fat composition. This study also provides clear evidence for the influence of leptin and adiponectin on foetal development.Copyright © 2021 Scientific Publishers of India. All rights reserved.

AB  - Neonates born to overweight or obese women are more likely to be large for gestational age. It has been noted that maternal obesity-related traits are observationally associated with birth weight; however, the causal nature of these associations is uncertain. The objective of this study was to test for genetic evidence of causal associations of maternal body mass index (BMI) and related traits with birth weight. In this study, a technique referred to as "Mendelian randomization" was used to analyze whether there was a causal relationship between maternal BMI and each related trait by testing associations between maternal genetic risk scores and offspring birth weights. In addition to BMI, traits were selected that are associated with maternal obesity and may affect fetal growth through the intrauterine environment. Single nucleotide polymorphism genotype data were used from 30,487 women participating in 18 population-or community-based studies in Europe, North America, or Australia. The study included live, term, singleton offspring born between 1929 and 2013. Maternal traits that were investigated in this study included genetic scores for BMI, fasting glucose level, type 2 diabetes, systolic blood pressure (SBP), triglyceride level, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level, vitamin D status, and adiponectin level. The primary outcome and measure from the 18 studies was offspring birth weight. Results of the study indicated that, among the 30,487 newborns, the mean birth weight in the various cohorts ranged from 3325 to 3679 g. The maternal genetic score for BMI was associated with a 2-g (95% confidence interval [CI], 0 to 3 g) higher offspring birth weight per maternal BMI-raising allele (P = 0.008). In addition, the maternal genetic scores for fasting glucose and SBP were associated with birth weight with effect sizes of 8 g (95% CI, 6 to 10 g) per glucose-raising allele (P = 7 x 10-14) and -4 g (95% CI, -6 to -2 g) per SBP-raising allele (P = 1 x 10-5), respectively. A 1-SD (approximate to 4 points) genetically higher maternal BMI was associated with a 55-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 17 to 93 g); a 1-SD (approximate to 7.2 mg/dL) genetically higher maternal fasting glucose concentration was associated with 114-g higher offspring birth weight (95% CI, 80 to 147 g), and a 1-SD (approximate to 10 mm Hg) genetically higher maternal SBP was associated with a 208-g lower offspring birth weight (95% CI, -394 to -21 g). It was also observed that for BMI and fasting glucose, genetic associations were consistent with the observational associations. The study concludes that genetically elevated maternal BMI and blood glucose levels were potentially causally associated with higher offspring birth weight, whereas genetically elevated maternal SBP was potentially causally related to lower birth weight. The study recommends that if replicated, these findings may have implications for counseling and managing pregnancies to avoid adverse weight-related birth outcomes.
